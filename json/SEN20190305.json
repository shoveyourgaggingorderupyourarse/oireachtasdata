I appreciate he is taking time out of his busy schedule.  One thing I can say about the Minister is he comes to the Seanad and engages with Senators and I acknowledge this.  I know Members appreciate when a Minister comes to the House and the Minister, Deputy Ross, does so when at all possible.  I acknowledge this and thank him for it.<\/p> <p>I do not want to go into this at length as we have had a few argy-bargies about driver tests and I do not want to get too bogged down in the figures.  Suffice it to say, today I contacted the RSA, which I do regularly, and I acknowledge its support in sending on updated details.  While I do not want to get bogged down in the details, the email I received from the RSA confirmed that 76,964 applicants are on the driver test list.  Of these, 30,370 tests have been scheduled and a further 25,079 applicants are waiting for a test date.  The remaining 21,514 applicants are unavailable for testing, for example, because an applicant has not completed the mandatory driver test lessons.  In essence, today 55,000 people are waiting for a driver test.<\/p> <p>The Minister remembers telling us the RSA was engaging more testers.  I followed this up with the RSA to discover a number of testers were due to retire in November and December.  This means that while new people were coming on stream other people were due to retire.  There is also a training period of six to eight weeks.  What we are saying is we have an issue.  What is really important, and the Minister knows this from speaking to his rural colleagues, is that the majority of young people living in rural Ireland depend on their cars for college, work and daily life.  They need an opportunity to do their test and, therefore, to demonstrate their ability to drive safely on our roads.  I know this is paramount for the Minister.<\/p> <p>What additional resources can be put in place to speed up this process?  Has the Minister or the RSA considered outsourcing some of the testing?  For that matter, would it be appropriate to consider this?  It was done in the past.  Professional people with competence in this area of testing and examination could be brought in to eat into the backlog.  Today, in Tallaght, 2,754 people are listed as scheduled for an appointment, in Cork the figure is 2,491, in Finglas the figure is 2,699 and in Churchtown, the Minister's home patch, the figure is 1,466.  Will the Minister look favourably at supporting whatever mechanisms are necessary to get a grip on these very long waiting lists that are causing concern, in particular to rural people and rural communities?<\/p> <p>I am aware that since December there have been 350 cases of cars of unaccompanied learner drivers being seized.  I do not condone learner drivers driving unaccompanied.  It is not right that people who are not fully competent and tested are driving.  We cannot allow people to break the law.  On the other hand, we must support these people to be able to do their test as quickly as possible, demonstrate their competence and be allowed to get out on the road.  Will the Minister update us on some of the figures?  How does the Minister intend to use his office to influence speedier reductions in these lists?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#B00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I never get weary of responding to this question because it is important.  I hope the response and the achievements will be acknowledged by those who have, quite rightly, raised it in the past.  The driver test service is provided by the Road Safety Authority.  I am very aware of the current waiting times for driver tests throughout the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept waiting times at some centres remain high.  Measures being put in place, however, by the Road Safety Authority are working towards reducing waiting times for the public.  The Road Safety Authority's target for a national average time for a driver test is no longer than ten weeks.  Of the 50 test centres around the country, 33 now meet this target, with many coming in under ten weeks.  The current average wait time, as of 4 March 2019, is 8.8 weeks.  Some centres, such as Carrick-on-Shannon, Castlebar, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Deansgrange, Finglas, Letterkenny, Naas, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford are at six weeks or less.  There are, however, some centres where the wait time is considerably longer.  <br\/><br\/>The longest average wait times are currently in Wicklow, at 17.6 weeks, and Kilrush, at 15.9 weeks.  The average waiting time for driver tests at all centres are available on the Road Safety Authority's website,<i>www.rsa.ie<\/i>.  This information is updated weekly.  It should be noted that the figure shown in the longest wait time column is the longest time that one, or more, applicants has been waiting for a test.  It is not the average wait time.  That figure is likely due to issues such as non-completion of the mandatory 12 EDT lessons, fee payments outstanding or an applicant rescheduling an appointment.  <br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that an applicant can apply to sit the driver test at any test centre in the country.  In 2018, following my approval, the Road Safety Authority recruited 52 driver testers and another 14 driver testers are undergoing training.  In addition, it is planned to recruit eight more driver testers in March.  Including the 14 driver testers in training, there are now 147.94 full-time equivalent driver testers available for deployment.  This provides an annual capacity of 260,000 driving tests.  Despite an increase in applications for driver tests, which may reflect legislative changes in respect of enforcing the existing law on unaccompanied learner drivers, the Clancy amendment, as well as ongoing economic and demographic growth, there is a gradual reduction in waiting times at almost all test centres.<br\/><br\/>With the additional resources available, as well as those coming on stream, waiting times will continue to reduce at all test centres.  The Road Safety Authority provides a facility where driving test cancellations are made available to applicants who may need an urgent appointment.  An applicant should contact the Road Safety Authority directly and request that he or she be placed on the cancellation list.  In order to be fair to all applicants, cancellation places will be assigned in order of the date of placement on the list.  If an applicant requires a driver test urgently, for employment or emigration purposes, the Road Safety Authority will make every effort to accommodate that person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#B00300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his report.

It is really important as the lives of so many people have been changed by it as well, including by robotics.  Many people are involved with the research and we are promoting this in a very positive way.  Companies use these strategies to drive their future and make their operations more cost-effective.

Such decisions are taken by the board of management of a school which has ultimate responsibility for the direct governance of a school, including the safeguarding of students' welfare.  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, however, sets out my Department's policy on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment.  A key action of the strategy is the promotion of the responsible and ethical use of the Internet and related technologies.<\/p><p>In addition, there are a number of resources and supports available to schools.  The action plan on bullying focuses on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed.  Awareness on Internet safety for schools is carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers, otherwise known as PDST, technology in education in partnership with the safer Internet Ireland project.  Webwise, an Internet safety initiative co-funded by my Department and operated by the PDST technology in education, promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the Internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy that targets parents, teachers and children with consistent and relevant messages, including guidance on acceptable usage in schools.<\/p><p>A range of resources has been developed which helps teachers integrate Internet safety into teaching and learning in their schools.  Last month, the HTML Heroes resource was launched, which aims to assist and support educators when teaching children aged between seven and ten years about the safe and responsible use of the Internet, including social media.  PDST technology in education also provides continuing professional development, CPD, and resources that help teachers integrate the safe and ethical use of the Internet into teaching and learning.<\/p><p>Under the broadband for schools programme, schools are provided with a portfolio of network services, including the security and filtering of content.  The Government Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019 is being implemented by a sponsors' group under the chair of the Department of Education and Skills.  Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, announced his intention to bring forward an online safety Bill, which will set out how we can ensure the further safety of children online.

There has been recent media coverage about issues relating to boom time construction.  I have been dealing with a group of residents in the Belmayne area.  I am reluctant to name particular areas because of the reputational damage doing so can cause but we are at the stage where the relevant information is in media circles.  It is time for action.<\/p><p><i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported this week about apartments in Clongriffin and about owners facing a bill of &euro;826,000 to remedy serious fire safety issues found at their block.  Residents have been informed that fire would not be contained within any compartment of the building for more than 30 minutes - rather than the 60 minutes required under the regulations - and the owners will have to pay between &euro;4,246 and &euro;6,676 per apartment to remedy the defects.  A letter was recently circulated as a result of a public meeting I organised with my colleague, Mr. Shane Folan, in Belmayne.  The letter was sent by the management company to residents.  It outlined that the management company was due to proceed with an immediate fire safety inspection and it intended to complete a further survey of the balconies in the block.  The management company has accepted that the balconies are defective.  Further surveys will identify what repair work is required.<\/p><p>The residents want to know who is on their side.  There is any amount of overlapping interest between management companies, developers, Dublin City Council and the fire officer.  The residents want to know if the Government is on their side.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is suggesting that the Government establish an emergency fund in order to assist these residents.  I presume the Minister of State will agree that the owners of apartments which are proven to be defective should not be left out of pocket.  Some of these residents have already been obliged to dish out &euro;3,000 in order to find out if their apartments were affected by pyrite.  These residents are victims of boom time construction which has proven to be defective.  They want to know if the Government is going to be on their side.  Is the Government going to advocate for them or is it going to wash its hands of this matter?<\/p><p>At the time of the Priory Hall issue, the former leader of the Labour Party and former Deputy, Eamon Gilmore, was proactive in meeting and talking with residents and anybody who could find solutions to that situation.

In general, building defects are matters to be resolved between the contracting parties, in other words, owners, builders, developers and their respective insurers or structural guarantee or warranty schemes.  While the Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for affected homeowners.<\/p> <p>In the case of multi-unit development such as the Belmayne development to which the Senator referred, the legislative position is very clear in terms of where responsibilities lie.  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the building regulations, including Part B which has regard to fire safety, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  The aim of the building regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings.  Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and which are independent in the use of their statutory powers.  As such, I am not in a position to comment on a specific development.<\/p> <p>When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 to the person having control of the building.  In multi-unit developments, the person having control is generally the management company.  Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner or management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement and maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p> <p>In terms of addressing fire safety issues, it should be noted that in 2017 the Department published a framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings where concerns arise.  This framework is a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified or are a cause for concern.  Furthermore, in the aftermath of the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed in respect of fire safety, the Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management was asked to convene a task force to lead a reappraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report the task force acknowledged the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and made a number of recommendations, which are being implemented. <\/p> <p>In response to the building failures that have emerged over the past decade, the Department has advanced a robust and focused building control reform agenda which has included amendments to the building control regulations, the establishment of a shared services national building control project, and the ongoing development of new legislation through the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill.  These reforms have brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with building regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#G00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Residents are looking at costs of thousands of euro to fix the apartments in which they live.  The stress this imposes on their day-to-day lives is immeasurable.  I would suggest that we need a better response from the Department, and I ask the Minister of State to impress on Deputy Eoghan Murphy the need for a better response and for him to get off the fence and stand in the residents' corner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#G00300","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I do not accept that the Department is neutral, nor should it be.

I know he will relay my concerns to the Minister.<\/p><p>Last week, conditions at the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's Hospital came to public attention following a case which the Mental Health Commission took against the HSE under the Mental Health Act, the first such case to be taken.  Staff, parents, patients and loved ones have detailed many of the issues that were found during an unannounced inspection of the unit which took place between 6 November and 9 November.  I am deeply concerned that the voices of those using and working in the facility are not being heard and that it takes an unannounced inspection and a court decision for anything to be done.  I have highlighted the unacceptable overcrowding at this facility a number of times, both here and in meetings of the mental health committee.  I am appalled that it was used as an excuse for not having cleanliness as a standard in the facility.  I have been on record to highlight patients being left on corridors, on floors in the TV rooms and on couches but the conditions in this case are staggering in the levels of deprivation on display.<\/p><p>How have we arrived at this point?  Is there a culture in hospitals whereby patients seek mental healthcare in which everything is operated without adhering to standards until somebody is caught?  I am concerned that these conditions are standard and I would like to be assured that they are not.  I would like to be assured that these conditions will never happen again and I would like to be assured that there will be some accountability here.<\/p><p>For far too long, mental health issues have been ignored, stigmatised and demonised.  We have buried our mentally ill in basements and back rooms under the veil of shuttered windows and barred doors.  We need to clean up our attitudes and adopt modern attitudes in our facilities.  We need to shed light on any kind of activity that demonises people who are in need of mental health.  I am getting sick and tired of controversies over how we treat each other in this country.  The patients in these facilities are the most vulnerable people and they matter, but it was disturbing, to say the least, to listen to my constituents tell me stories of being in the facility and leaving their beds to use the bathroom, only to return to find someone else in their bed, sometimes without clothing on, and to hear their harrowing tales of filth, dirt and unsanitary conditions.<\/p><p>What is the level of supervision of patients across the service?  Why was this type of story repeated to me from several different perspectives?  I heard from staff in the units who were exasperated with the workload, overwhelmed with actual care and unable to rectify maintenance issues.  These staff need help to do their jobs and that is where the HSE comes in.  We cannot have a situation where patients using mental healthcare facilities have nowhere to spend recreational time.  They see blatant drug use and go to their bed at night in fear of opening their eyes and what they might see upon doing so.  These patients are looking for help and what they are receiving is the stuff of torment and nightmares.  It is too late when whistleblowers come forward and when unannounced inspections have to be relied upon to catch these things.  What sort of a culture exists in\u00a0the service?  The public deserves to know that there is\u00a0a standard of care across the board.  These are most vulnerable patients.  They cannot rely on themselves or other patients to look after them.  We cannot, again and again, force hard-pressed people into the private system.<\/p><p>This Government does\u00a0not care about the people who, through no fault of their own, are in financial distress but have to access the public health system for mental care.  It is unacceptable to have a facility where there is dirt on the floor and walls and the bedding is of an extremely hazardous material.  There has to be a standard from the outset and not in response to a judge.  People die, disappear and lose themselves in our system and the Minister has to find a way to ensure these things do not happen.  There seems to be money everywhere except where it needs to be put and I am asking the Minister to reassure me and the people of this country that not only will there be accountability, there will be root and branch investigations of all our facilities so that we create a culture of operating at the highest standard, and not just when an inspector arrives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#H00700","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am taking this on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly.

We have increased the HSE&rsquo;s mental health budget by more than &euro;245 million since 2012.  This has helped to fund a number of initiatives aimed at reducing demand on the mental health services.  It has provided, for example, an extra 130 psychiatric nurse undergraduates places each year to come onstream in 2020 to 2021.  In addition, 40 postgraduate places have been funded.  Together with the recent appointment by the HSE of around 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists into primary care and ten advanced nurse practitioners directly into the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, it is anticipated these posts will help to deal with the increased demand for CAMHS.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million for the development of mental health services.  The additional funding allocated to mental health services since 2012 has provided for the recruitment of nearly 1,700 new development posts in mental health.  In the last year, the number of staff across the mental health service has increased by 163.  The number of consultants has increased by 14 while the number of nurses has increased by 41.  There are widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist mental health staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists.  We accept there is a problem in that respect.<\/p><p>Every possible option is being pursued in order to recruit while acknowledging the critical impact medical vacancies have on service provision.  To tackle this a dedicated medical manpower officer has been appointed.  In addition, local management is working with 11 national and international agencies to source suitably qualified candidates.  All options are being explored, including the provision of out-of-hours or weekend clinics by a consultant working elsewhere. <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will be overseeing the roll-out a tele-counselling pilot project in 2019.  This will ascertain the merits of delivering care from a distance using technology and video-conferencing.  Tele-counselling can provide a range of services, including psychiatric evaluations, individual, group and family therapy, education and patient management.  The Minister of State expects the introduction of tele-health services will expand over time to create additional capacity in psychiatry.  Tele-health initiatives may offer flexible opportunities for consultants to work from their chosen location or in supported tele-hubs located in more convenient areas.  This should increase the overall attractiveness of the advertised posts resulting in a higher success rate of filling the vacant positions.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has also met the HSE's executive clinical directors to discuss the recruitment and retention issues.  He has written to them to request further suggestions on how recruitment might be improved.<\/p><p>The Mental Health Commission has an important part to play in ensuring that our psychiatric units are of a sufficiently high standard.  The commission has responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#J00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The proportion of approved applicants who draw down the loans appears to be higher than 50%.  Using basic mathematics, it seems there will not be enough money in the fund for those who would like to draw down the loans.  These are people on the margins who are vulnerable and are relying on the Rebuilding Ireland home loans.<\/p><p>There are many questions that we must ask.  I note during Leaders' Questions today, my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, put many questions to the Taoiseach and was unable to get clarification.  For instance, what exactly is the Central Bank's view on the home loans?  The Minister, in December, stated he would provide another fund.  Today, the Taoiseach was unable to give my party any answers as to whether that will be the case and indicated he would ask more questions.  Was this fund a mistake?  Is it reckless lending on the part of the Government?  What is the current status of the fund?  Has the Minister directed that no more loans are to be approved?  The Minister has described the fund as a success.  If it is the case that the fund has been closed and no more approvals will be made, this is a loud noise that we are hearing over and over again.  It is important to have a debate on the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme.  We need facts because people are relying on these loans and if the shutters are coming down, they need to know what their options are.<\/p><p>A report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on struggling families titled, Working, Parenting and Struggling?, has found that one in 11 working lone parents was living below the poverty line in 2012 and that number had jumped to one in five by 2017.  It is clear we are not doing enough for working parents.  Unfortunately, Dublin South Central has one of the highest rates of lone parents, many of whom are women.  The Government needs to do much more to support women who are lone parents to ensure resources are available to them and to allow them to go back to work and support their children and ensure their children are not living in abject poverty and enjoy equality of opportunity, as other children do.<\/p><p>The use of electric motorised scooters is an issue that has been in the press.  We see these scooters in cycle lanes.  Clarity is needed on whether the Garda should enforce road safety laws or whether this is in the remit of Dublin City Council.  We need clarification on whether these motorised scooters should be insured.  We need a short debate in this House on the issue.  I drive every day and these scooters seem to be on the increase.

I was very disappointed to have reported to me - I do not tweet or receive tweets - that the Minister for Justice and Equality had stated that the conduct of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 in the Seanad underlined the urgent need for root and branch Seanad reform or a second referendum.  I was disappointed to hear that from the Minister, especially since he is conducting the Third Stage of this legislation in this House.  On 27 February, the European Commission published a report on Ireland, which stated the following:<\/p><blockquote>The proposed composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission, which - according to the amended proposal - would comprise only five judges out of 17 (including a lay chairperson 'accountable to the Oireachtas') would not be in line with European standards (Council of Europe, 2010) and with the recommendation of the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (Group of States against Corruption, 2018) which require that an independent and competent authority drawn in substantial part from the judiciary be authorised to make recommendations or express opinions which the relevant appointing authority follows in practice.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Second, it stated:<\/p><blockquote>As to efficiency, the Court of Appeal, set up in 2014, has a considerable backlog and appears to be under-resourced as regards the number of judges.<br \/><br \/>A draft Bill providing for an increase in their number has been approved by the government.  <\/blockquote><p>It complains that this has not been progressed.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first one, this is, yet again, a condemnation of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill before this House.  Yet again, the European Commission is warning us that what we are doing is in breach of the GRECO report and in breach of the Council of Europe recommendations, yet it is being persisted with.  We have been told consistently in other places that, somehow, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill debate is holding up other legislation.  That is false.

These are parents who have done everything by the book.  They get up early in the morning, perhaps even earlier than the Taoiseach himself, yet they have been left behind.  This Government is failing working single parents who are living in poverty.  This is disgraceful not just because of the conditions in which lone parents now live, but because there are actions that need to be taken right now.<\/p> <p>The activation measures taken during the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government were only going to deliver one result, and this is it.  We said at the time that they would push more mothers and fathers parenting alone into poverty.  Who cares, though, so long as the Government can spin the numbers?  Who cares that there was a failure to back up these measures to increase employment with other policy changes, such as a reduction in the cost of childcare, rent reductions, family-friendly employment practices and greater access to education?  In Ireland, 84% of lone parents were unable to meet unexpected expenses.  This compares with an EU 15 average of 58%.  Unexpected expenses can mean a trip to the doctor or the dentist for either the parent or the child.  There is also a fear of other unexpected expenses.  This is why we see many lone parents being forced to deal with very unscrupulous moneylenders, who charge interest rates in the hundreds of per cent on the money they lend to lone parents and others.<\/p> <p>One of the recommendations included in the St. Vincent de Paul report is to benchmark social welfare payments, such as the jobseeker's transitional payment and the working family payment, to the cost of a minimum standard of living to ensure adequate income.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced legislation to this effect last year in the D&aacute;il, and I urge the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to consider this as one way in which we can lift lone-parent families out of poverty.<\/p> <p>Another recommendation that could be acted on immediately is to extend the cut-off age for the jobseeker's transitional payment until the youngest child is 18 to assist lone parents in ensuring they are actually better off at work.  I would suggest even beyond the age of 18.  I would suggest this should be extended to children still in education and going into third level education.  In the North there is the child maintenance service.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed that this be established here as well.<\/p> <p>Finally, SUSI must be extended to students studying part time to allow lone parents to access education while fulfilling their caring responsibilities.  I ask the Minister to come before the House to discuss this report.  I thank the St. Vincent de Paul not only for this report and the numerous other reports it has done, but for all it does for people struggling in poverty in this country.  Time and time again I have had to go to the St. Vincent de Paul on behalf of families, whether the issue be education or that they just cannot live.  They cannot exist.  Such families are dependent on the St. Vincent de Paul.  I commend all the volunteers in St. Vincent de Paul for the wonderful work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#Q00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The delay in legislation passing through the House has been mentioned many times in the press, especially in respect of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  May I give the Leader a commitment on behalf of my Labour Party colleagues and Senator Norris?  We will facilitate the passage of any legislation coming into this House as soon as it is ready.  I do not think the judicial appointments Bill is delaying the passage of any legislation through the House.  What we are seeing is what I would call spin rather than content.  If the Leader wants or needs to do so, I suggest he sit down with the leaders of the various groups and let us schedule the legislation he says is being delayed.  I do not believe any Senator is delaying any legislation.  What the Leader does not want is proper scrutiny and debate on the legislation before the House for his own reasons.<\/p> <p>I will raise one other issue with the Leader.  Both Senator Noone and I have raised the issue of breastfeeding and its importance for women who are returning to the workforce.  Two years ago I published a policy document on this issue for the Labour Party and we had hoped we would see real progress.  I point out to the Leader that teachers who breastfeed on their return to work are given one hour a day to express outside their lunchtime break, which is only correct and proper.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The long-term health and emotional benefits of breastfeeding are well known and well established.  Teachers have that proper and correct entitlement.  Special needs assistants, SNAs, who work beside their teaching colleagues in the same schools, do not, however, have the same entitlement to express breast milk.  They have to do it on an already scheduled 20 minute break.  This has been raised several times over the last eight months with the Minister for Education and Skills.  <\/p><p>The only response has been that the matter is under consideration.  We know the benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and for the child and there has to be a sense of urgency regarding this issue.  The constant answer that it is under consideration is not acceptable.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills and come back to us with a response.  I hope the response will break down this inequality between SNAs and teachers.  If the Minister cannot give a positive answer, then I will be raising this issue again for debate in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#Q00300","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I welcome the discussion provoked by Senator McDowell.

When I was growing up three Rs were used for reduce, reuse and recycle.  We are all now talking about climate change, climate action and what needs to be done.  We have a situation, however, at the moment where the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will not license recycling facilities for concrete and allow it be reused.  It has to be put back into the ground instead.<\/p> <p>As a consequence, more stone and rock has to be quarried and used.  I am referring to concrete that could be recycled and be perfectly usable for roadways and footpaths.  It is not suitable for building as there is a potential issue with pyrite, but it can be used for other construction projects such as in-farm roadways.  The EPA will not, however, grant licences to various highly-regarded companies that could produce this recycled material.  The concrete has to be disposed of in a landfill as a result.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to come to the House and address this matter.  It is a ludicrous situation.  This recyclable material could be reused in various forms in construction or in the farm sector and that would be good for the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#R00200","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am raising the issue of rural broadband.

That would be a more prudent use of resources.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Health said on this week's \"The Week in Politics\" that some of the Private Members' Bills brought forward in these Houses are poorly drafted.  He is right but in defence of Members who draft legislation, they do not have the resources of an entire Department at their disposal.  If a Department is willing to support, in principle, legislation, then there is an onus and a responsibility on the Department to draft amendments or to work with the legislator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#T00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We were all confounded by the latest threat and app in terms of the appropriateness of the Internet.

The incidence of measles is on the rise worldwide.  We have had some 70 cases so far this year, whereas the total last year was much lower than that.  There is a concern about the uptake of vaccination for notifiable diseases because if fewer than 95% of the population are vaccinated we lose the herd immunity.  The undermining of vaccines has gone on for a long time.  There are certain celebrity types in the US who use social media to a great extent to undermine vaccination.  We saw the scare mongering that went on when the HPV was provided.  I would like the Minister for Health to come to this Chamber to talk to us about the HSE health protection surveillance centre's information on the uptake of vaccination and the notification of notifiable diseases.  We need to achieve an uptake of 95% of the eligible population.  I know that the uptake figures are sadly lower.  This is a public health issue but lots of people are allowing a misunderstanding of the science to influence behaviour.  As legislators and as public representatives we need to continuously support the programme of vaccination and highlight the need for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019030500002#UUU00100","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1551796200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the 11 Members of the House for their contribution to the Order of Business.  Both Senators Ardagh and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, a Government backed mortgage scheme for first-time buyers launched in February 2018 with a projected 1,000 loans during a three-year period.  The scheme has exceeded expectation.  Some 575 people have been helped through this scheme to purchase their own home.  A further 1,000 applicants have been approved and have not drawn down the funding.  Both the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Taoiseach have said that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in negotiations with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about continuing this very important scheme which allows people who have been refused a loan by the banks to be able to purchase their own home.  We all want to see that happen.<\/p> <p>What the Members opposite did not say was that the Government is considering increasing the cap above &euro;200 million.  The Government is consulting with the Central Bank of Ireland regarding loans being approved.  As we all know this is a very important scheme for people which offers a pathway to being able to buy their own home.  I certainly hope that we can have this done quickly.  It is an important piece of the housing market.  Members will know that people who avail of loans under this scheme are those who have had their loan applications rejected for a variety of reasons by commercial banks.  I hope the Government, through the Central Bank of Ireland, will facilitate the continuation of this scheme and I very much look forward to the Government working to have the scheme re-opened.<\/p> <p>A number of Members have raised the report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Senators Ardagh and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I join with Members in commending and congratulating the volunteers of the society for the significant work they do in communities across our country.  They are a very important part of the social fabric of our society and assist many different people in a variety of ways.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the five-year period from 2012 to 2017 our country was in the depths of the worst recession ever.  Government took a number of steps in those times and subsequently to improve supports for lone parents.  For example, the income thresholds for the working family payment were raised, rates for qualified children were increased, the earnings disregard for one-parent families and jobseeker transition payments were increased, and back to school clothing and footwear allowance was also increased.  If an analysis of the four budgets from 2015 to 2019 was done, it would be seen that the average weekly income of lone parents has increased by &euro;43.75 for those in employment and by &euro;45 for those who are unemployed.  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;39.25 in the earnings of the average household.  As a result of budget 2019, lone parents working 15 hours a week at the national minimum wage are now better off by &euro;1,000 a year.  Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to visits to doctors.  It was this Government and the last Government that introduced the free GP scheme for those under six and those over 70.  I know that does not apply in this case, but some people will want to hear that.  I will be very happy to have the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, come to the House in respect of the scheme.  Last week the Children's Rights Alliance published its 2018 report card which showed that budget 2018 and budget 2019 included measures specifically aimed at supporting families on low incomes.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of electric and motorised scooters and the challenges they present.  I will have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House with regard to that matter.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell, Senator Boyhan and, indirectly, Senator Humphreys raised the issue of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  I am not going to add any fuel to the fire or add anything to Senator McDowell's comments regarding tweets and newspaper reports in respect of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill last weekend.  Members of this House have their views on the Bill and I respect those views entirely.  As Leader of the Seanad and on behalf of the Government, it is my job to facilitate all requests in the House.  Requests are made every day and I will always try to facilitate them.  If Senator Boyhan was discommoded, I sincerely apologise to him.  The email to the Cathaoirleach went out at 3.30 p.m. the day after the group meeting.  That is one day.  I do not believe that discommoded people but, if it did, I apologise.  As Senator Boyhan knows quite well, the schedule is an indicative schedule.  As I said in this House and in the group meeting, it is my intent to put the Bill on the schedule whenever the Minister for Justice and Equality is available.
