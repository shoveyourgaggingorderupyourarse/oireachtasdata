These changes, if implemented, will lead to the halving of nursing cover on a nightly basis.  My colleagues are extremely worried about the repercussions of this decision on staff welfare and safety and similarly the welfare and safety of prisoners to whom they have a duty of care as professionals registered with An Bord Altranais.<\/p> <p>Cloverhill prison is an extremely volatile working environment.  It receives committals from Leinster courts plus emergency committals from Donegal to Kerry where homicide charges are made.  It gets all Garda national immigration bureau committals from the airport for deportation.  Many of those committed have ingested drugs and require 24-hour observation.  A total of 60% of committals from the Bridewell Garda station have drug and alcohol addiction requiring immediate intervention for withdrawal.  Prisoners are accepted into the prison throughout the day and night.  This situation therefore requires 24-hour triage cover within the institution.  To suggest otherwise would be irresponsible and asking for trouble.  The prisoners who arrive at Cloverhill are of an extremely volatile nature.  Many are suffering from underlying physical and mental illnesses, abuse illegal substances and in most cases are addicted, pose a high suicide risk, are extremely vulnerable and have various other problems.  Deterioration in health due to these issues and more place an acute demand on the expertise of the nurses and one nurse simply could not meet the needs as outlined in the proposed new roster.<\/p> <p>Suicides are an ever present risk within the prison population.  To suggest one nurse could attend a suicide attempt and meet the needs demanded by this situation is impractical and reckless.  An incident which happened in 2014 was highlighted to me by the nurse concerned who attended the scene.  The nurse had 26 years nursing experience, but the scene she attended during that night was something she had never seen before.  She described it as a \"bloodbath\".  Her priority and that of her nursing colleague on that night was obviously the prisoner.  She vividly remembers the scene in the cell and says that were a similar incident to arise again, one nurse simply could not cope with the pressures.  We need two nurses for competent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR.  A great deal of CPR is administered in the prison following overdose and attempted suicide.  In some cases there are completed suicides.  <\/p> <p>The nurses' concerns have been consistently highlighted to prison management through their union but to no avail.  The responses and lack of acknowledgement of their concerns are extremely worrying.  In recent days, staff have become aware of rumours that the proposed roster changes will be shelved.  If this is the case, it is to be welcomed from all angles.  However, I would like to respond to my nursing colleagues and provide certainty to them that from here on, double cover will remain in place, that their safety and welfare, along with that of the prisoners, will remain more secure and the cloud of doubt resulting in a fraught atmosphere between staff and management can now lift.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State can provide me with that certainty this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#A00400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste, who could not be here to take the debate.  The T&aacute;naiste wishes to emphasise that the provision of health care is a statutory obligation of the Irish Prison Service, as defined in the prison rules of 2007.  She assures the Senator that the care and rehabilitation of persons in custody is a core aim of the Irish Prison Service.  The IPS health care standards outline its commitment to provide equivalence of care to the prisoner population in custody.  In this regard, the prison health care service seeks to provide prisoners with access to the same range and quality of health care services as are available under the medical card scheme in the community.<\/p> <p>Nursing care in the prison service has, historically, been provided by a group of staff referred to as medical orderlies, who are prison officers with some basic first-aid training.  In 1999, qualified registered nurses were first introduced to the Irish Prison Service.  The drivers of this development were mainly external and came from the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Penal Reform Trust, the Olden report and others.  The introduction of professional nursing services into the prison system greatly improved the quality and standard of care.  A prison nurse will generally work under the direction of a chief nurse officer and in partnership with prison doctors, while overall responsibility for the management of a prison or place of detention rests with the governor of the institution concerned.<\/p> <p>In recent years, the Irish Prison Service has experienced difficulties in recruiting nurses to work in prisons.  The 2015 competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service has resulted in 15 nurse appointments to date, and the IPS has been advised that the panel will not generate any further nurses for Dublin prisons.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, the IPS has recently concluded a comprehensive health care review which will provide for the deployment of nursing resources to prisons throughout the estate on a more consistent basis.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste advises the Senator that the IPS worked with the review partners to ensure that nurse resourcing in all Irish prisons is commensurate with the population of the prison, the profile of prisoners and the health care needs of the prison population.  The revised level of night nursing cover is considered appropriate in the context of demands for health care provision during the night shift.  Cloverhill carries out the bulk of its health care activity during the day, and night-time nursing activity tends to be concentrated between the hours of 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.  Following analysis, a proposal to enhance nursing resources at Cloverhill Prison was approved between IPS management and staffing representatives.  A prison nurse is responsible for maintaining a safe and clean clinical environment and will function as a primary health care provider.  The role of nursing staff encompasses not only general nursing care but also other services such as counselling, health education and promotion, and preventative medicine.  A prison nurse is required to maintain the highest standard of nursing care and to participate in a multidisciplinary team while also having regard to, and a clear understanding of, safe custody of an offender.  In addition, the prison nurse helps to create and maintain a therapeutic environment within the prison as a whole and works with doctors, other nurses and prison staff as a professional member of a therapeutic team.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste reiterates that the review of nursing at Cloverhill Prison enhances our resource allocation in that institution and is wholly appropriate in the context of demands in the prison during the night shift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#B00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed, and nurses are going to be very disappointed.

Not many nurses would apply for such posts, but I will bring back the Minister's response to the nursing members at Cloverhill and we will engage with the unions to consider what further action should be taken.

It has been over two years since a tenant purchase scheme was brought back to local authorities to enable tenants to purchase their homes.  I am very disappointed in this.<\/p> <p>How can people apply?  There are six conditions, but three are very serious and need to be addressed urgently.  One must have an annual income of at least &euro;15,000 and must not have bought a house under an earlier tenant purchase scheme, but there are special circumstances which should be addressed in the case of this latter condition.  The last condition is that a tenant must have paid his or her water charges.  I must express my disappointment at the fact that tenants on long-term social welfare are now excluded and not eligible to purchase their houses.  Old age pensioners who have worked all their lives and received their redundancy payments are being told by the local authority that they cannot purchase their houses under the new tenant purchase scheme for 2016.<\/p> <p>I know of a family which came into money and went to the local authority seeking to buy their house but were told they could not do so.  If somebody wins money, is left money or gets redundancy, he or she cannot purchase the house, and that is absolutely unfair.  The exclusion of Part V properties from the scheme may discriminate against tenants allocated such dwellings, and this is discrimination against people on social welfare who want to buy their houses.  The provision in Circular 44\/2015, which excludes local authorities from completing the sale of properties to tenants with outstanding water charges, is also unfair.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to look at the new tenant purchase scheme.  It has been two and a half years since there was a tenant purchase scheme in any local authority, and now this scheme has come in, but it takes us backwards instead of forwards.  I welcome the scheme, but the three issues I have raised need to be urgently examined and changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#B00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.

It is six months old.  I spoke on this in the D&aacute;il last week and I agreed that we needed to review it, but not six months into it.  Our intention is to review it 12 months after it came into operation, which will be next January.  The scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  They must have been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year and have been allocated a house under a local authority allocation scheme.  Similarly to other incremental purchase model schemes currently operating, the scheme involves progressive discounts for purchasers linked to household income, ranging from 40% to 60% depending on income, with the housing authority placing an incremental charge on the house equivalent to the discount given, and this will stay in place for 20, 25 or 30 years.  The Senator knocks the scheme, but I think it is a very attractive scheme and there is a good offer in comparison to other schemes for those who fit the criteria.  It is based on income, rather than number of years a person has been in the house, but I agree that it is not a perfect scheme and that there are parts we need to change.<\/p> <p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in line with ministerial directions.  It can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions and maintenance payments.  The reckonable income can also include most social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  The Senator raised this issue and we need to look at it.  If people are reliant on disability benefit or allowance they will be probably be reliant on it for the next number of years, and I have a difficulty with their being precluded from buying a house.  We do need to look at the criteria to see if we can accommodate this and change it to allow for them to qualify, bearing in mind that a person who purchases a house has the responsibility for maintaining the house, insuring it and paying all the various charges, including water charges if they come back.  There are costs after one buys a house, and just because somebody has a windfall it does not guarantee that they can run the house thereafter.  That is an issue we must examine.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I accept the Senator's point.  If someone wins a decent amount of money, he or she should be in a position to buy a house that has been the family home for a long time.  That is something we should be able to allow for as well.  We will examine the matter.  I have an open mind in terms of examining all the criteria and reviewing the position.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the income of all the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner or cohabitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them.<\/p><p>It is essential that the income of an applicant under the scheme is of a long-term and sustainable nature, which goes back to the point I made.  Having a lump sum of money is not always enough.  That is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring ownership of and responsibility for the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p><p>The new tenant (incremental) purchase scheme is in the early stages of implementation - the first six months - and my Department is monitoring the operation of the scheme in consultation with housing authorities.  I gave a commitment to the Senator's colleague Deputy Barry Cowen and others during the D&aacute;il debate that we will engage on the issue.  We will talk to anyone who is interested.  I am open to all ideas on criteria.  We will analyse all the ideas with a view to making changes, if need be, from next year on.<\/p><p>In line with the commitment in the new programme for a partnership Government, a review of the 2016 scheme will be undertaken following its first 12 months of operation.  Any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme that are considered necessary will be introduced based on the evidence gathered at that stage.  I hope that provides clarity on the issue for Senator Murnane O'Connor.<\/p><p>The matter of Part V properties was previously raised.  There is a logic behind not allowing Part V houses to be sold.  The aim of the scheme is to provide for a mix of housing in a given area, and if we sell those houses we lose the opportunity to have a social mix, which is the intention.  The scheme is designed that way for a reason.  If we sell all the houses built under Part V then the aims of the scheme could be compromised.  There is logic behind the approach taken.  I am happy to tease out the matter.  I accept the reasoning behind the Senator's suggestion but there is a logic to the approach being taken in not allowing Part V houses to be sold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#B00700","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>To clarify, the scheme was introduced in January and the local authority in Carlow only sent out the forms in March, so in my eyes the period in question for the scheme to be examined was only three months.

From what the Minister of State said, everything must be addressed, including the desire of people with disabilities and people on local authority waiting lists to buy their houses, but we must also make sure that people are given the chance to get a home.

The community in the midlands rallied and Console was very quickly inundated with people's generosity.  Vast numbers of people in the midlands came on board; tradespeople and business people gave of their time, trade and money.  Business people in the town and the wider area provided fixtures, fittings and furniture for the centre.  At the time Paul Kelly said the community had really taken ownership of this project and thanks to their incredible efforts they were able to offer hope and help to people in the midlands who were struggling with mental health issues or suicide.  The centre even included a Donal room for teenagers.  Donal Walsh is a young boy who died from cancer and who used the last months of his life to talk to people about the preciousness of life and appeal to young people not to take their own lives.  His family helped to fund the Donal room in the Athlone centre.  It was a significant achievement for them to do that in memory of their son.<\/p> <p>When people are affected by the suicide of a loved one, they feel abandoned.  They have many unanswered questions.  For many, counselling is a lifeline.  It offers a safe haven to try to make sense of life's rupture, a place to learn to trust again and perhaps a place of hope.  The CEO of Console took that away.  The goodwill of people was abused.  He broke the trust of some of the most vulnerable people in Ireland.  Some of the therapists who work in the centres have not been paid in more than two months but, because they recognise the supreme importance of the work they do, they have continued to work with their clients so as not to abandon them again or break their trust again, and in order not to reawaken the trauma they have been through.<\/p> <p>We must ask why this happened.  The Console catastrophe points to a much deeper problem in the Government and in society.

Its counsellors and therapists are experienced in addressing trauma, loss, crisis intervention and complicated grief.<\/p> <p>The HSE audit into Console was initiated in April 2015 by the National Office for Suicide Prevention following an examination of the 2013 returns from Console to the HSE, which were received in late 2014.  The HSE has confirmed that concerns arose in a number of areas, including the corporate governance and financial management of the agency.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It should be noted that the HSE has informed the Department of Health that it has not uncovered any issues with the standard of the services funded through the executive.  As the Senator has pointed out, much of the work that went on in her office is completely separate to the issues that have arisen.  The audit process has been concluded and an audit report has been sent to the HSE's mental health division.  The Minister and I were briefed by the latter on 4 July 2016 in respect of the HSE's audit of Console.  At this meeting, we both emphasised that the continuation of services was an overriding priority.  We were informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been provided with a copy of the audit report and that the Committee of Public Accounts will also be provided with a copy ahead of its meeting on 15 July.  The Minister updated the Cabinet on these developments on 5 July.<\/p><p>On 7 July, a series of meetings involving the HSE, the Department of Health, ministerial advisers, the charities regulator, service providers and the interim CEO of Console, David Hall, took place.  The purpose of the meetings was to clarify the current position with regard to Console and to consider how arrangements could be put in place to ensure the seamless continuation of the three services funded by the HSE and currently provided by Console, namely, the 24\/7 suicide helpline, which is possibly the most critical, the suicide bereavement liaison service, and the suicide bereavement counselling service.  The Minister and I met Console's interim CEO on 8 July and, since then, a lot of work has been done to ensure that the services provided by Console are continued.  HSE management has assured the Department of Health that its first priority will be to ensure continuity of the various services provided by Console, having equal regard to the financial controls and the guidelines around the funding of agencies by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#C00800","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>What is really important here is the phrase \"seamless continuation of the three services\", which the Minister of State used.  I welcome this because that continuation needs to be seamless.  What if these centres do not continue as they are at present?  What will happen to them, who will own them and what will happen in the context of the work that has been done?  People who gave of their time, money and expertise not be discouraged from doing so because of the greed of people such as the former CEO of Console?  When the Minister of State examines this matter, I urge her to look at these centres and the amount of money, time and general goodwill that has been invested in them and ensure that they are not just shut down.  I also urge her to look at the number of different groups that are looking after the same area.  We need a more consolidated approach to this matter.  It should not be a case of people just setting up different charities throughout the country, there is a need for the Government to adopt a national holistic approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#D00200","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The Senator will understand that there are certain elements of this that I cannot discuss at present but I hope that we will have a resolution and that the details will become more public in the coming days and weeks.

It is also extremely important that there is continuous work with those who have provided the counselling service within Console and that they do not feel abandoned.  A great deal of work has gone into ensuring that they are engaged with and that they know what is happening throughout this process.<\/p> <p>Most importantly, in the aftermath of this saga we must ensure that the charities sector is properly regulated.  During the debate in the D&aacute;il last evening, I very much welcomed the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality's move to commence section 4 of the Act.  I welcome the additional funding that will allow these acts to take place with additional staff and funding.  In particular, we need to look at section 38 and 39 agencies so a review is under way of the 40 charities that are currently funded through section 38.

I very much appreciate it in light of her responsibility for mental health.  I know it is an individual case and that people in her position do not like discussing such cases.  However, this is a particular case and I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise it today.  It concerns Igor Baker, whose father is in the Public Gallery.  We are talking about a young man who has been tragically let down by the State since he arrived in Ireland.  He was misdiagnosed at the age of 13 as having schizophrenia but he never had the condition.  This young man suffers from autism and has basically been residing at the Ashlin Centre in Beaumont Hospital since 30 September 2015.  He has violent tendencies and his parents cannot care for him adequately in the family home.  Beaumont Hospital realised this, as did every doctor who came into contact with the family.  The Minister of State will know that sometimes one comes across these cases where a family is looking for a place.  There is a residential unit somewhere and the family wants to either obtain a place or get onto the list for a place.  We do our best in those individual circumstances.  What strikes me about this case, which is the reason I am raising it, is that everybody involved accepts that this young man cannot live at home.  His parents have done their best for him.  The Ashlin Centre admitted this young man on 30 September 2015 and he still lives there voluntarily.  If he were to walk out onto the street tomorrow morning, there is nothing the hospital or the centre could do stop him.<\/p> <p>There is a place for this young man at the newest centre in Kildare, so the issue appears to be funding.  That the State, through the Ashlin Centre, is keeping this young man does not make any sense.  Why can this funding not be used to give him some chance in a much more appropriate setting at the newest centre?  There seems to be a well-meaning conspiracy of convenience here.  Everybody knows what needs to be done and that what this young man is going through is not appropriate for his needs.  English is not his first language.  He needs a sustainable, long-term care plan.  I do not know how the other people who live at the newest centre got in there in the first instance.  Obviously, they have situations that are similar to that of Igor Baker but funding was acquired to allow them to live at that centre.  I cannot think of any case in my political career where everybody agrees what should happen but there seems to be a blockage somewhere.  What is it that has permitted the State to allow Igor to remain in Beaumont Hospital, effectively on a day-to-day basis, since 30 September 2015 but that does not allow it to give him, his family and the people who love him the opportunity to access long-term care in a setting that is appropriate to his needs?  Obviously, the answer is money but why are we spending so much money to keep him in Beaumont Hospital instead of giving him the chance he needs to live the life he deserves to live in this country surrounded by people who can care for him appropriately and satisfy his family that he is being cared for appropriately?  <\/p> <p>I know that departmental officials will say that it is an individual case and that they do not like discussing such cases.  However, I think the Minister of State will agree that this is a particularly unusual one.  The Baker family are private people who do not necessarily want their private matters discussed on the airwaves.  They appeared on the Claire Byrne show a number of months ago when the case was discussed.  They do not necessarily want this case raised on the floor of the Seanad, the D&aacute;il or anywhere else.  They just want a solution.  I appeal to the Minister of State to agree with me that what has been done with this young man is inappropriate and we need to find a more appropriate and sustainable solution for him and his family.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#D00500","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I welcome Mr. Baker to the Public Gallery.<\/p> <p>One of the key aims of the Government is to provide services and supports for people with disabilities.  The aim is to empower them to live their own lives, as the Senator rightly put it, and provide them with greater independence so that they can access services, choose to live their lives how they want to and tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the programme for a partnership Government, which is guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life of people with disabilities.

The Estimates were only voted on last week, so we are still waiting to see where that funding will go.<\/p><p>Mr. Baker has a lengthy history of engagement with both child and adolescent and adult mental health services and the Senator might disagree but I have been informed that he has received extensive input and support from the wider multidisciplinary team, which includes home care support, community mental health nurse input, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and social work services.  In addition, Mr. Baker has been funded through the disability services for attendance on an outreach basis with the provider Gheel Autism Services, which provides a varied range of services, including day and residential services.  He has also been admitted to the north Dublin mental health services acute psychiatric unit, among various things that have happened.<\/p><p>As Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has pointed out, it is the view of the clinicians involved in Mr. Baker's care that a placement with a private residential care provider, Nua Health Care services, Fethard, County Tipperary, is best placed to meet his needs.  The HSE has been in ongoing communications with the family in regard to the funding arrangement for a private placement for Mr Baker.  While resources are not infinite in terms of the expenditure incurred in the provision of private placements, all cases are considered on an individual basis and prioritised based on overall clinical need and available financial resources.  As Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has pointed out, all the clinicians have established that the need is there but the finance is still a problem.<\/p><p>Dublin north city and county community health organisation is working proactively with HSE national mental health services to identify the funding arrangements required for this placement and will continue to keep the family informed.  I stress that the idea is that we all live in a world where everybody has equal opportunity and should be able to avail of the services we need, irrespective of how much it costs.  The Senator has hit the nail on the head: to be crude, it would probably cost much less for Mr. Baker to be in the service he needs to be in, given the amount being spent on where he is now, but the problem is with the fluidity of the funding we have within the Department of Health.  There is no fluidity of funding between the different sections within the Department and that is something that needs a great deal of work.  It requires a ten-year plan and is something we have started to put in place.<\/p><p>In the interim, I would be happy to meet with Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and to raise this issue with my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for disability issues, Deputy McGrath.  That funding was only voted through in the Estimates last week and it will take time to see where exactly it is going to go but if we can source funding somehow, I will certainly help in whatever way I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#D00600","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State's comments and her offer to meet with me and, I hope, with the family as well will be well received.

His family cannot care for him in the family home.  He is a strong young man.  He is 23 years of age and he has a history of violent outbursts.  His parents are at the end of their tether in this regard.

Since then, the cost of going back to school has increased by almost &euro;300 for primary school children and by almost &euro;500 for secondary school children.  However, schools can do more in that regard, particularly in light of the survey's finding that eight out of ten parents must make a \"voluntary\" contribution.  The idea that schools are doing enough is not true, but the Government must do more, as many parents feel under pressure.  Fourteen per cent of parents do not go to a credit union for that money; they go to moneylenders.  That is something we have to stop.  It is the very reason John Hume set up the credit union in Derry, and it was set up in Dublin in light of the shocking number of people in poverty who were being driven further into poverty by resorting to moneylenders to cover costs such as back-to-school costs.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on that specific issue because when it costs &euro;1,500 to send a child back to school, it makes a mockery of the issue of free education.<\/p> <p>The Leader might clarify the position on an issue we discussed yesterday, namely, the closure of accident and emergency wards.  He said that the Minister did not commission a report and that the report was not presented to him.  He mentioned the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland doing a report, which is correct, but that was a year ago.  In a reply to our spokesperson for health in the D&aacute;il on 10 November last year, the then Minister for Health stated that his Department, in consultation with the HSE, was developing a policy on trauma networks for Ireland and that a steering group, which he had appointed, was currently in the process of developing this policy.  That is not a report; it is a policy, and there is a big difference.  As I pointed out yesterday, in 20 years of reports commissioned by government departments in England, not once did the report differ from the Government's policy.  The policy that is being developed with regard to the closing down the Mullingar and eight other accident and emergency departments is of serious concern.  I ask the Leader to clarify the position on that for the House.  At the Irish Hospital Consultants Association conference in October 2015, the Minister stated, with regard to policy on trauma services, that there is international evidence that there are many benefits to organising trauma on a national basis, and he reiterated that he had set up a trauma steering group.  That is the report we are concerned about.  That is the one that refers to closing down all the accident and emergency departments.

I spoke last week on the alcohol problem in the State and I feel that I have to bring it up again.<\/p> <p>After some research I was shocked to see the findings.  Figures in the Health Research Board&rsquo;s national alcohol diary survey show the following: over 150,000 people in Ireland are dependent drinkers; more than a 1.35 million people are harmful drinkers; and 30% of people who were interviewed said they experienced some form of harm as a result of their own drinking.  The report also revealed that 75% of alcohol consumed is done as part of binge drinking and that people underestimate the amount they drink by about 60%.<\/p> <p>I shall provide further facts, which I hope is okay with Senators, because they provide shocking figures.  There are 88 deaths every month in Ireland directly attributable to alcohol.  This is three people per day who die from an alcohol-related illness in this wonderful country of ours.  One in four deaths of young men aged 15 to 39 in Ireland is due to alcohol.  There are almost twice as many deaths due to alcohol in Ireland as are due to all other drugs combined.  Alcohol was implicated in 137, one in three, of all poisoning deaths in 2013, more than any other single drug.  Alcohol poisoning has claimed one life each week.  Some 900 people are diagnosed with alcohol-related cancers and nearly 500 people die from these diseases every year.<\/p> <p>Alcohol is a factor in half of all suicides in Ireland.  Alcohol is also involved in over one third of cases of deliberate self-harm, peaking around weekends and public holidays.  Alcohol is a factor in one third of all drownings in Ireland.  In 2011, over 14,000 people were admitted to the liver unit in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital for the treatment of alcohol dependence.  Every day, 1,500 beds in our hospitals are occupied by people with alcohol-related problems.  Alcohol-related illness cost the health care system &euro;800 million in 2013.  These are scary and shocking figures.<\/p> <p>The question must be asked, how much is too much?

However, 58% of people think not enough is being done.  It is scary.  Some 78% believe that the Government has a responsibility to implement public health measures to address high levels of alcohol consumption.<\/p> <p>These are just a few of the stark figures from the Health Research Board&rsquo;s report on alcohol harm.

The message from the report, which I understand is to be released later today, is that younger people face very tough times in modern Ireland compared with their older counterparts.  We all know the reasons for this are varied but one glaring and obvious factor in young people's experiences today is their particular exposure to precarious working hours and low pay.  In order to close the income gap and the generation gap we must move our national minimum wage, responsibly and over a period of time, towards a national living wage.<\/p><p>This week the living wage technical group - an independent expert body - calculated the national living wage to be &euro;11.50 per hour for a single worker.  This compares with the Government's frankly miserable ambition for the national minimum wage to reach approximately &euro;10.50 per hour over a five-year period.  Next week the Low Pay Commission, which was established last year, will issue its second report on the national minimum wage rate and issue a recommendation to Government about the rate of the national minimum wage for 2017.  This will be the Government's first test regarding assisting those on low pay.<\/p><p>We have heard statements from a range of Ministers and individuals from the Independent Alliance, which comprises part of this Government, that their ambition is to see a national living wage.  However, the reality is that those very same Ministers signed up to a programme for Government that insists the minimum wage will only reach &euro;10.50 per hour over the next five years.<\/p><p>The national living wage is currently a voluntary initiative and a considerable number of employers have adopted the rate of &euro;11.50 per hour.  There are certain workers in the State who are employed by the Government and its agencies who do not receive what could be described as a living wage.  If the Government is ambitious enough, it is within its remit to ensure that young workers coming into the Civil Service and public service are paid a national living wage.

There is great concern about the inversion deals and companies, as has been alluded to, using Ireland as a base for tax reasons only.  I know there has been some limitation in America to try to stop some of these inversion deals but the figures are really mind-boggling.  They tell us that we have 26.3% growth.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, said yesterday that the real growth was closer to 7%.  If that is the case, 80% of that growth, or four fifths of our economy, is a false economy.  As has been outlined, the main reason for that are the aviation and leasing companies operating out of Ireland.  It would be brilliant if they were providing some jobs.  However, the serious problem I have is that about two weeks ago, a leading aviation expert said in one of the national papers that 1,000 jobs are directly contributed by the newly-formed aviation leasing companies in our country and that another 1,000 jobs are associated with that.  It is 80% of our GDP and we have gotten only 2,000 jobs out of it.  The tax figure is minuscule, or so they are telling us at present.  That is nobody's fault and nobody is doing anything wrong in that regard.  They are bulking up on stock and whatever else.  However, we are not seeing any benefit to the real economy.<\/p> <p>Our corporation tax has been a huge help to the country.  It has certainly been a great help in bringing jobs and growth to the country.  However, this is something that we will have to look at.  Whether it is a minimum tax rate related to the turnover of these companies or something else, a mechanism will have to be put in place to ensure that this sector gives real help to the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#J00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I echo the sentiments of my learned friend across the Chamber about the Minister for Education and Skills coming to the House, especially with families coping with children going back to school soon.  I was on the education committee from 2011 to 2016 and we produced a report on school donations from parents with children going back to school, which is a huge issue.  Certain schools say that if parents do not give &euro;100 or &euro;150, the student will not get a locker key or will not be allowed to do arts or computer studies.  What happens then is that we have bullying in schools.  Children are left with their schoolbags on their backs for the day because they do not have a locker key.  The Department of Education and Skills has said that this should not be happening and that it is totally wrong.<\/p> <p>I want the Minister to come to the House to tell us that he will write to schools to tell them that this practice is outdated and should be done away with.  I have no problem with any school fundraising if it needs something.  That is not a problem at all.  However, at a time when children are going back to school, when parents with three or four children have already bought school books and uniforms, it is an absolute disgrace that the school is looking for &euro;100 or &euro;150 extra per head.  One particular school now sends parents a statement.  If a parent is paying say &euro;25 or &euro;50 each month, the school sends out a statement on the donation.  We need to get rid of this practice.  It is draconian and it leads to bullying in schools.<\/p> <p>I want the Minister to come to the House and to write to all the schools in the country engaged in this practice.  I know for a fact that in certain schools, there are separate accounts into which this money goes.  It is kept in separate accounts.  I asked this question at the education committee.  Do the Minister and the Department know what is in these accounts and where this money goes?  There is one account for the school and another account for fundraising.  Let us have the Minister come to the House to explain the whole situation.  I want this practice to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#J00300","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Maidin mhaith duit, a Chathaoirligh.

Hopefully, the Cathaoirleach will indulge me if I say a few quick words to commend the people responsible for ensuring that yesterday's 12 July events in the North passed off, by and large, without any major incident.  That is down to a tremendous amount of work by community and political leaders, the PSNI, statutory agencies and officials from both Governments who are working very hard on the ground.  I believe the Seanad can play a positive role in trying to show leadership and provide assistance and support to the Department of Foreign Affairs officials and to local communities who look to Dublin for leadership and support at some of these more challenging times.  I ask the Leader, once the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is formed, if this is something that committee can consider in advance of next summer.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is a very positive one, which is important to me.  I indicated very early on in this Seanad that I would be bringing this issue to the floor of the House and working on it as vigorously as I possibly could.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, announced yesterday that a referendum would be held next year to consider giving voting rights in Presidential elections to the Irish diaspora.  I believe that is a very welcome and positive move.  It is only right and proper that we enfranchise our Irish citizens who are living around the world and who have a very close affinity with home.  As Senators know, the President is the President of Ireland and of the Irish people.  I believe it is important that we all have the opportunity as Irish citizens to be enfranchised and to exercise our vote.  It was something that was supported by the Constitutional Convention in terms of extending voting rights to Irish citizens not just in the diaspora but even closer to home in the North.  Out of interest, I took a photograph of the inside of my passport, which, of course, is an Irish one and it states: \"It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish Nation.\"  I think it is past time that we worked to ensure that becomes the case and that all Irish citizens across this island have a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#J00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I have two items to raise.

Only yesterday, three members of An Garda were hospitalised in Portlaoise regional hospital after the patrol vehicle they were driving was rammed by a stolen 4x4 with three occupants on board.  The three men were subsequently arrested after failing to stop.  It was part of a Garda operation on rural crime in the midland area of our country.  It highlights again the dangerous job that members of An Garda do on behalf of us all on a daily basis.

I find that very disappointing.  We must stand up to Europe on the issue because Ireland is a unique and special case and different from other countries in Europe as it is the only one with a land border between Europe and the UK.  Chancellor Merkel and the rest of Europe must wake up to the fact that Ireland is a special case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#J00600","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I raise a problem that I am particularly aware of in my home town of Ballina relating to the installation of meters by GMC-Sierra on behalf of Irish Water.  In a number of cases, the contractor - GMC-Sierra and its agent - went to install the meter and switched the water back on after the installation.  A problem arose in unoccupied houses or some that were being renovated, as the houses have flooded.  This happened in March 2014, when the job was undertaken in Ballina.  I am aware that it took approximately three months for an assessor to inspect the problem.  The issue went from GMC-Sierra to Irish Water to an insurance company.  To my shock, I am told the house I describe and ten others - 11 houses in total - still have not been sorted out and the owners have not been compensated for the damage.  I saw a rented house recently where the water had been switched off because of a leak in a pipe to a hot water tank.  When GMC-Sierra workers switched on the water, the house flooded.  It was reported at the time.<\/p> <p>Ballina and surrounding areas in Mayo, along with other parts of the country, were among the first to get water meters.  I wonder how widespread is the issue.  Is it really acceptable that it has taken this long for Irish Water and GMC-Sierra to look after people with rented properties who have not been able to take in rental income?  I ask the appropriate Minister to investigate this so we can get some answers.  Is this the way business is to be done?  Will the insurance company or Irish Water cover the cost?  What is the policy with the installation of these water meters?  This is a real problem for several house owners in my town and it may be even more widespread, particularly in some of the areas where the water meters were first installed.  It is not good enough for this to be the position after more than two years.  This is not the way people should be dealt with.  These people were required to register for water and pay water charges but they now have had to cough up to fix their houses.

Importantly, it outlined the layers of discrimination and vulnerability faced by victims and survivors of sexual violence coming forward to tell their stories.  All victims face those barriers but this is diligently recorded information.

That is a very emotional issue and it is very understandable that this should happen, although it is unrealistic.  The next thing is having somebody walking in front of a car with a red flag.

I draw the House's attention to the comments made in recent days by Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, relating to homeless children.  His comments echo the sentiments raised in the House with the Fianna F&aacute;il motion a number of weeks ago that was unanimously passed by the House.  Dr. Muldoon has indicated that bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation are not suitable to support normal family living.  He argues that urgent action is needed to provide alternative accommodation for families that have become homeless.

The new housing action plan must make it clear that bed and breakfast accommodation and hotel accommodation is a measure of last resort for children and their families.  The new plan should ensure that no child is subjected to degrading or humiliating experiences as a result of being homeless.  If a family is to stay in emergency accommodation for a short period there should be no question of them using service entrances or being forced to eat in separate areas.  My last point is very valid.  The State pays for this accommodation.  Therefore, the people who avail of this accommodation are being hosted by the State and should be treated as equal citizens.  The State should make it clear to hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation that the people who stay in them should be treated no different from anybody else.

It is well known that there is a serious shortage in the hospitality sector and it is not just in my own county of Kerry.  I have picked it up around the place.  Chefs are reportedly very volatile people and it is very hard to hold onto them at the best of times, but it seems to be their market because there is such a shortage.  Bringing back CERT and that type of programme would be of use and I support Senator Mullen in that regard.<\/p> <p>I am not sure whether the Leader has ever attended a humanist ceremony, but such ceremonies, particularly weddings and funerals, even though a minority thing, are of growing interest, especially to people who may not have any religious beliefs and who wish to have either their marriages or funerals attended by proper and appropriate services.  These humanist celebrants are selected and trained to perform their duties in a professional and sensitive manner.  Their fees are in the order of about &euro;470 per ceremony, but unfortunately of late the Revenue Commissioners have decided that VAT is payable on the fees, at a rate of 23%.  These humanists celebrants have to register for VAT and it adds to the cost of the celebration.

It cost &euro;1,090 for a child to go back to secondary school in 2012, while it now costs &euro;1,474.  To know that parents have cut back on food is frightening.  As I have said to the Minister, last year in Carlow, like in many other places, we opened up what we call the soup kitchen, St. Clare's Hospitality.  I came to the Minister and went down every avenue I could to get funding for that soup kitchen and for food parcels.  We were told there is no streamlined funding for any help towards soup kitchens.  In this day and age, when children are hungry and we are in the summer, parents are now cutting down on food to buy uniforms.  It is an absolute disgrace that we are living in a society where children are now going to soup kitchens to be fed.  I ask the Minister to make sure there is streamlined funding for soup kitchens and that these parents get help towards school uniforms.  It is an absolute disgrace, in 2016, that we are going backwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#M00800","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I apologise to Senator Mulherin.  I missed her by mistake yesterday in my reply to the Order of Business.  She raised the issue of food waste, which, as she rightly said, is a very important social and environmental issue.  In her remarks yesterday, she referred to the fact that 60% of the waste we use is food waste.  It is important that we have a debate on that and I welcome her raising the issue yesterday.<\/p> <p>In respect of the point raised by Senators Daly and Wilson on the trauma network, there might be a bit of confusion.  There may be two reports.  Emanating from the RCSI AGM, the Minister accepted the need for a trauma report in terms of the best outcome for patients in a national strategy.  Let us make it clear again, so that we will not stoke fear, as has been done since the commentary at the weekend.  The Minister has committed to coming to the House and having a debate when the report is published.  He has not got a due date for the report yet. He is committed to coming in here.  He is not looking to close or remove trauma services from any hospital and there are no plans to do so.  If the Senators want to have a debate on reconfiguration, we can have that, but in the context of trauma and the patient, those involved in that medical specialty believe a trauma patient needs to be able to access the best care service, to have the right resources at the right level to match their own critical needs and to be seen to in the shortest time possible.  There is also an underlying need to develop a national trauma policy on what are called trauma networks.  In doing that, the report is seeking to put together a national strategy whereby there can be a national clinical programme for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and for those who work in that area.  To reiterate, the Minister does not have the plan or the report and he does not have any plans to close or remove trauma services.  He is willing to come to the House to debate the issue when the report comes.  He cannot be any fairer than that.  I hope that has clarified matters for the Senators.<\/p> <p>In regard to the issue raised by Senators McDowell, Conway-Walsh, Feighan, O'Donnell, and Daly regarding our growth rate, I note the remarks in the House today.  I also note the remarks by commentators and by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, but I will point to the statement issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and by the Minister for Finance that the Government will present to the Lower House in October a budget based on sensible growth figures, not on the figures we saw yesterday.  It is fair to point out, however, that we do have a situation emerging in our country where there is growth, where unemployment is decreasing, and where, as Senator O'Donnell rightly said, consumer spending is on the up.  We will see a sensible approach to the budget.  In saying that, it is imperative to understand that our economy today is in a much better position than it was seven years ago.  The economy is growing and more people are back at work.  We will have discussions in the House tomorrow regarding the summer economic statement.  While our growth levels are improving, nobody is taking the figures presented yesterday as indicating that we should be going off the charts in terms of public expenditure.  It is important to understand that our economy is in a better place and we have seen an improvement in the health of the nation economically.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I note former Senator Mary Henry has just left the Chamber.  I would like to acknowledge her presence earlier in the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>In regard to education, the soaring cost of preparing children for their return to school is an issue of huge concern and a source of worry.  The Minister made reference in his speech yesterday to the increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which is now payable at the rate of &euro;100 in respect of children between the ages of 4 and 11 and &euro;200 in respect of children between the ages of 12 and 22.  While these are small amounts in terms of the overall cost for families, it should be noted that overall &euro;38.8 million is being made available for the scheme this year which, at its core, is designed to help people meet back to school costs.  Any measures that can be put in place at a local level or otherwise in terms of uniform and textbook costs must be considered.  <\/p><p>I know from a discussion I had recently with my sister-in-law that she spent &euro;250 on copies and hardback books alone for my nephews and nieces return to school.  It is important to put on the record that the former Minister for Education and Skills, Mr. Quinn, put in place an agreement with the Irish Educational Publishers Association in regard to textbook costs.  All of us who have been involved in education recognise the importance of book rental schemes and the significant amounts of money that can be saved by families in that regard.  The Minister is acutely conscious of back to school costs.  While he does not have powers in regard to the regulation of school uniforms, it is important that we require schools to be sensible in terms of their demands of parents and pupils in that regard.  The point made by Senator Butler in regard to bullying is one that we would never want to countenance.<\/p><p>In regard to voluntary contributions, having been in education for almost 20, from my perspective, there is no compulsion to pay.  I would be appalled at schools publishing a list of payments and non-payments by parents.  That should not be tolerated.  There should be no publication of such lists.  School principals and boards of management should provide for exemptions in respect of the voluntary contribution.  There is an onus on the boards of management of schools to work with parents in regard to how they help meet the needs of the school community.<\/p><p>Senators Conway-Walsh and Feighan raised the issue of the appointment later today of Theresa May, MP, as the new UK Prime Minister.  I wish her well today as she takes up her post.  Prime Minister Cameron is, as we speak, taking his final round of Prime Minister's questions in the House of Commons.  It is important that, as a House, we congratulate and pay tribute to him for his stewardship during his tenure as Prime Minister, in particular in regard to the increased co-operation we have seen between North and South and Ireland and the UK.  I hope that this will continue during the tenure of the new Prime Minister, Theresa May.<\/p><p>Senator Black again raised the issue of the misuse of alcohol and alcohol services.  The public health (alcohol) Bill will be before the House soon, at which time we can debate the issue.  It is important we continue to work on that issue.  I commend Senator Black on her work in the area of the misuse of alcohol.  <\/p><p>Senator Nash raised the issue of the problems faced by young people as highlighted in the departmental report published today.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on the Low Pay Commission report when it has been published.<\/p><p>Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of the 12th of July events held yesterday.  We all welcome that there was no major outbreak of sectarianism, other than that about which we spoke yesterday, and that there were no major casualties or injuries.  I hope that we can continue to build bridges such that we can allow for celebrations to be held in a dignified, tolerant and respectful manner.  On the issue of voting for immigrants, I will be happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, come to the House for a debate in that regard.  Senator O'Donnell raised the issue of the Limerick City of Culture.  As I said yesterday, I wish everyone involved well in that regard.  <\/p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the important issue of assaults on garda&iacute;.  We can never allow a situation to develop whereby members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are disrespected.  All of us condemn unreservedly any attack on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is hoped that everybody in positions of influence in communities in all parts of the country will work to ensure that our garda&iacute; are respected.  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of water meter installation in Ballina.  I suggest that the Senator take up that issue with the Minister by way of a Commencement matter.  <\/p><p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of the commissioned report on LGBT victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence.  There is an inordinate ten-year wait in this area, which is unacceptable.  I commend those involved in producing the report and thank Senator Warfield for raising the matter.  We must strive to ensure that those who feel vulnerable or are victims of abuse or violence can overcome such awful events in their lives and that barriers are removed so that they become more accepted within society.  We must work to improve the lot of all our people.<\/p><p>Senator Norris again raised the issue of transport in Dublin.  I am happy to work with him in providing such a debate.  Like Senator Clifford-Lee, I believe the Luas and DART are important parts of our public transport system and rather than say they are useless services, we should work to ensure increased utilisation of them.<\/p><p>Senator Clifford-Lee also spoke about the housing action plan and the important point made in regard to the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon.  I agree with the Senator and Dr. Muldoon that hotel rooms and bed and breakfast facilities are not suitable accommodation for young children or families.  The Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Coveney, will present his housing action plan in the coming weeks and we can discuss that point during the debate on it in this House.  <\/p><p>Senator Conway raised the issue power surges.  I will be happy to take up that matter with Electric Ireland.  The Senator also raised the issue of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Cathaoirleach is correct that this House does not have any remit in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts but is important that the points made by Senator Conway are taken on board.  Perhaps we can write to the committee in that regard.<\/p><p>Senators Mullen and Ned O'Sullivan raised the important issue of chefs and the deficit in regard to staff in our hospitality sector.  This is the by-product of a decision by a previous Administration, during which time Senator Mullen and I were last Members of the Seanad, which has resulted in a lack of training and expertise in this area and the recruitment of staff from abroad.  Thankfully, the Ministers of State, Deputy English and Deputy Halligan, are addressing this issue via the future skills need programme.  I hope that we will see an improvement in the situation soon.  The Senators are right to raise that important issue.  Ireland is the island of cead m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  Our tourism sector is growing exponentially and it is critical that our service is being provided at expert level and that we have trained chefs and other staff required by the service industry.  I thank the Senators for raising that issue.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of bins.  We will revert to that matter.  In regard to debates, because of the need for have legislation passed, some of the debates requested and agreed to have had to be postponed.  These debates have been placed on the list for the autumn session.  I assure the Senators they have not been forgotten.  In regard to the case mentioned by the Senator, I am not familiar with it.  If the Senator outlines it to me following the Order of Business, I will raise it with the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke called for a debate on Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade funding for the International Development Association, IDA.  I am happy to provide for such a debate.<\/p><p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of Humanist ceremonies.  It is important VAT is paid.  It is also important we have transparency in regard to the payment for services being provided to all people, whether they are getting married or being buried, and that everybody pays their taxes.  Those of us have attended Humanist ceremonies recognise the importance of them.  I will be happy to work with the Senator on how we can address any imbalances in that area.<\/p><p>Senator Murnane-O'Connor raised the issue of funding for social protection schemes.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on that issue.  I am also happy to accept the Bill, as amended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#M00900","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Senator Clifford-Lee has moved the following amendment to the Order of Business, \"That No. 11 be taken before No. 1.\"  Is the Leader accepting the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#N00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>He has accepted the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#N00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The Bill gives this House an historic opportunity to make history, to keep faith with the people and to restore their faith in our democracy, and to take the brave strides necessary to ensure that this House lives up to its intended constitutional potential in future.<\/p><p>I and my colleagues who introduced this Bill, to whom I am grateful for their support and co-operation, warmly welcome the strong support we have received from the Taoiseach and the Government, in whose programme the implementation of the Manning report is included, as well as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the other parties and groupings in the Oireachtas for the Bill&rsquo;s enactment.<\/p><p>This Stage of the Bill&rsquo;s consideration is concerned with the broad principles of the Bill.  When the debate is concluded, we can get down to a detailed consideration of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  I am sure very careful consideration will be given to the proposals for reform, to their phased implementation, perhaps, and to amendments to improve the Bill.  Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom, but that is no excuse for inaction.<\/p><p>At the outset, I think it is only fair to point out that while doubtless there are Senators who will not agree with every element of the Bill, it is equally true that this Seanad would certainly no longer exist if the people had been confronted at the time of the referendum with a simple choice to either abolish the Seanad or leave it totally unreformed.  There is a strong will among the people for reform of this House so that it can play an enhancing role in our democracy.  This House can become a forum for voices that have traditionally been marginalised and excluded from the democratic process because of the dynamic of multi-seat proportional representation in our representative politics.  There are national movements, national perspectives and community and voluntary interests that can never realistically aspire to winning D&aacute;il seats but that can and should be part of the  parliamentary process.  This Bill opens up the parliamentary system to their presence in Leinster House.<\/p><p>  The current method of electing 43 Members of the Seanad by an electorate of approximately 1,000 Deputies, Senators and councillors finds no specific basis in the Constitution.  The Oireachtas is given a constitutional blank canvas as to how Senators are to be elected.  The reform Bills tabled by former Senators Quinn, Zappone and Crown for the first time showed that it was possible to have the 43 vocational panel senators elected by ordinary citizens without amending the Constitution.<\/p><p>The Manning report is a compromise, based on consultation across the parties, between the principle of popular election and the current system.  Of the 43 panel seats, it proposes that 30 should be elected by citizens on a one-person-one-vote basis, while the remaining 13 seats should be elected by Deputies, Senators and councillors.  Under the Bill&rsquo;s proposals, any citizen will be eligible to register to vote in any vocational panel in the same way as certain university graduates can register to vote for the existing university seats.  In this way, people with, for example, a special interest in agriculture, fisheries and the natural environment could register as voters on the agriculture panel, people with an interest in voluntary social activity could register to vote on the administrative panel, and similarly in regard to education.  These electors could choose to elect national figures or campaigners active in their respective fields.  <\/p><p>If there are Members of this House who consider that the changes proposed in this Bill are too sudden, they can, of course, table amendments to phase in the changes.  However, I do not believe that there is any significant support in the Seanad or D&aacute;il or among the public for retaining the <i>status quo<\/i>.  By initiating this Bill in the Seanad, we can bring our collective experience and judgment to bear on its provisions, and then send it to the D&aacute;il for its consideration.  The alternative of having such a Bill sent to us by the D&aacute;il is, I think, less desirable. <\/p><p>I would like to add two further points.  This Bill is not intended to create an extra or rival D&aacute;il.  The Constitution never envisaged that this House could obstruct the democratic process or rival the D&aacute;il.  The proof of that is to be found in the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s constitutional power to override the Seanad after 90 days.  That provision simply would not be there if the Seanad was always envisaged to be a place where the Government of the day had to have a majority as a matter of electoral fact or by convention.  On the contrary, the power to override this House strongly suggests that the Seanad&rsquo;s composition was expected to be independent.  That is why, as part of the new politics, we should not fear a loosening of the tight grip of political parties over this House.  The compromise of the Manning report is designed to ensure that the composition of the Seanad reflects some party political presence and some degree of independence.<\/p><p>Senator Norris has voiced opposition to having a single university constituency, <i>inter alia<\/i>because he thinks such a constituency would become dominated by political parties.  The NUI electorate is very large, but has never succumbed to party dominance.  I do not believe that, 30 years after provision was made to widen the higher education franchise to other institutions such as the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, we can simply turn our backs on them on a cry of &ldquo;No surrender.&rdquo;  The constitutional amendment made by the people did not prescribe a single higher education constituency, and indeed it envisages dividing the seats among groups of those institutions and even giving individual seats to individual institutions.  Yet again, there is room for consideration on Committee Stage of alternatives other than a simple choice between leaving things as they are and having a single constituency for the university seats.  <\/p><p>In the brief time available to me, I will not have enough time to canvass the entirety of the content of the Bill.  I would like to point out to Members of the House that the Bill is accompanied by a very satisfactory explanatory memorandum which deals with the various issues contained in the Bill.  The Bill for the first time seems to have cross-party support, the support of the Government and the personal endorsement of the Taoiseach, and seems to be the first opportunity the House has had to advance the question of reform in the eyes of the people in a constructive way.<\/p><p>It is true that the Second Stage debate is largely one confined to the question of principle and not detail.  The principles laid down in the Manning report are, in my respectful view, ones which should commend themselves and attract support almost universally.  The idea that ordinary citizens interested in agriculture should be entitled to register for an agriculture panel vote, just as much as UCD graduates are entitled to register for the NUI panel and vote on it, is not a strange or frightening one.  Likewise, for those who believe that the current system, which to some extent connects the county council and local government structures with the Oireachtas, has merits, this is preserved in the balance struck by the Manning report.  In essence, he has acknowledged the idea that there should be a majority of popularly elected Senators based on the existing system of panels provided for in the Constitution, while at the same time preserving some aspects of the current system of indirect election via county councillors.<\/p><p>In that context, one thing occurred to me when I prepared my remarks for the debate.  A number of Ministers have come to the House in recent times and said that they are minded to enhance the role and support given to local authority members.  That is a good thing.  However, in the context of the Bill, we might consider whether the absolute ban on members of local authorities from being Members of the House is something that deserves to be reviewed.  I fully accept the proposition that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann chose, under the former Minister Noel Dempsey, to enact legislation to end what was called the dual mandate.  However, if there are to be indirectly elected members of the House under the terms and conditions mentioned in the Manning report, it seems a bit strange that somebody can be an elector while at the same time being disqualified from membership of the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As part of an overall package to recognise the role of local government and the link between local government and the Oireachtas generally, which has existed through the Seanad electoral system, we should be open minded about looking at those kind of issues.

I recognise and acknowledge the work that has been done in preparing this Bill.  There has been a huge amount of work done over the past number of years in preparing it.  I feel very passionately that we need to change and be fit for purpose.  The Irish people voted by a small majority to support the Seanad and have said we need to have a Seanad, but I believe we need to reinvent ourselves.  This is a very strong first step in that direction.  There are a couple of really key points from my perspective.  There should be an opening up of the franchise to graduates of all third level institutions.  Just because I came from a particular university, it does not mean I should have any special privileges.  There is nothing special about one third level qualification compared to any other.  This levels the playing field and it becomes a lot more democratic.  A lot more people can influence who sits in these Seanad seats.  That is really important in a modern Ireland.  It also starts a move in another direction towards supporting accountability and transparency and will show real value for money to the Irish people who supported them about a year and a half ago.<\/p> <p>This is just a beginning; there are two parts to it.  One is reform of the Seanad.  Who are the eligible candidates?  Who are the eligible voters?  What is the voting process and how are vacancies filled?  Who is in charge of all that?  It is proposed that a Seanad electoral commission would be the glue in organising and structuring this.  The second part of that is the process - how we do business and how we can be a lot more effective?  We are moving in that direction.  If we want to leave a legacy, there is one thing I see.  I am just learning - everybody here is very committed and is putting a lot of work in.  If we want to leave a legacy, let us make the Seanad really fit for purpose.  It is critically important in Irish politics.  It is really important for the Irish people, who have said that already.  They are supporting us in that.  Let us give them the changes they deserve.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and commend Senator McDowell on bringing the Bill to the House.  I thank Senator O'Donnell for sharing time with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#Q00600","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>In a summary of Seanad reform, from 1937 to 2003 we had the O'Rourke report of 2004, the Committee on the Constitution in 1967, the O'Keeffe report in 1997, the Lenihan report in 2002, the Gormley report in 2009, the Crown Bill in 2013, the Zappone-Quinn Bill in 2013, the Fianna F&aacute;il policy document in 2013, the Green Party policy document in 2015, the Constitutional Review Group in 1996, the report of the Labour Party, the Green Party and John Gormley in 2009 and the report of the Independent Senators and John Gormley in 2009.  I am exhausted already reading them out.  These proposals had 112 suggestions on the following areas: elections, automatic re-election of the Cathaoirleach, term and timing of elections, vacancies, nominations, gender balance, vocational panels, university seats, Taoiseach's nominees, the legislative process, Northern Ireland, the European Union and the international role, secondary legislation, public appointments, policy review, petitions, ordering of business, right of address, membership of the Cabinet by Senators, accountability of Government to the Seanad, nominations of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, salaries of Senators and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I am exhausted reading those out.  There have been about ten or 11 reports on the Seanad between 1937 and 2004, ending with the Manning-O'Toole report, which we have just heard, and Senator Michael McDowell's Bill now on the floor.<\/p> <p>The question we must ask ourselves, because this is a general discussion, is what distinguishes and identifies us in the eyes of the Irish people.  I can tell you that it is the composition of the Seanad and not our work.  That is what distinguishes us.  Our composition is our most visible feature.  We are not distinguished enough in our function.  The composition of the Seanad seems to be, in the eyes of a lot of people, the actual function of the Seanad.  The Seanad is ill understood and neither its best nor its worst features are understood or communicated to the public.  I lived out in Ballymun for 23 years and I did not know, even though I was supposedly educated, what went on in the Seanad.  It did not affect me; it did not communicate to me and neither did I communicate with it.  The public are aware of the vested interest of the Government and parties and they also understand our constitutional rigidity.  They watch our low prestige every day.  They know why the media does not concentrate on us and why sometimes when it does concentrate on us it is to ignite negative feelings.  We have a low profile and we are not understood.  We demand less media attention and we get less public attention.  We are not directly elected and we have no power to really challenge the Government.  The party leaders live in the Lower House and our reports gather dust.  There are continual calls for reform.  I will say again that there are still many vested institutions and vested interests.  We have constitutional rigidity, low prestige, negative feelings and unnecessary duplication.  If we want real legitimacy we must look to reform, not only of how we get in here - our composition and the many and varying routes to the great blue seats - but of what we do when we get in here.  I welcome the Bill.  It is flawed, but so am I.  It is a start.<\/p> <p>I will leave Members with some thoughts.  In my last five years in the Seanad, not one Bill was sent back.  Giving votes to people in Northern Ireland and the diaspora all over the world will not reform the Seanad.  We need to reform the Seanad from the inside out, not the outside in, and we need to reform not its composition but its function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#Q00700","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I will make some comment and observations from the Department.  In response to Senator O'Donnell's comments, I think the Seanad is great and has a lot to offer.  I totally agree with her about coming through education.  I barely knew what local government was about when I was in school, never mind what the Seanad or D&aacute;il were about.  All of us are in the process when we become politicians, whether in local government or as Senators, Deputies or Ministers.  We become absorbed in the process and what it is all about, and we know every little bit about it, or we think we do, but the members of Joe Public carry on with their lives and are busy doing all they have to do with work, families and sports, so they do not focus in on the detail of what we do.  Our responsibility is to get the detail right, make ourselves more relevant and change the process.  A lot of good work goes on here.  I have had a lot of opportunity to address this House and work with it on various proposals over the last couple of years in my other brief, both on science and on the skills strategy.  I value the input of this House.  It greatly improved all those policies.  We need to see how we can increase that offering and increase the work that Senators do here and the added value they bring to legislation and policy.  I am conscious that this Bill is mainly about the process and composition of the Seanad, how to get here and who has a say on who gets here.  It is not really about the powers and functions, which Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned.  That is another discussion we have to have.  Today's debate will focus on the overall principles of this House, but this Bill is about the process of electoral franchise, composition and who can vote.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am conscious of that, too.  There are many issues that need to be discussed, and not just in terms of the functions.  I do agree, however, that that discussion has to happen quite soon.<\/p><p>The Government believes in such reform.  As Senator McDowell said, the Taoiseach has endorsed the Manning report and is pursuing its implementation.  It does not mean that everything in the report is perfect.  Nor is everything perfect in this Bill.  We are, however, endorsing the process to move this forward and deliver that action.  In his opening comments Senator McDowell spoke about inaction and I totally agree with him.  We have had many discussions over the years, even before my time, about what reforms will or should happen here.  It is time to get down to basics now and start implementing some of that change, as well as bringing forward some reforms.<\/p><p>I have come here to listen to the debate but also with a view to taking action to move this matter on.  I will use some of my time not just to deal with the principles but also to highlight areas on which need to decide.  We may need to change some aspects on Committee Stage.  Senators might bear in mind that these issues will need to be teased out in the coming weeks and months.  This work will not be done in a spirit of finding fault with the legislation but to highlight some issues that need to be teased out further and addressed.  I have come here in a spirit of action and Members will understand that my drive in life is to bring in changes where necessary.  Hopefully we can work on that together and tease through some of the many issues that need to be discussed and addressed.<\/p><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Seanad Bill 2016.  I want to compliment the work undertaken on the Manning report.  I am conscious that some of the people proposing this Bill made a major contribution to the Manning report.  I recognise that fact, and that is why the Government is prepared to work with this Bill and will certainly not oppose it.  I recognise that some changes might be required, but we will engage in the process and bring it on to the next stage.<\/p><p>The stated purpose of the Bill is to implement the reforms proposed in the report of the working group on Seanad reform, otherwise known as the Manning report.  The initiation of this Bill provides a welcome opportunity to deepen our consideration of the electoral reforms proposed.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on this.  To clarify, the Bill does not deal with the process or functions of the Seanad, just reform of the electoral process.  We need to bear that in mind as we get down to the basics.<\/p><p>The Seanad Bill 2016 is a significant piece of legislation not least because, by introducing direct elections for a majority of Seanad seats, it proposes a radical departure from the arrangements that have been in place for the election of Members of this House.  The effect of the proposals for repealing the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937 and substantially overhauling parts of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 will be to provide Ireland with a second directly elected Chamber of Parliament with a substantially wider electorate than that in place for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#Q00800","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>How is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#R00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The Minister of State without interruption, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#R00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I am talking about it here.  Over the past number of years, much has been said and documented about Seanad reform.  We have had a number of reports, from the O&rsquo;Rourke committee report in 2004 to the Manning report in 2015, all proposing change.  While we have consensus on the need for change, we still do not have broad consensus on the detail of that change.  This is something the Government wants to pursue, working with Senators and our colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  It was raised by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who suggested to the Taoiseach that the implementation body would involve both Houses of the Oireachtas to try to drive that change forward.  If we get agreement on that it can happen quite soon, hopefully, in order to move it on.<\/p> <p>The proposers of the Bill before us have now set out their stall on the electoral reforms they wish to see implemented.  I am conscious that speakers so far have all recognised that the legislation is not perfect, but it is open to change and discussion in order to enhance this process.  I am not saying that this Bill is set in stone, and everyone recognises that we need to work on this in the months ahead.<\/p> <p>I recognise and acknowledge the great work that has gone into the preparation of this Bill.  It is a substantial Bill and is deserving of detailed consideration.  Today&rsquo;s debate gives us an opportunity to take a broad view of the proposals in the Bill.  We will have a general principled discussion but we must also get down to some detail.  On a first examination of the Bill, my Department has identified a number of significant issues that will need to be addressed in terms of how they would work in practice and having regard to the costs involved, which are as yet unknown.  Democracy is important and comes with a cost, which is fair enough.  We must bear in mind, as anyone in business would do, that there will be increased costs associated with this.  That does not mean we cannot do it, but we have to allow for it and plan accordingly.  There are some drafting inconsistencies in the Bill which will need to be addressed in due course.  That happens with all draft legislation.<\/p> <p>I will now turn to some of the differences between the Bill and the Manning report.  The first of these is that the Manning report proposes extending the franchise to citizens in the State, while the Bill before us this afternoon proposes to extend the franchise to all local government electors, including non-Irish citizens.  Second, the Manning report proposes that the franchise for Seanad elections would encompass holders of Irish passports living overseas.  This Bill proposes, however, to limit that franchise to Irish passport holders born in Ireland who reside outside the State.  There is a fair difference there and we will need to tease that out.  I am pointing out these differences for the purpose of seeking clarity and to analyse them.  Members should make clear what they are trying to achieve in this regard.  I am not coming from any particular viewpoint, but we have to tease out the matter and decide what we actually want.  When we come to examine the finer detail of the Bill on Committee Stage, we need to be clear in our thinking on this particular matter.  There is a big difference between an Irish passport holder living overseas and an Irish passport holder born in Ireland who resides outside the State.  We therefore need to tease that matter out.  Do we want the franchise in the State for Seanad elections to be wider than it is for D&aacute;il elections?  Do we want to limit the overseas franchise to those Irish citizens born in the State?  These issues need to be clarified as we go along.<\/p> <p>I will now deal with some of the other issues in the Bill that, in our view, would need further work and refinement.  I know it is neither necessary nor the practice in a Second Stage debate to analyse a Bill section by section.  However, I do think it is important to identify and highlight some of the implementation challenges presented by the provisions in the Bill.  As I said earlier, this is about deepening our consideration of the reforms proposed in the Manning report and bringing them forward.<\/p> <p>I have already mentioned the proposal in the Bill to extend the franchise for Seanad elections.  The proposal is to extend the franchise to all local government electors living in Ireland, to persons resident in Northern Ireland who qualify for Irish citizenship, and to Irish passport holders born in Ireland and living outside the State.  Under these arrangements, a conservative estimate of the number of persons who would be entitled to register and vote in Seanad elections is about 5.3 million.  Approximately 3.3 million people currently have that voting entitlement and there are a further 1.2 million that could seek it in Northern Ireland.  There are about 700,000 passport holders that we are aware of overseas.  There is probably some duplication in that, but the possibility is that we could be looking at 5.3 million people under these proposals.  There is no doubt about the operational challenges that would be required to deal with numbers of that order, especially given that nearly a third of the votes could be cast outside the State.  Dealing with large numbers of postal ballots will present logistical challenges.  Careful planning and adequate resources will be needed, not least because no change to the method of counting of votes is proposed.  We need to consider whether to change the method of voting.  Senators have been through the system and know that it would be a very slow process if we are going to extend it further.  I think we will probably need to change the voting system, but I do not know.  That is a personal observation, but I have not taken part in a Seanad campaign.  The vote counting method for greatly expanded constituencies would benefit from further expert analysis.  We need some additional detail on that, and I am sure Members have views on it.  None the less, we should examine the matter further. <\/p> <p>The Bill provides that the Seanad Electoral Commission should establish and maintain a register of Seanad electors.  We estimate that nearly two thirds of those who would be entitled to be on that register are already on the register of electors maintained by local authorities.  The cost and other issues arising in having parallel registers, one for Seanad elections and one for all other elections, should be carefully considered in the further development of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The new arrangements in the Bill for the election of Senators are based on the important principle of one person, one vote.  The Bill proposes that when applying for inclusion on the register of electors a voter will choose the constituency in which he or she will vote at Seanad elections.  Senator McDowell analysed that quite well earlier on, including the importance of allowing people to choose and identify their preference in that respect.  However, because the electorate for each constituency is self-selecting, there would be no way of knowing in advance how many people would opt to vote in each constituency.  That will cause logistical problems, but they can be solved while bearing other issues in mind also.  It is conceivable that some constituencies would have significantly more voters relative to others and relative to their respective numbers of seats.  There could be an imbalance in that regard.  The Bill provides for this to be addressed through a new Seanad register of electors.  This is done by setting a limit to the number of electors that would vote for candidates on each Oireachtas sub-panel of each of the five vocational constituencies.  The Bill provides for the Seanad Electoral Commission to reassign voters when the number of applications is outside that 18% to 22% limit.  The process might become complicated, as well as being unjust and unfair.  It is important to get that right, so we should tease it out to see how we will fully implement it.<\/p> <p>We see no comparable provision in the Bill for the nominating bodies, sub-panels of the five vocational constituencies, or for the institutions of higher education constituency.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Most would agree that the principle of one person, one vote is important from a democratic perspective and particularly in the situation of a direct franchise.  It is about how we are going to implement that and how the solutions to balanced constituencies provided in the Bill, as drafted, seem to be incomplete.  Even if the 18% to 22% limit was to be extended, it is not clear how it would work in practice, or how it could be made fair, transparent and easily understood by voters.  Again, it goes back to the point made by Senator O'Donnell earlier on about wanting to make this House relevant.  A key part of that is to make it easily understood and followed.  I still cannot follow how the whole process works and I am involved in politics.  We must try to make it very clear.  Above all, it has to be fair.  That is the bottom line on the issue I have just raised.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes changes in the nomination provisions of the 1947 Act.  Some 24 Members of this Twenty-fifth Seanad, elected from the vocational panels, were nominated by nominating bodies.  I expect that most of the Senators present are in regular contact with those bodies.  I am interested to hear the Senators' views and the views of the nominating bodies on the additional governance requirements the Bill would place on organisations seeking to be nominating bodies.  This is just part of the process.  We know that bringing in change is going to cause difficulty for people and more time and effort will be expended.  We need to hear the view of the Senators' and the nominating bodies.  The Senators are best placed to represent those views and to feed them back into this debate in the House.  There is a question I would ask.  Would the changes help to realise the ambitions of the working group by increasing the number and range of nominating bodies?<\/p><p>Another interesting aspect of the Bill is the first-time statutory definition of the knowledge and experience requirement for candidates on the vocational panels.  These include a formal qualification or several years of work experience in addition to verifiable practical experience relevant to the constituency in which the nominee is to stand.  The requirement may be met by establishing eligibility to the satisfaction of a judicial referee or assessor.  As we read it, this adds another step to the nomination process before the so-called \"completion of the panels\" provided for in section 36 of the 1947 Act.  Again, I am interested to hear the Senators' views on these proposed new arrangements but I am all in favour of what is behind them.  I agree fully with the principle of them without a doubt.  The question is around the process of it and how we see that working out.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for a revision of the numbers to be elected from each of the vocational panels.  These changes would see an increase in the number of Members from the cultural, educational and administrative panels, thereby increasing the knowledge and experience of these sectors in the House.  That is all very worthwhile.  The agricultural and labour panels would see a reduction in Members, which could result in a corresponding dilution of the knowledge and experience of those sectors in the House.  The rationale for these changes is not given in the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.  I am sure that each section will argue out the importance of that.  I presume it is to have balance, fairness and equality.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that application for entry to the register of electors may be made in electronic form and that ballot papers would be issued to each registered voter in electronic form as well.  However, the Bill does not set out how these arrangements would be implemented in a secure way nor, I accept, does the Manning report.  It puts it out there and says that this is something we should look at and do but nobody has really teased out how exactly we are going to achieve it.  The working group on Seanad reform engaged with the National Cyber Security Centre to explore the potential of the Internet and technology for improving and facilitating voter registration.  The National Cyber Security Centre report concluded that while online registration is a real possibility from a technical perspective, combining this system with some form of online ballot paper download gives rise to a number of security concerns that would have to be addressed prior to implementation.  It can be done but it will take a bit of time and thought and would have to be worked through.<\/p><p>I think Senators will agree that we must be very careful to ensure that the integrity of Seanad elections is not compromised in any way by use of the Internet or other technology.  Using technology is not a simple or quick resolution.  I accept that is not what is being proposed here.  I am just raising the point that we have to tease it out.  Given my previous role as a Minister for State with responsibility for driving Innovation 2020, the science strategy and the role of technology, I am all for it.  I welcome it.  We need to drive on and use technology wherever we can to reform our system.  However, we need to bear in mind that there is a security issue there.  I, for one, would have assumed that many other countries are doing this, that it is easy and working very well but that does not seem to be the case.  We need to analyse that a bit further and take on board the advice we have received from the National Cyber Security Centre.  These issues are all addressable and fixable but we need to bear in mind that there would be a bit of time and awkwardness involved and that we would need to tease it through.  We must learn from other countries as well.  I am conscious that the UK is using online registration.  The capacity of that system was called into doubt in the recent election but it was a start in the right direction.  Other countries are quoted in debates and when one drills down into, and analyses, the issue, there are questions there as well.  If we are going to do it, we have to get it right in order that people feel safe using it and that the system has full integrity.  I am one of those who was elected in 2002 with the electronic voting system.  I am all for technology because it got me in here in the first place.  We have to make sure that it is right and that everyone has faith and trust in it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#R00400","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It did not get the Minister of State in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#S00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>It was a major part of it.

New systems do not come without a price, as I said earlier on, especially at the development and introduction stage.  We do not have costings here.  In fairness, there was neither the time nor the capacity for anybody proposing this Bill to do all of that.  However, we have to do it and must analyse the cost behind it.  I am all for greater democracy, greater purpose for this House and greater enhancement of Senators' reputations.  The people who are here and who I have dealt with over the years deserve it.   We have to bear in mind that there will be costs involved in this.  There will be time delays, although I wish there were not.  If we are going to increase the potential franchise to 5.3 million voters as opposed to 162,000, there will be issues to tease out.

I note that he has never had to fight a Seanad election.  I hope he never has to.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill.  We were the only party to fight for the retention of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We did so on the basis that it would be reformed.  That is why we welcome this Bill.  We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  We have a number of issues with the Bill.  My colleagues in the party will outline their concerns with the reduction in the number of seats that will be allocated for Members of this House, the D&aacute;il and the local authorities to vote on.  We will tease that out on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>The issue that we welcome most in the Bill is the proposal that people who have Irish passports and who are living overseas and who were born in Ireland or in the North would have the right to vote in a reformed Seanad as well as those who are currently on the electoral register.  I note that the Minister of State pointed out the differences between the Manning report and the Bill as proposed.  Again, if we are talking about people who have no right to vote in a D&aacute;il election and have a right to vote in a local authority election, this would afford them the opportunity to have a voice within a Chamber of the Oireachtas.  That is something we will look at.  <\/p> <p>The core of this Bill on which I wish to speak today is the issue of giving a voice in this Chamber to those who are living overseas and in the North of Ireland.  The Minister of State has outlined some of the numbers.  Depending on who is doing the counting, there are 1.2 million Irish passport holders living overseas.  I have also seen figures of 700,000 and 800,000.  Of course, there are also those who are living in the North with Irish passports.  There might be an issue of whether they would have those passports in their possession.  Since Mr. Ian Paisley Jnr. has called on people to get as many Irish passports as they can, I am sure we will see the number who would be eligible to vote in the Seanad election from that jurisdiction increase.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, was talking about extending the franchise in presidential elections to those overseas.  There will be a parallel and twin-track process on the register if we manage to get these two huge reforms passed.  The principle of the issue is that the most fundamental right of any citizen in any nation is the right to vote.  Those who have Irish passports are counted as citizens under Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.  They are Irish citizens and yet we deny them the vote.  If we add up the number of people who in the North and the number living overseas who have Irish passports and who were born in Ireland, it is the equivalent population of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick cities combined.  Imagine that.  We do not allow that number of people to vote and yet they are citizens under our Constitution.<\/p> <p>When Daniel O'Connell fought for Catholic emancipation more than 180 years ago, the idea of Catholics having a vote was outrageous to the establishment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When the suffragettes fought for women to have the vote, the establishment and the commentariat thought it was outrageous.

That is not what it should be.  People laugh at me when I tell them I am a Member of the Seanad.

We were never meant to have Whips, and whipped votes.  We were meant to be a group of people with vocational interests who would offer expertise based on their vocational backgrounds.<\/p> <p>My view of a Seanad that would work is that if there were an agricultural question or Bill on the floor of the House, Members from the Agricultural Panel would advise us and we would vote according to the advice offered.  That is not the way the Seanad works.  We talk about the vocational panels' qualifications.  Let us be honest about it.  People have been voted into this Seanad on the Agricultural Panel and the closest they ever came to an animal was having a cocker spaniel at home.  That is not a qualification.  There are people who have been voted here on the Labour Panel who have never engaged in any way with labour or organised labour organisations.  That is not right.  How did that happen?

He has also outlined some practical issues with the implementation of the Bill if it was enacted.<\/p> <p>If this Bill was enacted in the morning as it is currently written - and I appreciate that nobody is suggesting this and that much more detail and further consideration has to be worked through - it would bring enormous burdens on resources, not only for the State but right across the globe in ensuring that those entitled to a vote under the Bill would be appropriately accommodated and facilitated.<\/p> <p>The Seanad Chamber is a legislative component of our constitutional architecture and it is fundamentally important that we get this Bill right.  That is not to say we should be afraid of change or reform because if anybody has listened over the last years - and Senators and colleagues have outlined previous working groups, reports too numerous to mention - the retention of a bicameral system as part of our democracy is something the Irish people want.  However, it is also clear that people want to see reform of this Chamber.<\/p> <p>If we are to be honest about the Chamber becoming relevant to the public and media interest, etc., duplicating the D&aacute;il is not the answer.  It is also my opinion that changing how people are elected into the Seanad is not fundamentally the answer.  The critical issue is around the functions and powers of the Seanad and is the area that will make the House most relevant.  I feel strongly that changing faces and places will only change the make up of the Seanad and may change the composition a little.<\/p> <p>This time 30 years ago I sat my leaving certificate and I had three options: I could go to college; I could take up an apprenticeship if I was lucky enough to be offered one; or I could emigrate.  I took up an apprenticeship.  Did I ever think on that day that I would get to serve in Parliament? I did not.  Did I ever think on that day that I would be a Member of Government or a Minister of State serving in high office?  I believe the system we currently have does need tweaking and reform but every citizen in the State has a right to be nominated for election, however they get to that point.  I mean no disrespect but I have a genuine fear that we cannot allow Parliament, including this House, to become the preserve of celebrities, academics or people who feel that the ordinary person cannot apply.  As an apprentice electrician and union member I consider myself to be an ordinary person.  Each and every person can bring life experience into the House and it should not be underestimated.  Current Senators and their contributions to debates should not be denigrated, whatever sector or experience they offer.  Let us be careful and not be backslapping ourselves too much.  Let us not feel that we are too important.<\/p> <p>There is a balance to be achieved in whatever reform happens in the House.  Powers and functions of the House are the critical areas and can perhaps be addressed through this Bill.  The Bill mainly speaks about the process by which Senators are elected and arrive in the House but if the House wants to become more relevant there are far bigger issues in the powers and functions which should be considered in more detail.<\/p> <p>The Minister has outlined that the Government is not opposing the Bill on Second Stage.  While we do agree with it in principle, and it is outlined in the programme for Government, there are a number of practical issues.  I will not go through all of them but they cover how it would work electorally to ensure the integrity of the process so that Senators' mandates are secure and proper, as it currently is in the constitution of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Senator Daly quite correctly outlined the importance of voices for the diaspora.  I would include voices for minority groups in the State.  However, there is no fast track to Parliament.  I am sure all Senators would agree that it is hard work and graft whether one is a member of a party or an Independent.  Regarding my earlier point about being an apprentice, I would not be standing here today unless I took an active civic interest in my community through civic engagement and activism, through local authority membership and by working my way up to be recognised in my own party.  That door is open to any individual in this State and there is a diverse range of parties and independent options that could accommodate those people.   This is not about providing a fast track to Parliament for somebody who might want to be a commentator or for celebrities and who think they can turn a key because they are well known.  I do not believe democracy is about that.  It is about bringing our life experiences, changing legislation and policy for the betterment of our citizens.<\/p> <p>We need to be very careful.  I shall now be critical once again of Senator Craughwell who has described the House as a nursery or creche.  He is playing to the bland descriptions of the Seanad by media commentators.  I think far more of this place, as I have always done.  I certainly do not believe the House is a nursery or a creche.  Yes it is great to be elected.  It is a privilege and an honour and one takes that experience to wherever one goes in the next step in life.  I was honoured to be a Deputy between 2007 and 2011 to which role I brought previous Seanad experience.  That is why I respected Senators' views more when I was a Minister of State.  That time was not wasted in a \"nursery\" as a party member.  It was a learning experience and something that I will forever bring with me, and I know that other Senators feel that way also.<\/p> <p>We must be careful of the language used in how Senators describe themselves.  I believe the Seanad has a great future and that it has great membership.  Colleagues can offer diverse perspectives and views on all debates.  It is important that those views are heard but there is a fundamental problem.  As a former Minister of State I know that it is the Executive of the day which holds the power.  The Government of the day, when a majority exists - and it need not be this Government, the previous or any other Government - decides whether Seanad amendments are accepted or not.  In the current regime of new politics, and one can describe it however one wishes, it is not a majority.  It is a minority Government and there is more engagement with the Opposition, which is a good thing.  That is democracy at work.  However, when the majority exists we must also respect that as democracy.  Whether we like it or not, whether one is an Independent or in a smaller party, when the citizens of the State elect a majority the decision should be respected.  Senators are a minority voice and that is what they were elected to reflect.  Senators are not a minority to change legislation.  In a democracy the majority of the day dictates how Government works and dictates the legislation.<\/p> <p>We must be careful but this is a very welcome debate.  It behoves all Senators to be honest in the debate and not be knocking the process for popular reasons.  Media commentators who have knocked the Chamber for years would give their right arm to be in here and their left arm to have the privilege of standing up in this Chamber.  We should all be very proud to be here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#U01000","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>As a prelude to my thoughts on the Bill I want to address a couple of points made earlier about the relevance of the Seanad and especially the attempts to denigrate the Seanad.  I am a new Senator and am in the House only a couple of weeks.  There are two very important things to me and to the people I serve in the west of Ireland that we were able to do through this House.  One was the situation around homes affected by pyrite.   It was not a local issue as it affected hundreds of homes across the State.  My colleague, Senator Mac Lochlainn, and I were able to speak to the Minister on the importance of the matter and the need for the Minister to address it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank him for the work he has done since and for the work he plans to do around that issue.  For me, that was very relevant.<\/p><p>The other opportunity we had was around the bin charges and the instrument that was available to us there regarding the annulment of the ministerial order.  If each individual within this Chamber chooses not to use that instrument, it is down to him or her and he or she must reflect on not using that opportunity.  It should not be used as an excuse to denigrate the House.  I am not here for the good of my health.  I leave my children three or four days a week to come up here and make a difference, to represent people, and to put rural Ireland front and centre in the Oireachtas and in this Chamber.  That is what I intend to spend the rest of my time here doing.  I cannot stand over the denigration that has happened in previous conversations and I always respect everyone's opinion and the experience they are bringing to this Chamber.  We can learn from each other.  However, Senators are not speaking in my name when they say the Seanad is a useless place or somewhere that is referred to as a cr&egrave;che or a nursing home.  I am in neither a cr&egrave;che nor a nursing home, thanks be to God.<\/p><p>On the panels, reference was made to the agricultural panel and the fact that people come from different panels and have no experience of it.  I was elected on the agricultural panel because I am passionate about the contribution agriculture can make to our economy and to society and the experiences of agriculture I bring into this House.  Getting back to the Seanad Bill, we in Sinn F&eacute;in will support any measure to make Seanad &Eacute;ireann more inclusive.  We will not, therefore, oppose this Bill's passage to Committee Stage.  I thank the working group whose recommendations and draft Bill form much of the Bill that is before us today.  Like many others, I have been frustrated at the lack of progress since the referendum results in 2013.  It was clear to all that although the people wanted to retain the Seanad, it could not be business as usual.  It was only in July of last year, months before the general election, that my own party leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, and other party leaders were invited to a meeting with the Taoiseach on Seanad reform.  This turned out to be nothing more than a box-ticking exercise at the tail-end of a term that had promised root and branch reform from the outset.<\/p><p>There are many progressive aspects to this Bill, yet alongside them are retained elements which allow for elitism and abuse of the Seanad by major political parties.  We specifically welcome section 8, which inserts a new section into the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 as a measure that increases the franchise.  I am somebody who has lived outside this country and who was forced to emigrate for 13 years.  I arrived in London with &pound;5 in my pocket.  I would have liked to have had an opportunity to have a say in what was happening back here in my home at that time.  I will passionately defend the right of the Irish diaspora to vote and to have a say in their own country.  The fact they are forced to emigrate does not mean we should cut them off and not recognise their Irish citizenship.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in would not have limited this electorate to voting for 30 seats but would seek that the entire Seanad be directly elected.  Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>The Bill is just that - a Bill that can only repeal or amend previous legislation relating to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In our submission last year to the working group on Seanad reform, and, indeed, the very first motion we placed on the Order Paper of this session, we argued for a committee on Seanad reform that could propose and lay out in detail far-reaching and fundamental change.  Many of the criticisms I and my party have regarding the shortcomings of this Bill could form the basis of a plan of work for this proposed committee.  Some of this change would involve constitutional change and, more crucially, input from all Members of the current Seanad, over 40 of whom are newly elected.  The problem with this Bill is that, by its very nature, it cannot propose constitutional change.  It cannot remove the provision for the appointment by An Taoiseach of 11 Members.  Needless to say, we in Sinn F&eacute;in would advocate the removal of this provision from the Constitution.  The most recent Taoiseach's appointments not only showed that they are open to abuse by the Taoiseach, but the fact that a deal was done weeks beforehand with Fine Gael's facilitators in government, Fianna F&aacute;il, led to cynicism among the public.<\/p><p>This Bill provides for the repeal of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937 in its entirety.  Sinn F&eacute;in views the replacement of this Act with the provision for another constituency limited to graduates of all institutions of higher education as a missed opportunity.  While the Bill gives effect to the decision of the people in the 1979 referendum to give votes to graduates from all institutes of higher education, Sinn F&eacute;in would seek to remove this provision.  It is entirely unjust that a person's ability to vote in the Seanad election is determined by their level of formal education.  There is no explicit provision to increase representation of marginalised groups within Irish society.  It has been proven time and again that merely tweaking electoral rules does not increase representation among the marginalised.  The Seanad is the ideal mechanism for direct intervention and reaching out to those who traditionally are disengaged from politics or are under-represented.<\/p><p>There is a serious anomaly in the current set-up of the Oireachtas.  If the Lower House represents the political, geographical interests of the State on a population basis, then their social, cultural and economic interests should be represented in the Upper House on a sectoral basis.  I would like to see this distinction between Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann maintained and strengthened.  When we talk of representing minorities and the marginalised, we must also focus on areas such as the west and the Gaeltacht, whose people have been marginalised by their very place of residence.  While welcoming the positive aspects, such as the extension of the franchise to those who are resident in the North and those in the diaspora, we feel the spirit of democratisation should have been progressed much further.  We want a Seanad that has the experience, expertise and time to consider legislation, to give ears to those outside the legislative process and engage with those who traditionally have been outside the entire political process.  We use the term \"engage\" in its most direct sense - we want to see citizens talked about and talked to in the Seanad on the issues affecting them.  We believe all this is best obtained through an open and direct election by the entire electorate.  We look forward to the Committee Stage of this Bill, where we will have further discussion on the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#U01100","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Civil Engagement group, we are very proud to support the proposal of this Bill and to support it through Second Stage.  We have talked about this being timely.  In fact, I think it has gone beyond being timely and is now urgent.  We have the imperatives of the multiple reports over so many years, as outlined by Senator O'Donnell, but we also now operate under two further imperatives, including the highest level of imperative, that is, a referendum.  In the referendum in 1979, the people gave us an imperative to reform the university panels and now, in the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, people gave a strong, incontrovertible moral mandate for the reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>We have heard about people's lack of belief and lack of faith in politics and disaffection.  We saw something quite different in the last referendum.  What we saw in that was a commitment to hope.  It was an act of faith.  We had millions of people who did not themselves have the opportunity to vote in the Seanad and nonetheless voted for its retention because they saw its potential, because it was something they were interested in and they understood the value of national conversation and thematic conversation.  They saw that the debates that happen in this space are important and they wanted to be part of them.  This was a powerful message, sent by the whole of the population of Ireland.  It cannot be ignored.  It needs to be acted upon.<\/p> <p>When we talk about this Seanad and this moment being seized, it has to be that this Seanad, the first Seanad saved from abolition by the Irish population, which shows it is listening to and respecting that population and it wants them to be part of our decision-making process and of shaping us.  We talk about a national House.  I campaigned actively for the retention of the Seanad because I wanted it to be a national House that reflected all of the nation.  I wanted to see the thematic concerns reflected.  I could see how important and interesting they were for people.  I know people value all these debates and what we have today is a sign that we take it seriously.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and other groups have spoken.  There is a general recognition across all sides of the House this is the time when Seanad reform needs to come through.  This is why we need to move forward on Second Stage.  Technical considerations should be dealt with but we should not look for any excuse to delay this.  <\/p><p>Moving to some practical aspects of the proposals facing us, this Bill is extraordinarily reasonable.  It has balanced out many of the considerations raised over many years in respect of the Seanad.  The issue of cost was strongly rejected by the people when they chose democracy as a crucial message over any question of costs.  The chose greater democracy and not less democracy in the referendum.<\/p><p>In respect of the diaspora, I echo the concern and support voiced and I am very happy to see it right across the House in respect of the importance of a voice for those who have had to leave Ireland.  The question of how we manage the numbers is dealt with very considerately by looking to the issue.  This Bill would extend the vote to those born in Ireland who hold a current passport.  This addresses some of the scaremongering we sometimes see around the idea of an electorate of millions that will appear.  It will be an electorate of those who are passionate, committed and engaged with Ireland and who have strong roots in this country.  <\/p><p>In respect of the vocational panels, the Civil Engagement group is united in a shared concern around strengthening the voice of civil society in these Houses.  We see the vocational panels as being the way whereby those thematic concerns relating to issues of crucial importance of people and which may not be geographically bound but which have constituencies of concern across the country can be reflected so they can see their voices reflected.  In this sense, the reform of the vocational panels proposed in the Bill is extraordinary and important.  It will bring meaning and strength back to the idea of a cultural and educational panel when it allows us to address the differing views on education we have across our country.  In respect of the labour panel, we can see differing questions of workers' rights that emerge.  We look to the concerns of industry and small businesses across Ireland having a genuine force of representation and being able to organise and ensure they are represented.  <\/p><p>I would not be as cynical as some have been in respect of those who have been elected to those panels.  Having spoken to many of my fellow Senators, I recognise that many of the Senators here from all parties have a strong interest in these areas of civil society.  However, this will widen the conversation they are having.  While many Senators here who have been elected through vocational panels may be very passionate about the areas of agriculture and education, this will give them the opportunity to widen the conversation they have beyond the base of councillors to the other groups in society who care about these issues.  It is a wider conversation.  I believe many people who are passionate about these issues will persevere, prevail and come through with a stronger mandate by being able to have those conversations.  I agree with Senator Coffey that each and every person has experience.  I also agree that each and every person in this country has experience that could be brought to bear in voting for the vocational panels.  Again, this is about recognising experience rather than denigrating it.  It is about recognising the breadth of experience and interest in our society.  <\/p><p>In respect of some of the concerns expressed by the Minister of State, I agree that there might be concerns about the balancing of constituencies on the vocational panels and the size of the panels.  There may be scope for constructive amendment in these areas to ensure that we manage that.  They may be the solution to each other because we might be able to address those concerns by making the size of the panel responsive to the size of the constituency.  This is something we can do constructively.  <\/p><p>In respect of the university panels, there was a vote in 1979 where people signalled that they wanted to expand this franchise.  During my campaign, I visited the technical colleges and the University of Limerick and talked to many of those excluded from the franchise who are passionate about and want to contribute to this national conversation.  We must not avoid moving forward on extending the franchise for the university panels.  However, I would give some ameliorating thought to those who have expressed concern about this panel becoming huge.  I believe when we have vocational panels that allow for thematic consideration, there may be many who choose not to exercise their vote in the university panels but instead to vote on a vocational panel.  That will be the case as a much larger swathe of the population is coming through college and university structures.  Again, I think the solutions are there in the rebalancing in this very well thought through Bill.  It would address the anomaly of the dual vote.  Nobody can justify an anomaly whereby people have two votes in this country.  <\/p><p>I urge people to enthusiastically embrace this Bill as an opportunity.  I believe it is an opportunity for all of us in the House and that we can go down as a landmark Seanad that has put a mark on history.  Yes, we need to look to changes in our powers, procedures and operations but I am enthusiastic about engaging with those changes.  I certainly came in here excited and hopeful and I know many other Senators did as well in our two thirds new Seanad.  Those changes are important but they are not sufficient if we slam the door on the public which has opened the door of the Seanad and allowed us to walk into a Seanad it had the power to bolt and close forever.  If we slam the door and say that we do not care about the public's participation and that we are doing some complicated technical things, it would be a shameful message to send.  Let us treat the public with the respect with which it has treated us.  Let us open the Seanad to it and solve all small problems constructively together on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#V00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I very much support this Bill.

Twenty years ago, I never thought that I would even be on Roscommon County Council or elected to the D&aacute;il twice so I am very honoured to be in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>I was first elected to the Seanad in 2002 on the administrative panel.  There were five different panels.  I want to take issue with one or two people.  There are three panels that I would have been unable to contest.  I could not contest the labour panel because I was not a member of a trade union.  I could not contest the cultural and educational panel because I never entered third-level education.  I could not contest the agricultural panel because, as they say in Boyle, I came from the yard of a counter and if I went to a mart, I would be found out.  Those checks and balances were there and there were only two panels I could have got on to - the administrative panel and the industrial and commercial panel.  However, I bring life experience.

We sometimes find academic snobbery in this country whereby people are put in their place.  Growing up in a town, one would see the doctor, dentist and solicitor.  They could all be great drinkers who drank a bit too much in the local pub but they were great.  However, if a tradesman drank a bit too much, he was an alcoholic.

Sometimes one needs to hear the views of the person from the farmyard, the shop and the trade union as well as those of educationalists and academics and to have a bit of backbone.  That is what this Seanad is about and we have a good balance.  However, the way Senators are elected is outdated and undemocratic.  One must hand it to the Taoiseach for having the backbone to put the matter before the people, who voted to retain the Seanad.  We can laugh all we want about the matter.  In 2002, Seanad reform was to be brought in and it was said on radio that it would make a difference and that we would do this and that but, unfortunately, it never saw the light of day.

In 1987, there were not too many members in the Republic of Ireland's supporters club - maybe 17,000 or 18,000 - and soccer was almost a minority sport.  The majority of people - approximately 3,000 - who came back for an Ireland-Belgium match were from London and the UK.  They  formed the backbone of the Republic of Ireland's supporters club and were more Irish than we were.  It is wonderful to see that we were able to extend that franchise to people in London, where I could have grown up, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Northern Ireland.  I support this wonderful initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#X01100","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  I commend Senator McDowell for bringing forward this important legislation.  Indeed, I thank the Leader and the Government party for giving Government time to this legislation.  This is an indication of the new politics we saw in evidence in this House last week when we had Committee Stage of our Private Members' Bill on freelance workers' rights.  We did so in Private Members' time but the Government promised to give us Government time for Report Stage of the Bill.  It is an indication of how well the Seanad can work.<\/p><p>Colleagues will forgive me for a slight sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.  Like Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said earlier, and like so many others here, I am familiar with the many debates that we have had over the years on Seanad reform.  I count myself as very privileged and honoured to have been re-elected for a third term in the Seanad.  I value every colleague in the Seanad equally, a view that should not need to be said.  Every one of us brings our own unique life experiences and background to the Seanad.<\/p><p>I agree that we have had so many reports and debates on reform and yet this new Seanad has a new dynamism and energy due to the number of new Senators elected to the House.  The Manning report has provided us with a blueprint for reform.  When we debated the Manning report in May of last year and the draft Bill that Dr. Maurice Manning and Mr. Joe O'Toole prepared, from which Senator McDowell's Bill borrows, we said that this should be the last report on Seanad reform and that we should be able to unite in principle behind the Bill.  Therefore, I am glad that the legislation has received general support across the House.  I am happy to indicate the Labour Party's support for the Bill, while, like many others, recognising some flaws in it or issues that we would like to see improved on.  Certainly, we welcome the legislation.<\/p><p>The Labour Party has tabled an amendment to Sinn F&eacute;in's motion on Seanad reform simply calling for the establishment of an implementation group on Seanad reform because we believe a smaller implementation group might be more capable of working speedily.  We also recommend that an implementation group has a timeframe of 12 months to implement the recommendations of the Manning report.  It is in the same spirit as this Bill.  We call on the implementation of a report rather than draft a new one or start from scratch.<\/p><p>The context in which we debate this Bill and in which Dr. Maurice Manning's group worked was the context in which we looked at reforms that could be implemented through legislation within the current constitutional framework.  All of us might like to see particular changes to the Constitution.  In the Labour Party Senator's group, we have said we would like to see changes made to the Taoiseach's power to nominate 11 Senators and the existing five vocational panels.  However, the agreement, and I think the pragmatic approach, is to ask what can we do within the current constitutional framework and that is the aim of this Bill, that is, to seek the maximum change we can achieve within the constitutional framework.<\/p><p>The previous Labour Senator's group made a submission on Seanad reform to Dr. Maurice Manning's group in January 2015.  We put forward a number of proposals.  The key proposal, and one that has been reflected both in the report and in this Bill, is the proposal for universal suffrage - or one person, one vote.  The need to achieve universal suffrage is a principle on which everyone in the House is united, although we may differ on how best to achieve it.  I want to offer some constructive proposals but we all agree that we should move towards that model.<\/p><p>In the last Seanad, we made certain procedural changes that did not require legislation.  These included, for example, the establishment of a public consultation committee.  That committee has held hearings and produced reports on a number of key issues such as the human rights of older persons, lifestyle changes to prevent cancer and farm safety.  These were new and dynamic ways in which the Seanad could be seen to work.  We brought in different interest groups and held public hearings in this Chamber on different days.  We had a series of debates with MEPs to improve and strengthen our links with the European Parliament.  We also brought in a number of distinguished visitors to speak to us.  We need to ensure that all of those changes are continued.  We need to continue to change the way we work in this House without the need for legislative change in order to be a more dynamic and more effective Chamber.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I said, we are happy to support this Bill.  In general, it will lead to a hugely improved and more democratic Seanad.  In principle, the need to extend the suffrage for the Seanad and ensure an increased number of voters is a hugely important issue.  In our submission the Labour Party proposed the extension of suffrage to those entitled to be on the local election register.  This Bill there proposes to go beyond that to include the diaspora, which I believe all of us would support in principle.  How this would be done is an issue.  I believe that the approach taken in the Bill to restrict this entitlement to current Irish passport holders is a practical limitation.  As the Minister said, the logistics and costings in that regard need to be examined in detail.  Some of us are already elected by diaspora voters.  A huge proportion of voters on my own panel are Irish citizens who live abroad.  We should be conscious that the Seanad, as currently constituted, represents members of the diaspora.<br\/><br\/>There is a particular issue in the Bill about which I would like to speak, which issue I raised when we debated the report of the working group on Seanad reform on 8 July 2015.  The Minister stated in his speech that there may be a difficulty in the Bill with balancing constituencies.  Under the provisions of this Bill and as proposed in the report of the working group on Seanad reform, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, the voter chooses the constituency in which he or she will vote in Seanad elections.  As I pointed out previously this means that panels could be very skewed.  For example, in regard to section 8, 100,000 people might opt to vote in the arts panel and, although nobody is quite sure about this, there could be 850,000 voters potentially on the universities panel.  As such, we could have very skewed numbers on different panels.  <br\/><br\/>I note that Senator McDowell has proposed a complicated amendment to section 9 by way of a new section 45(1) such that limits would be applied to the number of elected representatives who would be registered in respect of a single constituency.  The Labour group gave this some thought and we have come up with what I believe is a simpler and, perhaps, less cumbersome change, namely, that everybody entitled to vote on the Seanad electoral register would have a separate vote for candidates on each of the panels.  In other words, a voter would not have to opt for one panel but would have five votes on the different panels.  University graduates would opt for a vote on the universities panel instead of another particular panel.  We suggested the national language, culture, literature, art and education panel.  We also suggested that in accordance with Article 19 of the Constitution one of the panels would be reserved for election by city and county council members to preserve the existing link with local government which we believe is important.  We believe that the public administration panel might be the most appropriate in that regard.  I note there is a proposal in the Bill to preserve some voter rights for councillors.  It is important that we preserve the link with local government in some way.  The proposal put forward by Senator McDowell that we might look at changing the current position in legislation whereby councillors are not entitled to be Members of the Seanad is interesting.  The preservation of one panel for election by councillors would not require constitutional change.  One could also amend the current eligibility rules to enable councillors stand for election to that panel.<br\/><br\/>Returning to the Labour Party proposals, to protect against unbalanced panels, each individual registered on the Seanad electoral register would have five votes on five panels and could vote 1, 2 and 3 on each of those panels.  It would be akin to a multi-seat constituency.  This would guard against the skewing of voter numbers on different panels.  It would also guard against what I believe is a real danger in this area, individual candidates organising registration campaigns on a particular panel to ensure they were more likely to be elected to it.  We need to look at the practical implications of the panel system.  <br\/><br\/>We need to look again at the online facilities and so forth.  The working group on Seanad reform consulted on this with the National Cyber Security Centre, which provided some practical points on how to address security issues.  The postal ballot requirement in the Constitution is a difficulty.  In terms of the use of technology to try to reduce the cost of the postal ballot the Bill is very progressive.  We should also introduce a system like <i>checktheregister.ie<\/i>to enable people to check if they are registered to vote.<br\/><br\/>The Labour group has also put forward in its proposals one very radical but simple change which I believe could make a huge difference to the make-up of the Seanad, which, again, would not require constitutional change, namely, that a Seanad election should take place on the same day as a D&aacute;il election.  Article 18.8 of the Constitution provides that a Seanad election must take place not later than 90 days after dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  The Labour group proposes that it be provided by way of legislation that a Seanad election take place on the same day as a D&aacute;il election on a PR-STV basis by secret postal ballot.  Legislation could prohibit a candidate from running in both elections, which would break the direct link between D&aacute;il and Seanad elections often criticised by many.<br\/><br\/>I thank Senator McDowell for introducing this Bill and thank the Minister of State for his support for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#X01200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill in principle but it will be putting forward amendments to it on Committee Stage.

We need real action not more idle talk.  The Seanad is an important venue for a diverse range of expert voices and is a crucial check on the business of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

I am not criticising any individual Senator: they all have their value but the rotten boroughs have to go.  The Taoiseach's 11 nominees is one of those rotten boroughs.

The independence will be gone.  Senator Craughwell is an accident - a very good and valuable accident, but it only happened because the Taoiseach tried to put some fellow from Donegal who ran a petrol station onto the board of the Irish Museum for Modern Art.

It is the oldest and most distinguished constituency in this country.  I am looking at the number of people that will be brought into the constituency.  I do not want to denigrate anyone, but this is bringing in tradespeople.  It is bringing in house painters through the mention of \"a linked provider of a designated awarding body as defined by the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012\".

I have always felt there should be some element of representation, but a third of the electorate is a hell of a lot of people - nearly 2 million people.  What happened to the old idea of no representation without taxation?  One third of the voters will be people who do not pay any tax in this country.  That is something I would hesitate over.<\/p> <p>How will the register for people in the North of Ireland be put together?  The Bill states that the register shall contain various things such as a person's e-mail address.  What about the Data Protection Act?  I think the Data Protection Act is a curse.  One comes across it all the time.  I do not know how they will get over that.  There is also a situation where people can chop and change and they will go into the ones where there is the least number of constituents so we could have a distortion there.  There is also the electronic form.  What happened to the peann luaidhe?  I am rather a fan of the peann luaidhe.<\/p> <p>In the section on application for entry in the register, there is a huge amount of bureaucracy which I will not go into at this stage.  There is the unutterable meanness of saying that people cannot stand in the university seats if they have an honorary degree.  Why the hell not?  An honorary degree is normally a huge honour.  Of course it should entitle them to be considered as a graduate and then I see that for the first election they will maintain the original register for the universities.  Well hello - I wish them joy in concocting the next one.<\/p> <p>In choosing the nominating bodies, nothing whatever is said about revising them.  It is really important to bring the nominating bodies into the 21st century and to get them to nominate people.  For example, the RDS was approached by several candidates but it refused to nominate anybody.  In my opinion that is a dereliction of duty so the nominating bodies need to be looked at.  Then we have the provision whereby if one is a Member of the Seanad already one does not have to qualify.  Come on - that is a real stinker.  That is a rotten exemption.<\/p> <p>With regard to the nominations for the university seats, one can nominate oneself.  Nowadays one has to have a nominator and a seconder and one cannot nominate oneself.  There has to be eight centres, bringing the number of centres to 40 which is far too many and one has to make a deposit of &euro;900.  I can afford that amount but what about other people.  We heard Senator Ruane speak about how she got into the university as an undergraduate.  If people like Senator Ruane could afford the &euro;900 there are many other people who would be disenfranchised by this cost.  I am against that - it is free at the moment and should remain free.<\/p> <p>The issuing of ballots is only in electronic form.  I have never used a computer in my entire life and I hope and expect to go to my grave a computer virgin.  What will happen to me?  Will I not be allowed a vote because I dislike computers?  They will find there are plenty of auld farmers around the joint who do not have computers so why should they be excluded?  There should be one ballot paper for the constituency.  My God almighty, that is a cracker.  There will be one ballot paper for this monstrous constituency.  In the last election there were 30 candidates for NUI and 17 for Trinity, that is 47 candidates.  Under this Bill there will be about 150 candidates.  I doubt if people will bother their backsides to vote for 150 candidates.  Then there is the qualifications.  That they have to be listed in alphabetical order is a form of discrimination.  That gives automatic advantage to people who are at the top of the alphabet.

I am an NUI graduate and I currently have a vote for the NUI panel.  However, many of my family, friends, colleagues and neighbours attended other education institutions, such as Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin City University, and do not have a vote.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This proliferation of third level institutes reflects a changing Irish society and development in the education sector.  These graduates should have the right to elect six university Senators.  If the right were extended to them, we would have a more accurate representation of graduates in the Seanad.  This change would be in keeping with the spirit of the reasoning behind the original university seats.<\/p><p>At this point I reference Senator Norris's contribution, although it is a pity he is not still in the House.  He took issue with the change and stated it is extending the right to vote to house painters and tradespeople.  He argued they were not university attendees and that is correct; nevertheless, tradespeople have a wealth of experience and engage in extensive training, education and examination.  That should be embraced.  On the same point, Senator Norris took issue with the fact that people with honorary degrees were not considered degree holders in this Bill.  I maintain that honorary degree holders might have less education, experience and training, having taken fewer examinations, than tradespeople.  I do not see his reasoning behind that.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il certainly do not support that view.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Mark Daly, made a passionate contribution on extending the right to vote to Irish citizens living in the North and overseas.  I commend him in this regard.  Our diaspora has made a very valuable contribution to this country and it is about time those people are valued and given a vote.  Our diaspora kept the country going in the lean years of the 1940s and 1950s by sending money home to support families.  The newer members of our diaspora left our shores in recent years - equally lean - and some might wish to return in the near future.  They have expressed such a desire to their families.  It is time we gave them a voice and allowed them to shape the country to which they will return.<\/p><p>My party colleagues have mentioned that we may bring some amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage and I will briefly touch on one of them.  We do not feel the number of Senators elected by local authority members and Members of both the Upper and Lower Houses of the Oireachtas should be reduced to 13.  These electors - I am referring mainly to sitting county councillors - are embedded in every community in Ireland and they have their finger on the pulse.  They are often the only point of contact for communities and the political infrastructure and it serves democracy well having them directly elect Members of this House.  Local authority members have over the years seen their power eroded, their workload increase and their remuneration decrease.  I cannot stand over reducing their capacity to elect members of this House to 13 Members.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be tabling an amendment in this regard.<\/p><p>I also make reference to Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell's comments that this Bill only reforms how the Seanad is elected.  She made a very good point but if we start at this point, perhaps a different hue to the Seanad would see how we do business in the House reformed.  I thank the Senator for her contribution.  Fianna F&aacute;il wholeheartedly supports this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#Z00800","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I have listened with great interest to the various parts of this debate, both inside and outside the Chamber.  I suppose one wonders whether there is a yearning for reform in here at all.  I will share my thoughts nonetheless.<\/p> <p>I am delighted and very proud to have been elected a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is something I never thought I could dream of.  I have no academic qualifications and I was not in school from six to seven to eight years old, through no circumstances of my own making.  I later studied horticulture, thanks to the Department of agriculture and its grant and subsidy.  It allowed me to go to Teagasc and study horticulture through sweat and tears.  I worked at age 11 in a bakery out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to pay for my education.  My greatest ambition was to buy a bicycle at 14 so I could cycle to my school and, eventually, to college.  The Seanad allows people to come here.  The day I walked in the door, every hair on my neck stood up with pride, as I was coming here with people close to me and who supported me through those difficult times.  I was coming to the very centre of political life in this country.  It opens doors, which I acknowledge.  Nobody wants to come here to speak about personal experiences but we all see the world from where we stand and our experiences within that world.  We bring those experiences to the very core and being of what we try to do for the good of other people.  We also work for our integrity and self-esteem, which is important.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Michael McDowell for introducing this important Bill.  Many us remember that before we were ever in the Seanad we spoke about the opportunity to be here.  A number of people said to me, and I imagine to many people here, that they resented the fact that the Seanad is for the academics or the political dynasties.  These are the people coming here as a stepping stone, and as a Senator has honestly said, with the goal of getting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is not right.  We must allow every citizen of the country, within the criteria, to exercise a franchise and vote for the Seanad.  This is not and should not be a private club.  Every citizen of the country who is eligible to vote should be allowed to do so.  The big difficulty is how we can bring this about.<\/p> <p>I note this Bill is being discussed in Government time.  That is a profound indication of the Government's support for it.  I note on page 149 of the programme for Government it states: \"However, significant reform of the Seanad itself is now long overdue.  We will pursue the implementation of the Manning report.\"  That is the Government's commitment.  I note Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin personally sponsored and pushed a Private Members' Bill relating to Seanad reform and it is very interesting to note what the party proposed.  It will be interesting to see if it is consistent in its proposals as we go through this debate in the next few weeks.  We have cross-party support.  Senator Ivana Bacik outlined some of Labour's commitments for Seanad reform as well.  There is much talk about reform but now it is about action.<\/p> <p>Deputy Martin, the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, indicated with respect to the Taoiseach's nominees that \"he requires the Taoiseach to take into consideration the need to ensure the following groups or sectors in this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland are considered for nomination: the elderly; the young; the new Irish community; the Irish diaspora; people with disabilities; sporting organisations; the arts, the Travelling community\".  To be fair to the Taoiseach, he has reflected those in his nomination and I can have no criticism of them.  It reflects the broad spectrum and let us be fair.<\/p> <p>I have some concerns, as part of ongoing Seanad reform, about the Taoiseach's power to nominate 11 nominees.  That is clearly provided for in what I like to call \"the people's book\", the Constitution.  I heard speakers today talking about the Constitution and the Manning report indicates we should operate within parameters without having to go to a constitutional referendum.  We are democrats and politicians so let us never fear going to the people.  We know what the people said.  I note Deputy Regina Doherty is not in the House so I will not quote extensively from what is attributed to her in the national press.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, was personally disappointed with the result of the referendum and the defeat of the proposal to abolish the Seanad.  He accepted the result and we must also accept his bona fides.  He is a democrat and has lived by the commitment on that day at Dublin Castle, so we must move on.  There is no point looking back and scapegoating anybody else.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was broad political consensus among the political parties and others that we need reform.<\/p><p>The elephant in the room are the councillors who have traditionally elected 43 Members.  That is the bigger issue.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has indicated its position clearly, to which I am sympathetic.  I was elected, something for which I make no apologies.  Turkeys do not vote for Christmas.  This is a Chamber where we are discussing our business.  <\/p><p>I want to make a stronger case.  The elected county and city councils around the country have a democratic mandate.  They enrich the lives of the citizens in their communities.  I am very uncomfortable with any erosion of that number because they are elected and have a democratic mandate.  They bring representations into the House, which is an important point.  <\/p><p>On Committee Stage, I would like to see some consideration given to the possibility of there being only two terms for any Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, including me.  I am not sure if anybody should sit in the House for more than two full terms.  We are discussing Seanad reform.  If we cannot make an impression within two terms, what are we doing here?  We have to be honest and have broader reform.<\/p><p>I welcome the contribution of Senator McDowell.  It is very important, and I co-signed it because it is important that we have this debate.  I have no difficulty with the Manning report and I pay tribute to all who worked on it.  Let us not fear a referendum, if we need to push the issue out further.  There is no rush; let us get things right. <\/p><p>There may be an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out the issues.  There is no point in kicking the issue down the road.  The sooner we confront and explore the issues and each part of the process in regard to the Bill, the better.  There are five Stages to a Bill.  Let us not have things go on and on because the people are watching and reading about the debates.  The people have given the Government a clear instruction that they want their Seanad, which is enshrined in their Constitution, protected.  They also want it respected and for us to respect the institution.<\/p><p>How we conduct ourselves in here, operate, attend to our business and bring our individual expertise and life experience to the table is very important and reflects the real work of the Seanad.  Let us never deny anyone an opportunity to seek election, to be able to vote and to be elected, to pull up a chair to the Seanad table and participate in what is a great House.  I hope it continues to be great and do the great work done by many of our predecessors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#AA00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I support the Bill which is very important.  Seanad reform has been spoken about for as long as I have been involved in politics, and longer.  I have been involved in politics for almost 15 years and we have talked about Seanad reform in many ways.  This is the first time we will see real Seanad reform, which has to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>The biggest issue for the general public is how this can relate what they do during a normal day.  That is a challenge for everybody who sits in the House.  How can we make sure that what we are doing here will affect the people?  Will they take note of the fact that we have increased the electorate?  I do not know whether they will.  The real challenge for us as parliamentarians is trying to convey what we are doing here to the public.  I do not think increasing the electorate will do that.  We have to look at ourselves and reform of the House, and how the House will reform.  We need to address matters such as the number of sitting days, what we do, how we reform what we are involved in and what meaningful contribution we can make to the general public.  That is the real challenge and debate that has to happen at some stage.<\/p> <p>An Upper House has to take power and responsibility, which must then affect what is happening in the real lives of everybody.  Today's debate involved academics and Members such as Senator Feighan, who has a background in small business, have contributed.  I am a farmer, a fact of which I am proud.  When people ask me what I do, I tell them I milk cows for a living.  That is my real job. <\/p> <p>I have been in the Chamber for the past two or three months and have raised farming issues on a continual basis.  I was elected on an agricultural platform, through the agriculture panel.  I was nominated through the Munster Agricultural Society.  In my view, that was why I was elected.  The panels need to be protected because they give a voice to various sectors.  The Parliament can give a voice to every sector.  It is a unique situation to have 60 parliamentarians in the Chamber, all of whom bring their own knowledge, experience and values to the Chamber.  We need to protect that because the intermingling of ideas and views can make a change.  The big issue is making a change after discussions have been held.  Once all of the views have been taken on board, Ministers and the Government can then make policies that suit the public.  At some stage we will have to tackle that real change.<\/p> <p>The views of councillors were mentioned.  I was a member of Cork County Council for 13 years - I was elected at 26 years of age.  Public representatives deal with issues, which they then bring to me and, in turn, I can bring them to the floor of the Chamber.  Yesterday, I raised the lack of funding for major infrastructural projects, which was debated in the chamber of Cork County Council on Monday.  There has been movement regarding funding, a matter I raised because public representatives told me it was a major issue for Cork.  I had the opportunity to ask the Minister what he was doing about it.  <\/p> <p>Today, 43 of us are elected through the councillor system.  It has its faults, but we have to protect that line of communication.  The number of Senators elected by councillors might be amended, but 13 is insufficient and will not work because we need to have a line of communication.  In many ways, this is about connecting people in local areas to the big machine in Dublin.  That is the real challenge the Chamber has to take on board in the years ahead.  <\/p> <p>I support the Bill.  It is necessary.  In my short term as a Senator, I have found that unless we change we will no longer be attached to the public.  That is the real issue.  I welcome the debate.  We will have to tease out key issues, and I look forward to that process.  Things have to happen fast.  The last thing we want is another report or review or to kick the can down the road.  We need to make a decision, move forward and take the people with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#BB00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, has already outlined in great detail our overall party position.  I want to bring a few more points to the attention of the Minister.<\/p> <p>I commend the job done by the working group on Seanad reform.  We recognise the hard work and commitment given by the group to this task.  As a party, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes a number of the recommendations the group made, in particular the proposed expansion of the electorate to those in the North and the diaspora.  We also welcome the increased provision for 30 of the 60 seats to be elected by popular vote.<\/p> <p>The Bill is a step in the right direction and we will support it.  However, we have concerns that it does not go far enough to reform the Seanad in any radical way.  I refer to a point made by Senator O'Donnell.  Any significant reform of the Seanad needs to see a systematic change in how we do our business.  I want to make two or three points in that regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sinn F&eacute;in recommended to the working group a number of areas where we feel the Seanad can take real ownership and responsibility with regard to scrutinising legislation and providing checks and balances.  One area in which this can be done is in equality proofing of budgets and legislation.  Over 60 countries have already either implemented or are working towards equality proofing budgets and legislation and the Seanad could be a real forum for such intense evaluation.  Other countries have adopted the process of equality proofing due to the wide-ranging and complex impact that legislation can have on different socio-economic groups.  The process involves working with NGOs as well as carrying out internal research to evaluate to some degree what impact legislation will have on areas such as poverty, deprivation and gender inequality.  Often legislation can be rushed, things can be over looked and, when addressing legislation, groups can have a narrow deficit management focus rather than looking at the wider implications on marginalised and minority groups.  This is where equality proofing is required.  This type of process should be an essential area of focus and is something we could all be proud to say we prioritise in the Seanad.<\/p><p>We could provide significant oversight of statutory instruments.  I have one here that was passed at the beginning of last month, which is 150 pages.  It is key legislation on public procurement.  Nobody in the D&aacute;il or Seanad has had a look at something as important as this and been able to give input into it.  It is a massive gap in the legislative oversight that we could address.  Our colleague, Senator Nash, expressed his frustration last night at the lack of oversight of statutory instruments during our statements on public procurement.  Key EU directives on public procurement have been transposed into statutory instruments without any debate in the D&aacute;il or Seanad, even though the manner and content of how they have been transposed will have significant implications on many levels, not the least on missed opportunities to enhance badly needed protections for workers and their terms and conditions.<\/p><p>Ministerial appointments are made with no consultation from anyone outside of a very small circle of individuals.  If someone is going to be appointed to a position of such significant responsibility, like housing or health, and be given an additional &euro;70,000 top-up to their Deputy's wage, that individual should be vetted by this House and scrutinised to ensure that he or she is fit for such a role.  Otherwise, an incompetent Minister could see a portfolio collapse under their watch and we would be left in a terrible state.  Is this not an area where we, in the future, could provide a check and balance?  Those are a few specific areas of scrutiny where we feel the Seanad could take some ownership and responsibility.  We are disappointed the working group did not take these suggestions on board.  However, we feel the Bill is a step in the right direction and we will be supporting it on Second Stage.<\/p><p>I will make two other points before I finish.  Reflecting on Senator Norris's comments on house painters and tradesmen, I suggest that if we had a few more working class voices in both Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps the country would not be in the huge mess it has been in for many of its 90 years of independence.  I was quite offended by that comment.  It validates the Sinn F&eacute;in position on doing away with privilege based on the amount of education a person has.  <\/p><p>My last point is a little bit negative but I have to be honest with the Minister of State.  I suspect that perhaps his Department is somewhat reluctant to embrace this reform in reality.  I hope I am wrong.  Everyone in this Chamber has contributed in a positive way today and I think everyone is very genuine.  I have a concern which I will put out there that at some point, perhaps despite all of our best intentions, this Bill will be buried.  It will be a tragedy if that were the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#BB00300","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I want to clarify that is not the issue.

I am from inner city Dublin and am proud to say I am from the tenement houses only ten minutes from here.  I come from a very working class background.  In the past ten years I have dedicated my life tirelessly to families who have been impacted by addiction.  I have set up an organisation to work with those families and I still work with them on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, that organisation does not get any Government funding.

I want to put that on record.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator McDowell for introducing this Bill and for the great work he has done on it, which is fantastic.  I was honoured to be part of the wider group of Independents in the Seanad that launched this Bill.  The Bill is the first step in ensuring the citizens of Ireland get the reform of the Seanad they asked for when they voted to keep the Upper House.  We have seen way too many reports with little follow-up action and it is when we do not act on expert advice that our fellow citizens are entitled to feel frustrated at our inaction.  While many view this Bill as not perfect, it contains the core elements of the Manning report and should form the basis of reform in this House.  Giving the public a greater say on who represents them in the Seanad is to be welcomed.  It will give wider society a stake in this House and an opportunity to influence its make-up.  I also welcome the recognition in the Manning report that our fellow citizens in the North be allowed to vote in Seanad elections as well as to passport holders overseas.  Every Irish person should be afforded a stake in their country.  I also welcome the fact that provision has been made to allow city and county councillors a continued say in the make-up of the Seanad.  Like Senator Boyhan, I completely welcome the fact that county councillors have a say in this.  During my election campaign, I met with many hardworking, articulate and passionate councillors who worked tirelessly to better their communities.  Their voices should he heard, their opinions listened to and their expertise of on-the-ground issues acted upon.  Ensuring they have a continued voice in this House is paramount to its success.  <\/p> <p>The opportunity before us today is not just one of how this House is elected, but one that can ensure we influence the role and powers of this House.  The working group clearly recognises the role of this House as being one whose primary function is the scrutiny, amendment and initiation of legislation.  We should, however, continue to expand its remit to include the other recommendations such as giving consideration to North-South Ministerial Council proposals; giving consideration to secondary legislation of the EU; consulting with relevant bodies prior to and during Second Stage debate; investigating and reporting on matters of public policy interest; and considering reports from regulators and other statutory inspectors.  These recommendations and the implementation of this Bill will ensure this House is elected more democratically and also have a more robust role in shaping the future of our country in a way that is more relevant to our fellow citizens.  I have no doubt there will be resistance to this reform, as there has been in the past, but we have nothing to fear from change and I welcome the commitment of all parties to this Bill.  I am delighted that we are at last listening to the will of the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#CC00500","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Senator Dolan is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#CC00600","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>How much time do I have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#CC00700","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The Senator has over four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#CC00800","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Do not tell me that; I might use it.

We can start teasing out the tension between various ideas and worries that people have then.  There is a tension about the members of local authorities.  Like Senator Black, I had my eyes opened going around and talking to councillors, particularly in the area of disability.

There is something wrong with the idea, even in Tipperary, that in this day and age one could be running in an election that is almost a secret election.  I sat in a caf&eacute; in Portlaoise one day while travelling from one county council to another and saw people coming and going with their children.

There is no reason for that; it is just a fact but where else could one have heard a concerted voice or voices around that issue that is directly from that movement or from other civil society movements?<\/p><p>I want to mention something that is somewhat ironic.  There was frequently much criticism of past Governments that they did deals with the social partners outside the gates of these Houses.  I was involved in social partnership as a disability interest in the community and voluntary pillar.  There were 17 organisations in it and we managed to keep it someway coherent, so things are possible.  At that time, before the environment pillar was brought in just before everything collapsed here, we had farmers, employers, trade unions and the social services sector.  Is that not four of the five panels that we have here now?  We had people in here saying Government was doing deals on the outside that nobody knew about and a House that was designed to have characters with some knowledge and experience sitting down in committees, working through issues and being able to say to directly elected politicians, \"That is fine, Tim, but let me tell you how things sometimes work in practice\".  People could then tear through the process.  If we do that we will get better legislation and better follow-up and prosecution of what happens after legislation is passed.<\/p><p>Coming back to the members of local authorities, I am fairly sure there are issues regarding their role that might need to be sorted out independently but in parallel with what we want to do here.  We should not try to stuff issues, so to speak.  If it does not fit, do not try to make it fit.  There is useful work to be done.  We have now a massive civil society across all the domains which did not exist to any extent in 1937.  It exists now.  It is diverse, and we are idiots if we do not find ways to bring that directly into these Houses.  That is the big value for money exercise we can do for our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#CC00900","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Like my Fine Gael colleagues, I support the Bill, certainly in principle.

In the context of this debate, we have frequently mentioned the importance of our local representatives who are working on local issues and meeting local people every day.  It is critical that we connect with those local representatives because it is only by knowing local issues that we will be able to effect change at national level.  We must keep the link between the Seanad and local representatives.  They need a voice at national level.  Currently, we are that voice and we must continue to be that voice.  I strongly believe that we need to keep the chain between the Seanad and our councils.  As Senator Lombard mentioned, many issues raised in the council chamber must be addressed at national level, and I fully support our strong relationship with local representatives who do a very good job within their respective areas.<\/p> <p>I have been a Member for only a number of weeks but the two major challenges I would see, as mentioned frequently today, is the functioning of the Seanad and how we get our message across in terms of what we are trying to work on and how the people can further engage with us.  Much of the discussion has been on widening the electorate.  I am not fully convinced that widening the electorate will have a major impact on how we function as a Seanad, how the general public engages with the Seanad and how we engage with the general public.  That needs to be further considered on Committee Stage in terms of widening the electorate.  The core principle of Seanad reform needs to be with regard to functioning, which has been raised by a number of Senators in the course of this debate.<\/p> <p>I was privileged in the sense that I was a Trinity graduate, but nobody is better than anybody else.  Everybody is equal to everybody else.  That is how it should be, and it is important that all graduates of third level institutions would have an ability to vote.  The overall sense is that there is significant need for modernisation.  We are now in the 21st century and we need to move away from elitism.  We talk about equal opportunity.  That needs to be reflected in this Seanad.<\/p> <p>It is useful that the Minister of State, Deputy English, addressed the House today and focused on actions because at this stage that is what we need to see in terms of earmarking potential difficulties that may arise with regard to cost and the operational working of widening an electorate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maura Hopkins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senators, we must be aware of that in the context of the Bill's proceeding to Committee Stage.

We welcome that any diaspora will be given that opportunity.  Graduates from any university would also have the opportunity to vote, and it is important we do not distinguish between institutions.<\/p> <p>When we speak about reform, it is important to recognise the good work that goes on within the Chamber.  Sometimes it is politically beneficial in some people's eyes to knock the system, but I acknowledge all the people elected to the Chamber through the years.  Many of them have been here for some time.  I acknowledge the work they have done during their time and it is important for all of us to recognise it.

It is quite severe.  It could be argued that when we consider democracy at any level - the Upper House, the Lower House or locally - local government definitely needs a spotlight.  There is nobody closer to the people than county councillors, as they live among the people seven days per week.  They represent all sorts of people from every aspect of society.  We will seek an amendment to the proposal in question.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris referred earlier to house painters, etc.  I am reminded of the song with the line, \"All God's creatures have a place in the choir.\"  Perhaps I should sing a few verses to him before the day is out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#EE00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Go for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#EE00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Senator might not say that once I get past the first few lines.

That is important, and perhaps it is disappointing the Manning report did not focus on that particular aspect of our work.  I emphasise that there has been some serious good work done here and I have no doubt about the bona fides of everybody elected to the Seanad.  I have no doubt they will do a good job.  There is no issue with how they will look in the mirror and see how things can be done differently.  It is important that we and every organisation do that.<\/p> <p>We should not rush the process.

I extend my apologies for not being in the Chamber for all the debate but I followed a bit of it in the office between meetings.  It is a sincere debate and we must be inward-looking in the first instance because we have the privilege of being elected to the Chamber and a responsibility as a result.  Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the abolition of the Seanad has been well known, but the people expressed in a very democratic fashion that it was not their wish to see the Seanad abolished.  We must adhere to the democratic wish as laid out with respect to this institution as the Upper House in the Oireachtas and what people expect from us.  They expect a strong and robust Seanad in scrutinising legislation, representing people and giving voice to citizens right across the board, particularly those who find themselves on the margins or removed from the government process.<\/p> <p>We have a broad remit and I am sure that, historically, it has been frustrating for Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; that the process has not been as forthright as they may have wanted.  There are important roles laid out for the Seanad and the Bill could compliment those, strengthening the role of the Seanad and its Members as we move forward.  It is good to hear the different views around that and how we can deal with the nuances of this legislation and the role of the Upper House.<\/p> <p>I am very encouraged by the new section, touched on by the previous speaker, that would allow the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens in the North.  It is a very positive move.  Maybe I am as guilty as anybody else in focusing on issues when we should consider modest and routine mechanisms.  I am encouraged by this and anything that moves to enfranchise Irish citizens, regardless of where they are on the island, giving them a very direct input, influence and sense of ownership of this place, the institutions and the legislation and work flowing through it.  That is a very positive step forward.  Almost 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement, it is about time that this happened.  I say that respectfully.<\/p> <p>Belfast City Council is probably the second biggest council on the island.  It has 60 members and represents the second city.  It has a very diverse and ever-changing make-up.  The role of elected councillors and local government members is something that could be considered as the legislation moves forward, with amendments.  We can see the positive work that occurs between local government authorities across the island, including in the Border counties, where the work is critical.  We can also consider the eastern corridor and the connection between Belfast and Dublin.  A memorandum of understanding exists between the councils there and along the corridor.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I believe there is massive potential to have the voice of those members in an institution like this to give oversight to the legislation that comes before us and to allow for greater initiation of legislation that would strengthen co-operation, economic growth, social inclusion and regeneration right across the island.  Our position on this Bill has been laid out by the previous speakers.  We have our amendments and our own view of how to improve the Bill.  I hope that the amendments will be taken in the sincere way that they are offered for other Senators' consideration.  We have an ideal opportunity here.  We have a unique opportunity to finally do something with Seanad &Eacute;ireann that makes us much more relevant, accessible, democratic and reflective of our society.<\/p><p>One of the previous speakers spoke about nobody being closer to the people than local councillors.  That is a fair enough assessment, but I would contest that there is nobody closer to the people than the people themselves.

I congratulate him on his reappointment as Minister of State and his appointment to this area.  I know he will bring great energy and natural ability to the role.  I wish him well in it.  This is one of his major challenges.  It is an important challenge.  I also congratulate Senator McDowell on bringing forward the legislation.  I congratulate my old friend and teacher of a few years ago, Maurice Manning, who in many respects is very responsible for the legislation as well.  As my colleagues have all said, we are supporting the legislation in principle and in its full spirit.  Naturally, we will be proposing amendments and examining it.  That is what this important process is there to do.  I hope that there will be much of that in the House.<\/p> <p>When we talk about reform, change and all of that, it is important to acknowledge the past and what has been achieved.  It might be no harm as a backdrop to acknowledge once again that the Irish Seanad of this Republic has been an enormous success.  It has been a success historically in one very important sphere and regard.  I am very conscious of this as a Border person.  It gave expression, identity and provided a Chamber to which those who are broadly described as southern Unionists could relate.  That is not a fair term.  It is the Protestant community of the various Protestant churches of the Republic.  In the formation and the earlier stages of the State, that community looked to this Chamber as its voice and medium.  It was a very important factor in achieving political stability and political buy-in and to normalising the difficult birth of the nation.  It was a difficult stage at the outset but the Seanad provided an important Chamber in that regard.  That voice was very important.  That merits acknowledgement.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan and other Senators has gone through the list in more depth.  I will avoid naming names on this occasion, but the Seanad has had many distinguished former Members and many more ordinary people who served in it and did wonderful work.  Even from my own constituency, I can think of two particular former Members.  It occurs to me as apt to acknowledge them given that Senator Wilson is in the chair at the moment.  Two people from County Cavan who served in this Chamber with distinction before Senator Wilson and I were former Senators S&eacute;amus Dolan and Andy O'Brien.  The former Senator O'Brien's family are still involved in politics in the county with great distinction.  He made an enormous contribution to this House.  He brought a very particular humour to it and a great quality and incisiveness to examining legislation.  The former Senator Dolan became Cathaoirleach and was a distinguished Cathaoirleach of this Chamber.  He ultimately became a member of the Council of State.  There was also former Senator Baxter from our own county as well who made a real contribution.  His daughter is still involved in the civil society and public life of our county.<\/p> <p>I accept and understand the principle of a wider franchise.  We have to accept the principle of a wider franchise and the concept of one person, one vote.  That is a maxim and it has to be accepted.  I am concerned that there is great potential that the whole proposal for dealing with that is quite woolly and all over the shop.  It has the potential for abuse, whether it is through the online registration or abuse by political parties.  If we are claiming that the current Seanad suffers from abuse by political parties - and implicitly that is the proposition - I believe the new system significantly lends itself to that potential abuse.  If we consider ourselves to be dealing with an ailment in the body politic at the moment, we would want to make sure that the cure is better than the disease.  Great caution is needed.  The Minister of State has an insight and his initial remarks suggest that he has identified the difficulty.  I say to him that we need to take great caution in the methodologies, the registration processes, in how people register and in all other areas of potential abuse.  The mind boggles at the kind of ideas that could affect these processes, particularly online abuse.  It needs major thought and work.<\/p> <p>I understand the point made by Senator Norris on the reform of the nominating bodies and I accept that there is potential in that area.  Again, we have to watch that it is carefully done.  That is a very important point.  Before I leave his remarks, I must acknowledge that Senator Norris made a valid point.  It might sound somewhat elitist and it is not from my own perspective, but I would not like us to totally extinguish the university input and the university constituency that attained expression in the Seanad after feeling that it was not always gaining expression in our popular Chamber.  We must be careful.  I have a certain sympathy with the points the Senator made.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has a background as a council member in Meath and I know anecdotally that he has a great friendship with his councillors.  It is very important that we do not make our councillors feel totally alienated and disenfranchised in this process.  They enjoyed this participation and felt that this was their link to the Oireachtas.  I think that limiting their numbers to 13 is a bit extreme and should be looked at on Committee Stage.  The election of the other 30 will present logistical difficulties and would need amendment on Committee Stage in terms of regional structures.<\/p> <p>The whole issue is about how we do this.  The concept, the principle and the motivation are good and the ambition is visionary.  All of that is in order.  However, I am not convinced - I am yet to see evidence otherwise - that we are not at risk of putting a new structure in place that will be open to greater abuse and be much more difficult to manage.  The whole thing needs very careful thought.  I would like to have time to develop how we look at the management of the House and how we structure our business but that is not today's business.  We support this Bill in principle but I think it will need very significant and careful scrutiny on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#FF00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and commend Senator McDowell and the group which has brought it before us.  I am not a cynical person.  We have been here before several times and perhaps this might be the legislation that effects real reform of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>We are very fortunate to have an opportunity to discuss Seanad reform because had the Taoiseach in the last Administration his way, we would not be here to discuss reform.  It is to the credit of Senator McDowell and former Senators like Joe O'Toole and Dr. Maurice Manning, and their interventions in the debate, that we were able to retain the Seanad in its present form.  Those of us who were incumbents at the time and argued for the retention of the Seanad, to paraphrase the clich&eacute;, were like turkeys trying to get an injunction against Christmas.  That was the amount of credibility that we had.  Therefore, I am very thankful to Senator McDowell and others for the cogent arguments they put forward.<\/p> <p>It is very heartening to note that when the people of Ireland were given the opportunity in no uncertain terms less than one fifth of the population voted to abolish the Seanad.  The result gave the Taoiseach food for thought.  I hope it will be the last attempt by the Taoiseach and his party to launch an attack on democratic institutions.  <\/p> <p>I have great friends in Fine Gael but the party has some kind of a primordial atavistic impulse because every now and again it gets a rush of blood to the head and wants to change democracy around.  If anything is associated in any shape or form with the name Eamon de Valera, Fine Gael has an awful loathing and hates it so much that it just cannot leave it alone.  Of course, the Seanad was invented by Eamon de Valera.  There is no doubt that he was an extraordinary genius whatever one thinks of him.  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the deliberations took place that gave rise to this system.  I suppose no notes were kept in those days.  I do know that it took some work to come up with this particular system.<\/p> <p>In the main the Seanad has served its purpose fairly well.  It gave a platform to minority viewpoints at a time when it was very important, which was after the formation of the State.  As has been stated here, the Seanad gave a political platform to some of the most eminent people in public life.  I shall not list the pantheon again.  We have had some of the most accomplished politicians, orators and business people, and people from all walks of life have had an opportunity to have their voices heard in this Chamber where they may not have had that opportunity in any other way. <\/p> <p>The one big issue of reform is the system of election.  It is the real nub of this and all other reform attempts.  It is about who elects whom.  There are faults in the three subsections.  Democracy is not served well when there is a Chamber in which 11 Members out of 60 are nominated by one person, no matter how eminent that person is.  I have the highest respect for the position of Taoiseach but I do not think the option is right and proper.  I do not propose an amendment to this Bill but my party will table amendments on Committee Stage.  I commend my party and my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, for being the only one in the last debate who took the tough decision to support the Seanad.  My party will table amendments but I am not sure what form they will take at this point.  I have reservations about the idea that the Taoiseach can appoint 11 Senators. <\/p> <p>I am conscious of the mote in my eye, which I shall come to, but I shall now look at the university situation.  Clearly, it is totally unfair, undemocratic and elitist.  It debars a certain number of university graduates.  Why should university graduates, above all other sectors of society, have a vote in the Seanad?  What makes a university graduate, of which I am one, a better person to elect a Senator than a housewife, a garda, a person working for himself or herself or an employee?  The provision is the most elitist and we must examine it closely.  <\/p> <p>I cannot be objective about having 43 seats because I have been fortunate enough to have been returned here three times by the county councillors of Ireland.  If we are not going to have indirect election then we are talking about direct election, that means another D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I do not think anybody wants Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be another D&aacute;il.  For God's sake, one D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is enough.  Instead we want an alternative.  If it is not going to be an alternative then let us not have it at all.<\/p> <p>If indirect election is going to be part of the system then nobody is better equipped to constitute the electorate, or a sizeable portion of it, than the county councillors of Ireland because they have a mandate from the people.  Every county councillor must reach a quota or get elected at any rate.  The average first preference vote of an elected councillor is in the order of 1,500.  The quota when I stood for election to for Kerry County Council was 2,200.  It is not an inconceivable achievement to get that number of votes in one's own county and local people are the best judge of who they want to put forward.  It is a tiered structure but we are not talking about just any 1,000 people.  We are talking about 1,000 people who have come through the system, earned the trust of their neighbours and people, and also have a need and a requirement to have access to the Oireachtas in the same way county councillors have at the moment through us, the Senators.  That aspect should be protected and I note that the Bill acknowledges same.<\/p> <p>As Senator O'Reilly has said, the idea of reducing the number of seats elected in this manner from 43 to 13 is swingeing and uncalled for.  If one must make changes then increase the number of seats in the Seanad.  I do not see why it should be set in stone that there should be 60 seats.<\/p> <p>That is basically all I have to say about the legislation at the moment.  It is a good Bill and it is well structured.  With the new politics that we have at the moment there is every chance the Bill might succeed and the best of luck to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#GG00100","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Due to the fact that this debate is longer than the usual time set aside for statements, and there is more flexibility in terms of who speaks and for how long, I ended up in the Chamber for a lot longer this afternoon than intended.

It is not necessarily our decision to make and might be one for the other House.  I feel that I have an absolute duty to fulfil the responsibility of this House to the best of my ability and will always seek to represent everyone as best I can.<\/p> <p>Very many people have passed through this House.  A lot of people in the Chamber are a lot more experienced in politics, public life and other careers than I am.  It has been humbling to see the names of the people who have passed through this House.  I will not list them but I will mention one name.  A couple of days after my election I received a telephone call from the principal of my former secondary school.  Over the years we have remained close and I always ask him about issues in my local area.  The school is located in the same area that I represented as a councillor and he had a good grasp of the many issues that faced the education sector.  When he rang we had a general chat but I was struck by his final question.  He asked me did I know the name of the last Senator who went to his school.  I replied that I did not have a clue who it was and he informed me that it was Gordon Wilson.  Many people may not know Gordon Wilson, especially now.  To me, he is a legend in terms of the peace process, because of the way he handled himself in the wake of the horrible murder of his daughter and for the way he represented a very small niche community on this island.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Neale Richmond:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He called himself a Southern Unionist from County Leitrim.  He attended the school I attended in Dublin and the fact that my name will go up on the board beside his is something I have not been able to get my head around.  I respect and admire all those who have served in this Chamber, as well as all of the speakers in this debate.  I fundamentally disagree, however, with the views of some Members on the Bill and many of the issues that have been raised.  I hope I have not been too backward in making this known, but I hope I do not fall out with anybody and that things will be fine in the end.<\/p><p>This is a good Bill.  I am yet to be wholly convinced that we need a second House of Parliament, but I am open to being convinced.  I like the idea that we are looking at realistic reform, but the problem is that there is no right or wrong answer.  Everyone's definition of reform is completely different.  Whatever people like to say, the suggestion made by the previous Government, as blunt it was, that we move from a bicameral to an unicameral democracy was an effort at reform.  I say fair play to it, as it went and did something about the matter.  I would say that, however, as a member of a Government party.  <\/p><p>The Upper House has been subject of so many reports, motions and Bills that one can completely understand the general public's level of frustration, as well as that of elected public representatives, at the fact that nothing ever seems to change.  We can always talk about political and Seanad reform, but, ultimately, one will never please everyone.  In fact, one may fail to please the majority.  However, if one is of the opinion that the House, in its current form, is no longer fit for purpose, one has to do something.  When the House was established in the 1930s, as Senator David Norris and others said, it was meant to be a refuge for members of the Southern Unionist community.  On the last count, subject to correction, three Members of the Houses were members of the Church of Ireland and happy to say so.  Only one was elected from the Trinity College Dublin panel - the best of luck to him - but there is no need for this exception to be continued in the Constitution.  We have moved so far in our role as an independent and sovereign state that catering for small minorities is not as necessary within a specific House of Parliament, but it is something to be considered in the future.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Michael McDowell for his efforts.  He has been consistent on this issue.  He was extremely vocal during the referendum campaign.  It was also a role played by many in civic society.  In this context, I would like to mention Mr. Derek Mooney of Democracy Matters who campaigned for retention of the Seanad and who has been in deep contact with me about many things.  It was Democracy Matters that convinced the majority to retain the institution of the Seanad.  In turn, it is its responsibility to indicate what its believes would be real reform of the House.  I am happy to support it and see the Manning report being brought to fruition.  I hope we will see meaningful reform and change but also democracy in this Chamber, one of the merits of which is the respect shown for dissenting views and the opportunity given to speak honestly and openly.  I have absolutely no problem in saying that not only did I vote for abolition of the Seanad but that ideally I would rather be in the D&aacute;il.  In the way our democracy functions the D&aacute;il has more power, plays a more direct role and has the ability to influence the lives of ordinary people.  I do not see the Seanad as a cr&egrave;che, a stepping stone, a retirement house or as a last refuge but as the second House of Parliament.  Whether I serve for much longer or will be chosen as a candidate to run for the D&aacute;il - that decision rests with the party - I will rate my time in this Chamber, however long it may be, very highly.  I appreciate the opportunity and the honour to serve in it.  I do not want to take away from the honour that it is to serve in it by the fact that in all honesty I would like to be somewhere else.  I like to envisage that I will have a political career.  Anyone who states he or she has a level of ambition has it knocked out.  Let us be honest and not hide behind woolly language.  If one believes in something, one should say it.<\/p><p>Like Senator Joe O'Reilly, I, too, wish to refer briefly to Dr. Maurice Manning.  If it was not for him, I would not have such an interest in politics and I would not have become involved in it.  There is a fair chance I would not have voted for, let alone joined, the Fine Gael Party.  I have no family ties with politics.  As a first year arts student in UCD, Dr. Manning's lectures were the highlight of my academic week and attended by students not taking the course.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill and look forward to contributing to the debate on Committee and Remaining Stages.  I thank Members for contributing and appreciate the respect shown to all Members.  I look forward to working with Members across the House to further the aims of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#GG00400","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Keogh to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#HH00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>As I said previously, I do not come from a political background.  I am talking, therefore, from a position of complete innocence.  To be absolutely honest, before Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin nominated me to be a Member, my view of the Seanad was exactly how some people had described it.  I did not think it held political sway and that the voice of the people would be heard.  That was partly due to my own ignorance and I should have looked further at the matter.<\/p> <p>When Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin discussed the nomination with me, he said I would be the voice for those with mental health issues.  All of a sudden, the process opened up for me.  I actually thought it was wonderful.  It means that people can speak about the real issues that affect them and the country.  As Members know, the political parties spoke about mental health services in their manifestoes, but, unfortunately, that is where it starts and ends.  I thought that being a Member of the Seanad would help in highlighting mental health issues.<\/p> <p>The reason I am supporting the Bill is simply I believe in democracy.  What concerns me about the 43 Members elected by councillors and the elected members of the different political parties is that they are the voices of their parties.  The only reason I agreed to accept the nomination to be a Member of the Seanad was I knew that mine would be an independent voice.  We need to represent the people.  Unfortunately - this is an observation and not a criticism - for many Members who were not elected to the D&aacute;il, this was their second choice.  I am really sad about this, as we are being given an opportunity to do something really powerful.  Allowing the people to vote for Senators is the only way to go.  I am new and still finding my feet.  Therefore, there are many things I still do not know, even the language used.  As a result, I may on occasion talk through my ears.  <\/p> <p>I back Senator Michael McDowell's Bill 100% because I know that, in order to develop as a country and a society, we always need to look at change.

Certainly that is democracy at work.  Having been elected through four local elections I consider I have a mandate from the electorate.  While I may have been elected by councillors and fellow councillors, Deputies and Senators, the reduction to 13 is very small given that we have 900 representatives between councillors, Deputies and Senators around the country.  I have regular contact from colleagues in the council but also from my electorate.  Recently I opened an office in Limerick and a number of people have come to me with issues that I am delighted to bring to this Chamber.  That shows democracy as it works.  That the number of seats for councillors may be reduced to 11 is much too small and needs to be looked at.  I welcome the fact that the intention is to introduce voting rights to all third level institutions.  I have served on the boards of the University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology.  We also have Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.  I speak from a local interest point of view and currently none of those people has a vote.  <\/p><p>The Seanad has played a positive role over many years and many people consider it the watchdog.  Bills which come through the D&aacute;il are considered in the Seanad.  That we have contact from people outside this Chamber and that we represent their views is positive.  We went out to the public and it had its say and the Seanad is still here.  I agree that some parts of the workings of the House have to be made more relevant.  Certainly many positive issues are debated here and should receive support.  We have been sitting for the past three or four weeks.  During that time we had a debate on tourism.  We have had the Minister for Health and the Minister with responsibility for roads come before the House and Members have raised relevant topics.

On a serious note, there is no doubt this is substantial legislation.  Change is needed, nobody disputes that.  We are all aware of that.  Some very good measures have been proposed, such as the diaspora having a voice and possibly an all-Ireland vote.  As I have stated here the people have already spoken in respect of the Seanad.  The people voted and elected to keep it.  I am not sure if the way forward is to massively change its format.<\/p> <p>I come from a councillor background having been a county councillor for seven years and a member of Mullingar Town Council for five years until the brain wave to get rid of town councils.  That has been a serious backward step for local politics and towns up and down the country.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and Fianna F&aacute;il have talked about reintroducing town councils.  That is one of their proposals under local government and the local government review.  The policy programme Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government, was published in 2012 and abolished town councils.  In some cases it gave councillors substantially larger areas to cover at greater expense involving a greater amount of time.  The cost in terms of time was phenomenal.  There were half the number of councillors as heretofore and the amount of work, as many members can testify having been in that circuit, doubled overnight when town councils were eliminated.  Putting People First was going to give much power to councillors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aidan Davitt:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have heard it referred to as being sold a pup, but to be sold a whole litter of them was really the trick.  The cut of powers and the diminution of all that was good about county councils was incredible.  When I started off, one had certain powers in planning which were taken away under Putting People First.  In my county, refuse collection services were taken away.  The \"in thing\" to do was to remove refuse collection services.<\/p><p>The number of housing bodies I know the Minister deals with on a daily basis is incredible.  I believe there are upwards of 1,000 housing bodies operating in Ireland, many of which are sitting on banks of money and currently twiddling their thumbs.  In fairness, the Minister is making a great fist of trying to tackle this situation and to move it along.  I have recently seen the new approach regarding housing and how the Minister has worked hands-on in a couple of different projects in my own county on which I commend him.  Consider, however, all the powers that have been taken away.  From the time I was in Westmeath, there have been many roads subsumed into the National Roads Authority.  Putting a sign up to advertise a business on a road became incredibly difficult.  I have a feeling we are going in the same direction.  I will not even get into our friends in Irish Water, but I have a serious feeling that we are heading in the same direction with this Bill.<\/p><p>I welcome the legislation because I believe we want to see change but many of the councillors' powers have been taken away and now we are about to take another one of their powers, which is their link to national politics.  If a councillor has a national problem, he or she can lift the phone to their local Deputy.  Nine out of ten times the Deputy will not want to hear from the councillor because he or she is looking out for their seat, or they may want to do something else or are looking at the bigger picture.  In general, a Senator is not in that space.  I can attest to this from my experience with great Senators from my area over the years, including former Senators Donie Cassidy and Mary O'Rourke, who are both former Leaders of the House, former Senator and Deputy, the late Nicky McFadden - God rest her - who was the sister of Senator Gabrielle McFadden, and Senator Camillus Glynn.  All of these people were super Senators and any councillor could lift the phone to them at any hour of the day or night to discuss a problem, be it medical cards, passports, national roads or any concerns they had.  The Senators could deal with them and get an answer at a national level.  It was a great help to us as councillors.<\/p><p>I am curious about one particular part of the legislation with which I would disagree.  As I have outlined, the main element of this Bill that may need to be changed appears to be the nominations by councillors.  The Taoiseach's 11 nominees remain and the six from Trinity College Dublin and the National Universities of Ireland are also still there.  If it is not possible for the national university nominations to be changed, could the Taoiseach's number be changed?  They were originally intended to ensure power in the Upper House rested with the Government.  However, even with those numbers, that is not currently the case and it probably will not happen going forward with modern politics as they stand.  It makes for a redundant argument.  With the university selected Members, those of us who were came through the vocational panel know that every vote was worth 1,000.  Maybe there is some way the university panels could nominate their people and because every vote is worth 1,000 votes, their vote could be some sort of equalisation in an election with the councillors' vote having a heavier weight.  Perhaps this could be examined.  Do I have one minute remaining?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#JJ01200","speaker":"1411","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#KK00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I propose that we adjourn the debate until an approximate time in the autumn when I hope we can finish it.

People have said there are other areas of greater need such as unemployment which is a massive issue, as are health and social provision.  There are also issues with income and poverty experienced by people with disabilities.  Why put the focus on housing at this time?  There is constant talk from Government on what I would describe as the housing crisis, underscored by references to a dedicated Ministry for housing, the Minister's own Department, the cross-party committee and its recent report, all of which emphasise that this is the priority for the Government. <\/p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, the current recession-rent housing situation is an absolute crisis and requires urgent attention and action.  I understand and support that, as do people with disabilities.  I too see children coming and going from hotels.  That is heartbreaking and has to be dealt with.  I am happy to say there is strong interest in the issue of housing for people with disabilities.  Many Members come from disability backgrounds such as the deaf community, blind, mental health and neurological, physical and intellectual disabilities.  Housing is a big issue right across the disability and mental health area.<\/p><p>What is unacceptable is the implicit acceptance that it is the only housing crisis in Ireland.  We have a new housing crisis which is rightly attracting necessary attention.  I am here to give voice, to garner support and action for the long-running housing crisis in Ireland, a housing crisis that has deep roots in the culture of exclusion and lack of expectation.  I am here to give the Minister the opportunity to set out publicly what is being done to resolve this historic crisis in parallel with the other crisis that has to be dealt with.  The current crisis is based on the rightful notion that people have an obvious need for a house to live in, otherwise expressed as a right to housing.  <\/p><p>The journey begins in a very different place for people with disabilities, that place being institutional and separate settings.  Ireland still has almost 3,000 people living in congregated settings and many others, unnecessarily, living in nursing homes.  There is a deep-seated culture that it is acceptable that disabled people would live in an institution without giving their consent and with others whom they have not chosen to live with.  It has been said that one cannot choose the people one works with but one can choose one's friends.  Many people with disabilities still do not have the assurance that they can choose the people with whom to live or that their house will support them to live with ease and comfort with their loved ones.<\/p><p>I will refer to people trying to continue living in the community.  We are often reminded that the policy is to keep people living and participating in the community.  We must not forget that it has always been the determined will and resolve of people with disabilities to make the case, always against the odds, to have their space in society, to win that space and to try and hold on to it.  It has not been easy to do that in the past few years.  They fought and struggled for inclusion to drive a regular car, attend regular school, go to the same workplace as others, to get on the same bus and train; in other words to be able to live independently.  When the disabled person's grant was introduced in 1992 that too was fought for by people with disabilities.  <\/p><p>In 1980, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report No. 50 stated that the existing grant was totally out of line with building costs and should be reviewed annually or automatically linked to building costs.  It went on to say that the housing adaptation scheme, progressive as it was at the conception stage, suffered from difficulties with implementation.  It named three of these areas: differing interpretations; geographical location; and the many delays not linked with the costs of adapting houses.  It concluded that an effective housing policy must involve three elements: a satisfactory adaptation scheme; provision within the building programme; and housing with support services where needed.  At that time, more than 30 years ago, shortcomings were identified.  This was a first strong effort at retrofitting, a scheme to ensure that people could stay living in the community.<\/p><p>In 2004, NESC returned to that subject in its Housing in Ireland Performance and Policy report No. 112.  In respect of housing issues for people with disabilities, it quoted from a Disability Federation of Ireland document which stated that changes to the disabled person's housing grant, including the introduction of means testing and the reduction of individual amounts payable had led to increased vulnerability for disabled persons, often at crisis points, including over-long stays in hospitals and inadequate standards of housing, and a limited range of housing options.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->During 2004, at the height of the Celtic tiger, a NESC document pointed out that there were risks.  In 2006, the NDA published a review of the disabled person's grant scheme, which stated: \"It ... documents the variety of eligibility criteria, assessment procedures and application processes which have been developed across local authorities and which have created anomalies and inequalities in the provision of the grant.\"  It also set out difficulties with the operation of the grant, such as delays in occupational therapy assessments and inadequate grant levels.  Sadly, it must now be said that a scheme first introduced in 1972 is still under-funded and under-ambitious, leaving so many people and families without access to the most basic of rights, which is a functioning and comfortable home.<\/p><p>We see on an annual basis the routine closing down of the application process for the housing adaptation scheme across our local authorities.  If we were in the work arena, it would now be enshrined as \"custom and practice\".  That is what it has become.  This is something that routinely happens every spring to summer, and so the conversation for every new applicant commences with \"We have run out of money.  Come back again.\"  How obscene and wrong it is to present people in dire and immediate need of something so basic with that routine notion and a stop-start implementation, administration and funding process?  How is it okay to send people away not once or twice because there was a crisis, but every year?  It is the custom and practice regarding how this programme operates.  <\/p><p>I met many city and county councillors during the Seanad election campaign and I was so impressed with the commitment and resolve of many of them in respect of the housing and other needs of people with disabilities.  Yet they are also frustrated that they cannot support people, who are often their neighbours, to get the necessary housing adaptations in a timely fashion and that others cannot move into a house so that they can progress as adults and get on with their lives.  Councillors spend so much time keeping faith with people in the slim hope that there will be a good result, but never a timely one.  So many family members and people across the disability and housing sectors put in much time and effort, as do public officials, but it is such a poor and frustrating use of time.  The phrase \"get on with your life\" is certainly a clich&eacute;, but it is well packed with the essence of what a house can do for somebody.  It is the keystone of the possibility of getting on with one's life and having the opportunity to strike out as a person in one's own right with whomever one wishes to live with.  We all instinctively know this, yet almost 50 years on from Ireland's first response to the housing needs of people with disabilities, we are no way near providing the housing response that is required.  <\/p><p>To put it very directly to the Minister, this is as much a housing crisis as the awful current crisis, and we must bring the same resolve and response to solving it.  That is the commitment, which is the only commitment that is acceptable.  I know that people with disabilities are confounded by the notion that there is only one housing crisis in Ireland at present, because that is all they hear about in the public space.  All those waiting for and needing home adaptations - 4,000 people waiting for social housing, and almost 3,000 people who are still in institutions, along with their families and carers - cannot accept the dominant notion that there is only one housing crisis in Ireland for one group of people, and I hope we can deal with that notion here this afternoon.  There is no doubt that that is totally unacceptable as well.  People with disabilities and their families see themselves airbrushed out of consideration.  It is not too strong to say that they are being pushed aside as the political oxygen only seems to permeate the recent crisis.  The message being picked up by people with disabilities and their organisations is, \"We are used to waiting so we can wait longer.\"  This waiting cannot go on any longer.  There must be a strong start that people can see resulting in new housing provision and stepped-up output on housing adaptations in the year ahead.  This urgently requires funding.<\/p><p>The programme for a partnership Government states that the needs of people with disabilities will be incorporated into all future housing policies and acknowledges that by 2021 there will still be 1,817 people in congregated settings.  If the speed of dealing with this issue remains the same, it will take another decade.  These are not statements of resolve and statements to challenge civil servants.  We need to see the targets.  There are some in respect of congregated settings.  Processes are in place and I have acknowledged them in the motion, so there is something very strong to build on.  We now need strong and definite targets and outcomes.  I am saying clearly that this issue needs to be resolved over the next three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#NN00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I second the motion.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important motion and I urge all Senators to come on board and allow it to pass today.   I thank Senator Dolan for introducing the motion, which is based on his considerable professional expertise.  Regrettably, I was unable to speak earlier on the Seanad Bill, but I do want to briefly note that it is this kind of first-hand knowledge that the Members of this House often bring to debates.  It is an indispensable feature, and long may it continue on the road to Seanad reform.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan outlined very comprehensively the difficulties that persist for people with a disability in accessing the housing they need.  It is telling that at no point in our history, either in times of plenty or in times of austerity, has the State been able to guarantee that its citizens living with a disability will be as free to pursue living to their maximum potential, as is the case for those who do not have a disability.  At its core, this is an issue of equality.  When we fully appreciate the lengths we still have to go to ensure that this equality can be guaranteed to all in terms of housing provision, the kind of policy making we need from the Government becomes clear.  We need thinking that is forward-thinking rather than reactive, inclusive rather than excluding, holistic rather than piecemeal and consultative rather than dictated.  That is the standard by which we should seek to disability-proof our housing policy.  It is the standard that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities challenges us to meet.  Indeed, what better metaphor than house building can we use when looking for ways to describe how our policy should be?  We need to get the design and construction right at the outset and we will then end up with a durable structure that is capable of accommodating all. <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, we are far from the ideal scenario.  While this motion seeks the kind of paradigm shift in thinking that we need on disability, it also recommends some helpful measures that can be taken in the short to medium term that could go a long way towards meeting the housing needs of those with disabilities.  In particular, I urge the Government to take seriously the recommendation that a reserved amount of Part V housing be constructed to meet the needs of people with disabilities, the funding increase sought for adaptation grants and the requirement for greater efficiencies in implementation.  We also must recognise that there are different levels of support required depending on the nature of a person&rsquo;s disability, and this must be reflected in the type of accommodation constructed or made available so that it is always fit for purpose.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In the past three decades, charities and organisations devoted to assisting those with housing needs often purchased low-quality homes that required significant retrofitting to be made liveable.  Local authorities have been doing the same.  That represents a serious cost when compared to the cost of getting it right at the get-go, not only for charities and the State but also for residents who must live in poorly insulated homes.  Many people living with a disability find themselves disproportionately in fuel poverty, so this represents an extra burden.<\/p><p>We must get this right.  When homes are being built we need to ensure that a certain percentage are built to standards for people with a disability.  We also need to ensure that the resources are in place to allow implementation of the recommendations in this motion.  It is no good changing policy without the resources to back it up.  We have ample evidence that the number of people in emergency accommodation in the State is increasing.  What percentage of those people are living with a disability?  It should never be an emergency situation in the first place and it is not fair that because of bad planning, mismanagement and a basic lack of sustained investment, resources are swallowed up on meeting emergency demand.<\/p><p>In my county, Waterford, there is a very long waiting list for accommodation suitable for people with a disability.  I know that because I am on the waiting list.  My daughter, who is 25, was born with physical and intellectual disability.  We have been on the list for more than five years.  My daughter's housing need will differ now from her housing need when she is 35 and, hopefully, 75.  I know also that, like many of her age, she wants to live with her peers.  At 35 she may well have a partner.  At 75 she will have other needs.  Fundamentally, as a mother, I want to be able to give her the ability to have a home environment that underpins her independence as much as possible and for as long as possible.  For her, housing should evolve with a person's life cycle, which I am sure is also true for every other person in her situation.  That must be incorporated into our approach to delivering housing.  This life-cycle principle, which I hope will be applied to my daughter, should be applied to the way we plan for and build our communities, because when we talk of building houses we are really talking about building communities and houses that are fit for purpose and help to promote well-being.  We need an integrated, inclusive and sustainable approach to building houses for those less fortunate than the Minister and I - namely, those people with disabilities.  I have full confidence in the Minister's ability to get that going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#OO00200","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I commend both Senator Dolan and Senator O'Sullivan for proposing and seconding the motion.  It is very relevant in the context of the wider housing debate, which as we all know is one of the biggest challenges facing the country.  As a former local authority member for eight years and chairperson of a housing strategic policy committee within a local authority, I have had experience at the coalface where people with disabilities were presenting for housing.  In some cases the local authority was able to respond but, unfortunately, in others, as outlined by the Senators, for one reason or another the local authorities, whether it was down to resources or the building stock available, were not capable of responding in an appropriate fashion to meet the needs of the disabled persons involved.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that this issue is being put at the top of the agenda by way of this motion.  Senator Dolan has long been an advocate for the disability sector, and he will continue that advocacy in the Chamber.  I congratulate him on that and offer him my support, in whatever way I can, in terms of progressing the interests of the disabled, especially on this topic of housing.<\/p> <p>The housing need across the country is one of the biggest challenges facing the Minister and society.  I do not with to go over old ground, but we have experienced a collapse in the housing market.  We have what one would call a dysfunctional property market.  Local authorities were denuded of resources for one reason or another.  I am not pointing a finger, but it is a fact that they were unable to build houses or adapt houses to the extent they would have wished in recent years.  The challenge now is to rebuild that capacity within local authorities, and within the approved housing bodies sector as well, which I believe is a critical component in meeting the existing needs.  I also want to see the private sector return to some level of sustainability.<\/p> <p>When we debate housing for the disabled, we should acknowledge that some progress has been made.  Improvements can always be achieved but the Part M regulations are a requirement for the building of all new properties.  There are regulations governing rental properties also, in that they must be up to a standard that is appropriate for the accommodation of those who are disabled.  That should be acknowledged, and it is welcome that any new housing stock, as we undertake new housing programmes in both the private and the public sector, must meet the Part M building regulations.<\/p> <p>Part V developments were mentioned also.  We are speaking to the Minister directly, and he is the policy maker who makes provision within the Estimates for housing allocations, but, ultimately, it is the local authority that is responsible for housing assessments in terms of eligibility and also for housing allocations.  There is a huge responsibility for local authorities.<\/p> <p>With regard to the strategic policy committees that I mentioned, there is a responsibility for councillors to make adequate provision to meet the demand in their respective local authority areas.  I refer specifically to the housing adaptation grants that are available, both private and public, to accommodate disabled persons.  If we take it on a comparative basis across the country, some local authorities perform extremely well in drawing down funds from central Government and the Minister's Department, but it has to be said that others are deplorable.  I am not pointing the finger at local authorities.  I had experience, when I was a Minister of State at the Department responsible for housing, of Deputies and Senators from all parties wanting to know why their allocations for housing adaptation grants were not as high in the current year as in other years.  The reason is that the local authorities have not been as active in providing 20% of the funding so that they can draw down the other 80% of funding from central Government.<\/p> <p>There is work to be done at local authority level to ensure that the strategic policy committees approach this topic in the same positive fashion as the Senators have proposed, but there is also an onus on us, centrally and at national level, to ensure that we provide adequate resources for people with disabilities.  We do have a housing crisis and people are living in unsatisfactory circumstances, but all of us would agree that those with disabilities should be prioritised.  It is not for the Minister to do that; it is for the local authority, which is the statutory housing body responsible for housing people.  The approved housing bodies also have access to grant assistance to provide funding for those with disabilities.  I am sure the Minister will outline that through the social housing strategy.  I know he is working on a new action plan for housing, which we all look forward to hearing about, and I expect to hear provision within that action plan for housing to address some of the concerns the Senators raised.  I expect also that mobility grants, housing adaptation grants and other resources that are required to meet the need of the disabled people who badly need them will be provided for in the housing action plan.<\/p> <p>I mentioned the role of the local authorities.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the cross-cutting that is required in other Departments.  I include the Health Service Executive in that, which also has a role in terms of providing capital funds targeted at the acquisition and refurbishment of properties to accommodate disabled individuals who are transitioning from priority institutions.  Between the HSE and the Department of housing and local government, for which the Minister is now responsible, there are opportunities to enhance resources to help those who are disabled.<\/p> <p>I am conscious of some anomalies in the system that might arise from time to time.  An approved housing body may apply to the Department for capital assistance funding but it falls between two stools because of the HSE funding or the designated status of the centre.  That is an issue that the Minister and his officials should examine to ameliorate that anomaly byf creating greater flexibility to ensure that where people or approved housing bodies apply for funding, they qualify for the assistance available to disabled persons or people incapacitated in the same way that local authorities or others would qualify for the capital acquisition schemes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is the main bulk of funding which is available to local authorities and approved housing bodies and just because a designation or status applies to a person, he or she should not be excluded from that particular category.  I acknowledge that some work will need to be done by the HSE and ourselves in that regard.  There are enough mechanisms - for example, the existing national housing strategy and national implementation framework - in place to allow for flexibilities to develop.<\/p><p>I have noticed another anomaly, especially in the south east, in respect of housing institutions for the elderly.  They are registered as approved housing bodies but are regulated as nursing homes.  They are not nursing homes but they are subject to regulations issued by HIQA, etc.  The older people for whom these organisations cater live independently in sheltered accommodation, although with some support .  Individuals who are housed in this way are being taken off the housing list in the relevant local authority areas and this means that local authorities or approved housing bodies will not have to provide funding for them.  Unfortunately, because of their status, they are falling between two stools.  If some of these institutions come under pressure due to HIQA rules or if they cannot secure investment in the form of various Government grants, they will close and we will lose these further supports for older people and those who are disabled.<\/p><p>I welcome the motion and the opportunity for all Senators to contribute to the debate on it.  This is also an opportunity for the Minister and his officials to review the current supports and to enhance them, if possible, in future Estimates and the forthcoming action plan for housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#PP00200","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support this motion.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities are given equal opportunities and access to essential services.  Some 13% of the population is classified as having a disability.  I hope the new national disability inclusion strategy, which is due to be in place by the end of 2016, will reflect this.  I think this is crucial.  I also welcome the recent establishment of the housing and disability steering groups within our local authorities.  I had some queries about these but I believe they have just been set up.  I always felt the disability sector had not been addressed enough but at least the steering groups have now been set up.  I know the Minister will address the issue.<\/p> <p>In 2011 the HSE published Time to Move on from Congregated Settings.  A congregated setting is a residential facility with ten or more people, for residential support into mainstream community.  This is a crucial issue because on the agenda today is Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which states Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement\".  This is crucial.  People who have disabilities are very vulnerable in society.  I always believe that they are forgotten.  I was a member of my local authority for 19 years and, in my experience, the only scheme of funding for people with disabilities was the capital assistance scheme, CAS.  This is for people with disabilities, older people and the homeless.  If the local authority in Carlow was to apply to the Department for housing for ten people with disabilities, the local authority may only get funding for three.  There is always a backlog for people with disabilities.  This needs to be addressed.  There should be separate capital funding for people with disabilities.  I firmly believe the Minister needs to address this issue in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>There are two grants available for people who have disabilities.   There is the mobility aids grant which is the local authority grant.  However, that grant only goes up to &euro;6,000 which means that only small works can be carried out, such as installing handrails or replacing a bath with a shower.  There is also the housing adaptation grant for people with disabilities which is up to &euro;30,000.  However, that grant is means tested and where one has a family with disabilities, or one or two children with disabilities, that family has to come up with more of the funding themselves.  I ask the Minister to look at the matter of housing adaptation for people with disabilities and examine the position with regard to mobility aids.<\/p> <p>It is important that, as the economy recovers, people with disabilities are not left behind.  Disability inclusion must be a central tenet of the Government's agenda and access to services and resources must be directed, in the first instance, to those most in need and especially to the people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>When I was a councillor - this has also proven to be the case since I came to the Seanad - I felt that the lack of information was the biggest issue relating to disability.  I have always been of the view that people with disabilities are forgotten.  Perhaps the Minister, when he is putting the new programme in place, could ensure that people with disabilities know their entitlements.  This matter needs to be addressed in a serious fashion.  I hope the Minister might be able to provide some information on the new action plan.  As he is aware, we are dealing with an emergency.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis, there is homelessness and children are living in bed and breakfast accommodation.  People are trying to get organised to get the children back to school and they are cutting back on food because they cannot afford the costs involved.  Will the Minister return to the House urgently with the new housing action plan, particularly as these issues need to be addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#QQ00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I thank Senators Dolan, Grace O'Sullivan, Black, Higgins, Kelleher and Ruane for using Private Members' time to table this very important issue.<\/p> <p>I am a former director of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and I spent many years on its board.  I remain pretty much involved in the whole disability sector.  We had a catch phrase in Cork for the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.  I am sure the Minister would be very familiar with the organisation, particularly as he comes from that neck of the woods.  The catch phrase in question was a simple slogan which tried to encapsulate the core message of our ethos and work.  It was about providing independent mobility with dignity.  It reminded me, when I reflected on that, what this debate is all about.  This is about people's rights, which are enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  They have special rights.  It is about choice, dignity and people being allowed to play a meaningful and independent role where possible within their communities and where they decide.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the work Senator Coffey, as a former Minister of State in the Department, did in this area.  In fairness, he did a great deal of work on it.  In a previous contribution, the Senator spoke about local authorities.  I have been a member of the local authority for many years.  I accept that local authorities have failed in this regard but what have successive Ministers done?  The debate cannot be divorced from the position regarding D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and local councils.  These councils are made up of members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and all parties and none.  I know what has happened.  In some cases, there is no joined-up thinking between the strategic policy committees on planning and on housing and nor is there any commitment or drive.<\/p> <p>I do not need to tell the Minister about the lack of enthusiasm on the part of some local authorities to delivering housing.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council - my local authority - has 6,500 people on it housing waiting list.  Many excuses are offered and we are informed that loads of people are looking into the problem.   Loads of councillors from all groups and none bring proposals and chief executives, who are usually empowered by legislation and by the political process, inform them that it is a matter of resources.  I am fed up of this excuse about resources.  I am also fed up with politicians saying it is the establishment, the county management or the chief executives.  We have got to pull it all back.  I would nearly say that we need a major housing body for the four Dublin councils.<\/p> <p>The local authorities are not delivering on housing and that is the reality.  The Minister knows his sums and is preparing a major report on housing.  I have spoken to a number of county managers and chief executives and they were interested to hear what the Minister is going to come up with.  However, let us acknowledge that local authorities have not delivered.  One could also say that the elected members of local authorities have not pushed the matter.  I have been at strategic policy committees that have a quorum and ten minutes later the attendees have emptied out of the room.  These are the facts and I do not wish to keep going on about them.  The key message is that I hope, in the context of the Minister's report, we set quotas for the delivery of houses for people with disabilities.  We also need to provide resources or tell the local authorities to provide the resources.  It is great that the legislation is in place because local authorities were taking money in lieu of Part V for years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#QQ00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Not any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#QQ00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>That has changed.

He is a very capable Minister and it is more than likely that he has already dealt with the issue.

I know him of old from his role in the disability area.  It is something in which I have a particular interest and on which we can all agree.<\/p> <p>There are a number of aspects to the issue.  I can only speak from my first-hand experiences in Limerick, where the main service providers in residential settings include the Daughters of Charity at St. Vincent's Hospital in Lisnagry, Bawnmore, and St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville.  There are also service providers such as Enable Ireland.  They do fantastic work.<\/p> <p>A number of points have been made.  I refer to congregated settings.  It is a positive measure to have people with disabilities living in their communities.  It is very natural, but their housing requires a bit more work than normal housing and resources have to be provided.  When Senator Coffey was Minister of State and had responsibility for housing, he provided funding for the Cappamore voluntary housing association to build up to 12 units to accommodate people with disabilities.  That was very progressive and positive, and provided housing in a rural village setting.  I commend and thank him on behalf of the people of Cappamore, who were delighted with the positive measure.  <\/p> <p>From my reading around the issue, I have been struck by the reporting by local authorities of the number of units provided for people with disabilities on an annual basis.  I was struck by the fact that public funds are being used, yet there does not appear to be any reporting structure outside that of local authority members.  That has to be changed.  I assumed that a reporting structure was in place, but I found there was not.  The action plan for housing should contain an automatic requirement for such a reporting structure.  If we had that information, we would be able to compare local authorities.  Some local authorities are doing fantastic work, but perhaps others are not doing as well.  We have to benchmark the provision of services if public funds are involved.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to unspent Part V funding.  A large chunk of that should probably go towards disability funding, which encompasses a broad spectrum.  I know of elderly parents looking after their severely disabled son who attends one of the main service providers in the Limerick city.  He lives with them on a daily basis.  The parents are now in their 70s.  Luckily, someone in the mid-western HSE region is involved in the case and is seeking long-term accommodation for the family.  <\/p> <p>One of the greatest worries for the parents of children with disabilities is what will happen when they die.  It is one of the imponderables, as Senator Dolan knows.  We have never found a satisfactory mechanism to deal with this issue.  Service providers such as St. Joseph's, Bawnmore and the Daughters of Charity in Lisnagry provide residential facilities.  It is an issue we need to address.  It is not an easy issue to deal with because properties suitable for those with disabilities need to be found.  Invariably, that involves bungalow settings, living on the ground floor of a building or the adaptation of housing.<\/p> <p>It is extremely important that we find ways for people to live their local areas.  In cases where a son or daughter is living with his or her parents, we have to find a mechanism whereby he or she can live in a unit nearby.  The human dimension of the issues that people with disabilities face is extremely important.<\/p> <p>I wholeheartedly support the motion.  It is opportune that the Minister is introducing the action plan for housing.  These matters can be integrated.  The positive aspects are the funding of &euro;10 million provided under the CAS system for Cappamore voluntary community housing by the former Minister of State, Senator Coffey.  The move away from congregated settings is very important, as is the &euro;20 million provided to adapt buildings.  The disabled person's grant is good, but it is limited.  Councillors, Deputies and Senators have sought such grants for constituents over many years.  We have to bring the issue of disability to the mainstream.  We are getting to that point.  We have to ensure that people can live in their communities and that houses are adapted.<\/p> <p>I welcome the establishment by the Minister of specific groups with the local authorities, but while all the dots are in local authorities, they need to be joined up in terms of benchmarking.  Serious levels of public funding are involved.  When a report is produced it should be sent to local authority members, as is their entitlement, as well as to the Department and the Minister.  That would create a certain cohesion in funding.  We are dealing with human lives.  Part V funding should be integrated as part of the annual reporting mechanism.  The action plan for housing will be published on Tuesday of next week, I understand.  I welcome that and have no doubt that a section of it will deal with housing for those with disabilities.  I would like to see specific funding provided and for the area of disabilities to become part of the mainstream and the normal provision of social housing.  On occasion, people living in villages or rural or urban settings have been moved from their home environment to units that might be ideal in terms of physical structure but do not meet their emotional and human needs, which is extremely important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#RR00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

Previously, we in Sinn F&eacute;in have supported such moves but we would also like to seek assurances that full integration takes place as well.  Therefore, I welcome the measures in the motion that call for the disability-proofing of the social housing 2020 strategy.  I especially welcome the provision for a percentage of Part V housing to be set aside for those with disabilities.  I concur with Senator Boyhan on the comments he has made about the funding.  Full clarity as to where the Part V funding is, where it has been and how much of it there is would certainly be very welcome.  Perhaps the Minister could return to the House or circulate those figures when they are made available to him.<br\/><br\/>Under Fianna F&aacute;il and under the Fine Gael coalition from 2010 to 2014, the housing adaptation grant was cut by a staggering 56%.  This cut has had a detrimental effect on the amount of units available that are suitably adapted.  It also meant that many people with disabilities who wished to remain at home were forced to live in accommodation that was wholly unsuitable.  I visited a man in my own home area recently.  He is in a wheelchair and has lost a leg.  He has no social housing that is adapted and available to him.  He is renting a chalet from a local person.  When I went in to see his situation, it was absolutely unbelievable.  He is in a wheelchair and the corridor that he has to traverse every day and night is literally just wide enough to get in and out of with the wheelchair.  All the shelves, cupboards, etc., are too high.  He is in a really difficult situation and is at his wit's end.  He was getting very depressed because of the whole situation and the fact that he has been on the housing list for quite a number of years and is getting nowhere with the local authority.  This is very much a personal issue for so many people and that is only one example.<br\/><br\/>This is part of the hidden side of the cuts that many previous Governments were blind to or did not want to know about.  These people are languishing on the list.  Everybody on the housing list is certainly unhappy that they are so long on it, but people with a disability are being given and added burden to carry.  The housing adaptation grant for people with disabilities should be made available to tenants of local authorities and should be paid to voluntary housing agencies and indeed private landlords to encourage people to make the necessary adaptions to the housing stock, such as the ones that I have outlined.<br\/><br\/>There was a recent report in <i>The Connacht Tribune<\/i>about residents of council houses in Galway having to wait up to 18 months for vital extensions, only to be turned down.  According to the report, the council did not carry out a single extension last year.  It is disgraceful to make people wait that long even just to find out what is going to happen to what are already unsuitable units.  It is also short-sighted as the population with disabilities and those over 65 is increasing rapidly.  There are sensible provisions in the motion that take account of the existing housing crisis.  If there are to be any major moves towards significant new house builds, these plans must contain provisions for those with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an ngr&uacute;pa um rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht shibhialta as an r&uacute;n seo a chur le ch&eacute;ile agus t&aacute;im ag s&uacute;il go mbeimid in ann oibri&uacute; le ch&eacute;ile ar na gn&oacute;tha&iacute; seo san am at&aacute; le teacht.  I welcome that the Minister is coming forward with his own plan next week.  I know that the committee on housing and homelessness, which my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Broin was a member of, worked very hard on many of the recommendations that it has made on the whole area.  I appreciate that the Minister recognises that there is an absolute emergency at this stage in the housing sector.  We certainly do not want people with disabilities to be the poor relations again on the issue of housing.  They need to be central to all of the policy.  All of the policy that is coming forward should be disability-proofed.

I commend Senator Dolan and the group for bringing forward this Private Members' motion.  I welcome the Minister's intention to proceed with the implementation of A Vision for Change and, in particular, the report of the working group on congregated settings, which was a far-reaching indictment of the residential care settings for people with intellectual disabilities.  We have had to wait nine years for the implementation of A Vision for Change and five years for any progress on the report on congregated settings.  In the meantime, last year we saw a \"Prime Time\" investigation into &Aacute;ras Attracta, which uncovered the appalling service many people with intellectual disabilities continue to receive at the hands of the State.  I am now ashamed to say that in 2016, when almost all of the large residential centres in the United Kingdom have closed, nearly 50% of Irish citizens who receive residential services still live in outdated institutional settings.  In many cases, the lives these people lead are more impoverished than those who receive no services at all.  This is the real housing crisis for people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p> <p>For any building to become a home, it must be imbued with a range of meanings, feelings and experiences by its occupants.  A home is not merely a shelter.  A real home has a hearth; a sense of warmth and comfort.  A real home has heart; it is a place of emotional warmth and connection.  A home is a place of privacy, where the occupant can control who can come in and who cannot.  A real home has a sense of identity.  It has roots and it is where one belongs.  If we accept all of these as definitions of a home, then most people who live in a congregated setting are actually homeless.  They may have shelter, but without a hearth, heart, privacy or identity, a house is not a home.<\/p> <p>I implore the Minister.  People with intellectual disabilities do not need bricks and mortar.  They do not need politicians and planners to develop housing and then consign them beds.  This is putting the cart before the horse.  No one should be consigned to a house without first being allowed to articulate a vision for a better future.  In this way, housing, like all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities, must be an interdepartmental concern with the voice of people with disabilities at the centre.  Services for people with disabilities should not be service-centred, staff-centred or building-centred.  Disempowerment has been the history of people with disabilities.  Let it not be their future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#SS00200","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for tabling this motion which the Labour Party is obviously delighted to support.  It is a very interesting debate.  I am sure that the Minister will agree that the expertise in this Chamber is quite remarkable, from the campaigning sector to parents.  Senator O'Sullivan's contribution was quite impressive.  There are former local authority members and indeed a former Minister for housing in the Seanad as well.  It adds great weight to the debate.<\/p> <p>In general terms, I wish to say that, like all issues when dealing with people with disabilities, we unfortunately tend to compartmentalise the issues.  I know this from my experience as a Minister of State in the last Government when dealing with the employment issue.  The tendency was to view issues of people with disabilities as separate from the mainstream.  I believe that is a mistake.  Employment is important and housing is important, regardless of how crises come and go.  There is a tendency in Irish public policy to aim to sort out the mainstream crisis or emergency first and then to deal with these supposed issues, which are characterised as side-issues, but are really central to the entire debate.  It was a disappointment for me and to people in the sector when we saw that An Action Plan for Jobs did not include a more comprehensive set of proposals for every sector of society.<\/p> <p>As Senator McFadden quite rightly said, this comes down to issues of empowerment and identity.  What is more important to one's identity than the job one does or where one lives?  It is central to our aim of getting away from the charitable view of people with disabilities towards a more rights-focused and rights-centred approach to the entire area.  I know that the Minister is grappling with this issue as a new person in the job and that he intends to publish his action plan for housing next week.  Even at this late stage, I implore the Minister to insert into that action plan a section dedicated to housing for people with disabilities because we have had a litany of failures.<\/p> <p>This goes beyond governmental records going back over the years, which have been previously mentioned.  People have mentioned what local authorities have done and do not do.  I will give two points in terms of the local authorities' response.  Senator Boyhan mentioned local authority members.  I believe it is legitimate to say that it is not good enough for local authority members to complain about a lack of resources coming from central government when they are beating down the door in order to reduce the property tax in their own local area by 15%, which would be a perfectly adequate funding mechanism to supply housing for various different sectors of society that need it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Voting that down by 15% is their power, but they then complain about a lack of resources.  If we are going to be serious about the services we want our local councillors to supply in their local authority areas, they must take the responsibility seriously and deliver for those who need it most.<\/p><p>There must be understanding in the wider society about the necessity for housing, because when it comes to housing for people on the edges of society, which could include Traveller accommodation or people with addiction, mental health or disability issues, there will regularly be a reaction from residents' groups and communities.  I am quite sure everybody in this room involved with politics has been to meetings where statements are made that in the fullness of time might embarrass the speakers.  Everybody wants solutions to the homelessness crisis or for homelessness to be resolved but they do not want it done necessarily on their doorstep.  Everybody feels there should be appropriate accommodation for Travellers, but not near them, thank you very much.  Everybody feels we should have proper accommodation for people with disabilities or mental health challenges, but not near them.<\/p><p>After the election I attended a public meeting in my own constituency relating to a 68-unit development.  Some of the statements made in that room made me feel I was at a meeting somewhere in the Deep South, perhaps Alabama, in the 1950s, with pitchforks being wielded.  One woman stood up to say she had never been ashamed to live in the community where she resides until she sat in that room that night.  There were 250 people in a packed room because they were upset at the suggestion there would be 68 social housing units in their community.  We can compare that with the public outcry over homelessness and the housing crisis or the rhetoric coming from local authority members who vote to reduce the local property tax by 15%.  There is a collective responsibility across all sectors, including politics and those with responsible leadership positions in their own communities, to be part of the solution.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister every success.  None of us in the Chamber, and certainly no one in my party, intends in any way to be obstructionist or score political points on an issue such as this.  There are practical solutions to be found.  Issues relating to the elderly have been suggested.  I met a group recently talking about dead space in areas where senior citizens reside more densely, as there may be cases in which one person resides in a four-bedroom house.  We discussed how the local authority could renovate a portion of such houses to facilitate rental income for the person, who could use it to adapt another part of the house, thus allowing the dead space, through a funding mechanism, to refurbish the other space.  This would allow us to move away from the idea that a single person in later years in a four-bedroom house must find a smaller unit.  People have neighbours and contacts and may not want to move.  There are innovative ways of different groups coming together to try to find solutions to the problems we face.<\/p><p>The expertise in this room is quite remarkable.  Many motions coming before this and the other House are sometimes provocative for the sake of it, but this is a comprehensive, well thought out and detailed motion that will benefit the Minister.  The message must go out to local authorities to do the job they have to do, but also that local authority members must take responsibility for the budgets they pass seriously.  There is a societal responsibility to take on the issue.  The essential point is not to make the mistake of divorcing the issue of employment for people with disabilities from the central Action Plan for Jobs employment strategy.  If a housing strategy emerges next Tuesday, it should not divorce housing need for people with disabilities from the central document.  I know the document is being made in the middle of an emergency and I understand that on Tuesday people will be lining up to take potshots at it and criticise it even before it is published.  None the less, even at this late stage and with the guts of a week to go, if it has not been done, perhaps the strategy could contain many, if not all, of the suggestions in this motion.  I have no knowledge of whether they are in the document.  I wish the Minister every success, and the Labour Party is here to assist in tackling the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#SS00300","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on his new post.  I will keep this quite simple.  I have known Senator Dolan and all the great work he has done for people with disabilities over the years.  I often hear people in my locality speaking fondly about Senator Dolan and the work he has done.  I am certainly delighted to support his motion today.<\/p> <p>People with disabilities should be prioritised in any housing policy.  Council strategic policy committees, SPCs, have a responsibility to shoulder and a weight that must be carried in this regard.  They should really try harder to facilitate people with disabilities, as there is no doubt they should be a priority.  There have been upgrades and changes to planning regulations over the years and there has been an associated cost in bringing housing on-stream.  The changes required for people with disabilities relate to door widths, room sizes, levels of lights and so on.  There have been major steps forward but it has brought an associated cost.<\/p> <p>There was a proposal from the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers relating to VAT and housing.  It could provide a small step forward.  If a builder or developer spoke with a council about a project and the Department indicated that housing for people with disabilities would be VAT-free, it could provide a major step forward.  There might be a chance for the Department to trial it on a small scale.  We did calculations and at the time it was indicated that there would be savings of approximately 19%.  I know 13.5% is the broader rate for a builder, but there is a cost for goods and levies, which might be excluded by the council.  The saving could be 18% to 20%.  This would be a good place to start, as it is practical.  Perhaps we are close to covering the cost of building in Dublin but we are not at that point yet in most counties, so nobody is looking at these projects.  There are many people sitting on sites.  If these people could speak with council representatives and build for 18% or 20% less, it would make the project more attractive.  If there are 50 people with disabilities that need housing urgently, this approach could certainly tackle such a problem.  It could be a massive step forward and it would be cost-neutral.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister is very resourceful and has done much work.  He has taken submissions from several bodies.

As somebody who was a member of a local authority and who has been involved in a number of disability-related issues over the past two to three years, I have found the process of seeking assistance for adaptation work in local authority houses extremely frustrating, as have many families dealing with local authorities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was forced to take two particular cases to the Ombudsman to assist families in getting work done.  One family received a letter from the local authority in July 2008 confirming that they were on the list for adaptation work.  They had a child with severe intellectual and physical disabilities.  They had the full support of the public health nurse and an organisation assisting them with the care of their child.  I came across them six years after they were told they were on the list for adaptation work, but no such work had been done.  I corresponded with a local authority for eight months, but still nothing was done.  As a result, it ended up going to the Ombudsman before any work was undertaken.<\/p><p>I am glad to report that the necessary was done in the house to make it that much easier for the family to look after that child.  It was outrageous, however, that it took a total of seven and a half years from the initial application to the completion of the work, despite the family having full support.  There was clear evidence that what this family was doing was way beyond the call of duty.  If their child was in State care, it would cost about &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 per week to provide the level of care that the parents were providing.  Despite that, they had to fight for seven and a half years before the necessary work was completed.<\/p><p>There is supposed to be an access officer in each local authority, but local authorities around the country have totally different definitions as to what is an access officer's role.  My understanding from the legislation is that the access officer not only examines access to public buildings for people with disabilities, but also access to all local authority services.  For example, I questioned a number of different local authorities and one of them said the access officer had been involved in two projects for the entire 12 months, costing a total of &euro;4,000.  I am not saying that the access officer was not doing other work, but that was their sole contribution to access for people with disabilities in that 12-month period.  <\/p><p>I contacted the Disability Authority concerning the role of access officers.  We passed legislation on this, but what is their role?  In particular, it applies to ensuring that there is someone within a local authority to help people with disabilities and to fight their corner.  The Minister's Department should now examine the legislation to ascertain whether it is adequate in clearly defining the access officer's role.  It should be clearly stated that someone in a local authority is prepared to put forward the best possible case for people with disabilities.  We urgently need to do this.  <\/p><p>In recent years, we have made a lot of progress but there are still many areas that we tend to park and say they are something we will get around to doing.  We have a great opportunity to act now that better funding is being provided to local authorities.  It is also about co-ordination nationally and locally to ensure that local authorities which do not follow through on this role are brought to heel.  <\/p><p>In dealing with adaptation grants, I found that some local authorities had done their plan of action as far back as November or December of the previous year regarding what work they needed to do on houses.  Other authorities, however, waited until the Department said that money would be available for such work and sought submissions.  Those submissions took a further three or four months to arrive in the Department.  We need to clearly set out for local authorities what funding will be made available for adaptation work over the next three to four years so that long-term planning can ensue. <\/p><p>Some local authorities may say they cannot undertake adaptation work because they do not know how much funding is available.  Other authorities say that while they receive funding for adaptation work in June or July, they are unable to use it by the end of December and therefore must refund the money to the Department.  We should ensure that local authorities have no excuse for refunding money.<\/p><p>Senators have made good contributions to this debate covering various areas.  The point was made concerning Part V, that money which is supposed to be used for infrastructural work is not left there for a further three to four years when it could be used urgently for local authority houses. <\/p><p>A Senator mentioned four-bedroom houses which have a single occupant who may wish to downsize.  I came across this matter as recently as last weekend while doing clinics.  They may be waiting to downsize on a housing list for five or six years, but the local authority is not responding.  Such a person may be quite prepared to take a two-bedroom or smaller house, thus freeing up a four-bedroom house.  I have met a number of people in my own local authority area who are in that position.  Local authorities have the requisite powers but appear slow to react, even though it would mean making a three or four-bedroom house immediately available for a family.  However, I know that this is slightly moving away from the point of this debate.<\/p><p>I welcome the debate and feel it is important for us to identify the areas where work is not being done.  We must ensure that available funding is used in a timely manner so that necessary works can be carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#TT00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Senator John Dolan and Senator Grace O'Sullivan for bringing this important motion before the House.  I congratulate the Minister on his current portfolio which he has taken on with great enthusiasm.  I sincerely hope that people's expectations will not be overly complicated.  I believe the Minister will do everything he can to deal with the housing crisis, but he is not God and can only do so much.  I hope we will understand that, as he delivers his programme.<\/p> <p>In his presentation, Senator Dolan mentioned the line, \"Get on with your life\".  It is on that basis that I want to speak, not about disability but about ability.  I am personally aware of two young men, both of whom are profoundly disabled, married and living within the city centre area.  Both of them are paying massive rents.  They live in a constant state of fear of homelessness because they are about at the limit of what they can afford in rent.  They will never be able to save for a deposit on a house; it is just not possible in their current environment.  Moreover, if they seek to buy a house or an apartment it cannot be in the suburbs.  It must be in the city centre because they work there and for that they will pay a premium.  More importantly, if they ever find the money to purchase a city centre apartment, it will have to be completely renovated.<\/p> <p>One of these individuals loves to cook and is a fantastic chef, but everything must be at ground level because this man has no legs.  One can imagine, therefore, that if he goes into a modern apartment block, it is totally useless to him.  I have discussed with both of these people the notion that they might put themselves on the housing list and they said: \"Why?  We have good jobs.  We are able to pay the rent.  We don't need to look to the State to provide accommodation for us.\"  What they do need, however, is support.  The Minister and I discussed this matter during talks on the programme for Government, that we would have some recognition of rent paid in lieu of deposit requirements when it comes to purchasing property.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

They are middle of the road employees who will never be able to save money.<\/p><p>The proposal put forward by my colleague regarding the reduction in VAT may greatly assist them in purchasing a house.  I do not wish to throw another spanner in the works for the Minister because he has enough on his plate but we have to find some way of supporting people such as these who are living independently.  All they ask is that they be allowed to live somewhere central enough to allow them to work.  A battery-operated wheelchair will only go so far before it needs to be recharged.  In all cases, they need two wheelchairs - a push wheelchair and a battery-operated wheelchair - depending on what they are doing or where they are going at any given time.  Both of the people to whom I refer go on holidays abroad and they are entitled to their holiday like anybody else.  However, we have to find a way of enabling them to have the same opportunity to build a home as the Minister or myself who are able bodied.<\/p><p>The first time I met one of these individuals, he was coming towards me and I thought, \"Oh my God, what I am going to say?\", because he was not what I expected.  Ten minutes after I met him, I had forgotten he was in a wheelchair.  Anybody who has ever met this guy has had the same experience.  When the Minister brings his plan forward, I ask him to think about the VAT option, and to examine a way to instruct builders to provide one apartment in every 60 they build, for example, to meet the needs of a specific set of people with disabilities.  If that could be done, it would make the lives of these people much better.  Something will have to be done about the way the banks require deposits before they will lend money to young people with disabilities and I acknowledge that does not come under the Minister's remit.  This issue affects all young people but these people have a specific need.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.<\/p><p>I wish him well with his portfolio.

There is clearly a great deal of knowledge in this room about this issue.  I thank Senators Dolan and O'Sullivan.  I know Senator Kelleher quite well and given her experience with the various organisations she has worked for, it is a good example of the Seanad adding value to a debate around a sector that needs a comprehensive policy response.  Having former Ministers for housing in the House also significantly helps as well.<\/p> <p>We have a housing strategy, which will be launched next Tuesday afternoon, I hope, as long I get it approved by Government on Tuesday.  It will not perform miracles or deal comprehensively with everything but it will be a good start as a response to a series of pressures linked to housing and shortage of supply, as well as a response to the systems that are not delivering at a pace that they need to deliver at, whether that is housing for people with disabilities or the myriad other groups to which the State needs to respond at a faster pace than it has been able to do to date.  Obviously, resource issues need to be resolved and finalised before that strategy can be launched.  I hope we will have an opportunity to take statements in the House next week after the launch.  I would like to come in and talk through some of the sectors and get some feedback.  I will be the first to say that strategy is not the finished article and we will add to it as needed.  This will be a moving strategy for the lifetime of the Government, however long it lasts.  We will add and subtract, amend and change, and improve as we go along when people make suggestions.  There has been a good deal of stakeholder consultation, including with some in the disability sector, and I will try to take on board as much as I can.  I will be happy to come to the House next week to debate this strategy if the schedule permits in order that Members can see the detail, comment and add to it.<\/p> <p>Addressing the needs of people with disabilities is well established in housing policy.  The publication of the national housing strategy for people with disabilities and related implementation framework in 2011 and 2012 was a significant step in the right direction.  These documents have guided policy considerations and delivery of housing for people with disabilities since then.  The commitment in the programme for partnership Government \"to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are incorporated into all future housing policies\" reflects the priority the Government attaches to this issue.  We will consolidate and build on the significant work to date and ensure that momentum is enhanced and sustained into the future, and that commitment will be further reinforced in the action plan I am launching next week.<\/p> <p>The national housing strategy for people with a disabilities was a turning point in how the housing needs of people with disabilities would be addressed.  The strategy and implementation framework, which were published jointly by my Department and the Department of Health, were developed as part of a coherent and integrated framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities.  The strategy sets out the broad framework aimed at promoting and mainstreaming equality of access for people with a disability to the full range of housing options available suited to individual and household need, and to support them to live independently in their own homes.<\/p> <p>The strategy&rsquo;s approach is twofold.  It supports people with disabilities who live in the community and who may require more specific supports to enable them to remain in their own homes or move to more suitable accommodation as their needs change.  Second, it gives effect to the housing provisions outlined in the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change, and the report of the working group on congregated settings, to which a number of Members referred.  Both policies provide for the transitioning of people with disabilities from institutional care to more appropriate community-based living arrangements.  It would be no harm to benchmark how we are doing versus other European countries in this regard, as suggested by a number of Senators, in addressing some of the challenges we are facing.  Senator McFadden, in particular, made a strong contribution on this issue.<\/p> <p>Implementation of identified actions in the strategy is being driven primarily by the Housing Agency by means of a dedicated subgroup, which comprises representatives from my Department, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability representative organisations.  Since it was established in 2012, the subgroup has overseen and progressed a range of priority actions, including: the development of national guidelines for the assessment and allocation process for housing provision for people with disabilities; the establishment of housing and disability steering groups within local authorities, which were welcomed earlier; and the preparation of draft strategic plans for local areas to help identify and address the housing needs of people with a disability over the next five years.<\/p> <p>The local plans are currently being collated by the Housing Agency into a draft national strategic plan and will be submitted to my Department shortly.  Progress in implementing the strategy is being overseen by an implementation monitoring group, which is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Housing Agency, the National Disability Authority, the Irish Council for Social Housing, the County and City Management Association and disability representative organisations.  We have a strategy, a plan to make it work and we have an implementation monitoring group to make sure it happens.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The implementation of the strategy is an excellent example of the collaborative working arrangements between my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and relevant stakeholders in recent years.  Key to this approach is the inclusion and contribution of representatives from the disability sector and others, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everybody involved.  This partnership approach, involving cross-departmental and inter-agency co-operation, recognises that the provision of suitable housing is only one element of supporting people with disabilities in living fully inclusive lives.<br\/><br\/>The programme for Government commits to the preparation and publication of an action plan for housing within the Government's first 100 days.  The action plan is being drafted and is nearing finalisation with input from a number of key Departments.  It will also draw on the work of the special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness and its recommendations.  The action plan will be delivery-focused and will build on the considerable work already carried out or under way.  It will include actions to boost supply of all types of housing in the immediate, medium and longer term.  The plan will have a particular focus on those having most difficulty in accessing the housing and rental market at the moment, and will include the needs of specific groups, such as people with disabilities.  In this regard, the action plan will affirm and underpin support for the continuation of the national housing strategy for people with disabilities beyond 2016.<br\/><br\/>My Department, through the capital assistance scheme, CAS, provides important funding to approved housing bodies to provide funding for priority groups, including people with a disability.  In July 2015, under the CAS, funding totalling &euro;151 million was allocated to deliver 1,057 new accommodation units through construction and acquisition.  The former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey, was very involved in that.  This investment shows a strong commitment to meeting special housing needs for those who may require particular supports, including people with disabilities.  It is my intention to continue to provide funding for an ambitious construction and acquisitions programme under the capital assistance scheme into the future.<br\/><br\/>Implementation of the HSE congregated settings report is supported by my Department, which is represented on the HSE-led working group.  In order to accelerate progress in transitioning individuals from congregated settings, my Department is providing ring-fenced funding of &euro;10 million in 2016 under the capital assistance scheme.  This is specifically for the provision of housing for people with disabilities who are moving out of congregated settings into community-based living arrangements.  Separate to this, CAS funding is also available to provide housing for people with disabilities in the community more generally.  The capital assistance scheme draws on the knowledge and capacity of the approved housing body sector to provide high-quality housing suitable for people with a disability, and it will continue to be well funded, as part of the Government's new action plan for housing, to deliver for those who need social housing provision.<br\/><br\/>My Department also provides funding to local authorities under the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability in relation to private homes and, separately, funds adaptations and extensions to social housing stock to meet the needs of tenants with a disability.  I take on board what people have said in respect of those two schemes.  Total funding under the adaptation grants scheme has been increased in 2016 by 10% to an overall funding availability of more than &euro;56 million.  Some 7,600 households benefited under this scheme in 2015 and, with the additional funding provided, it is expected that this will increase to about 8,000 homes in 2016.  I am conscious of the significant social benefit accruing from this scheme in terms of facilitating continued independent living by people with a disability in their own homes; therefore, in line with the programme for Government, I will give further consideration to increasing this funding in the coming years.  I also understand how important it is that grant schemes such as these can be readily accessed by those who need them.  My Department will continue to work with local authorities to review the delivery of the schemes and streamline the application processes.<br\/><br\/>I am satisfied that the current regulatory framework for the assessment and allocation of households in need of social housing support, coupled with the guidance issued, provides what is necessary to ensure that the particular needs of households who have someone with a disability are effectively assessed and prioritised quickly and appropriately.  The allocation of social housing support to all qualified households is a matter for individual housing authorities in accordance with their allocation schemes.  A housing authority may prioritise certain classes of household for allocation on the basis of severity of need as they see fit, and households who have a person with a disability may be given a priority ranking.<br\/><br\/>The results of the 2016 summary of social housing assessments will, when available later this year, provide updated data for the number of people on housing waiting lists, including current information on the level of households with disabilities in need of social housing support.  I take it from the motion tabled that the number is still significant, somewhere between 3,500 and 4,000.<br\/><br\/>In preparing its housing strategy under the Planning and Development Act 2000, each planning authority must have regard to the most recent summary of social housing assessments and also the need to ensure that a mixture of house types and sizes is developed to reasonably match the requirements of different categories of household.  This includes the special requirements of elderly persons and persons with disabilities.  They must also have regard to relevant policies or objectives of the Government, including the national housing strategy for people with disabilities.  It is a matter, therefore, for a planning authority, in making a Part V agreement, to ensure that the units provided in any given development will satisfy its housing need.  A decision on whether a certain percentage of Part V units should be reserved for people with disabilities is a matter for each individual local authority in accordance with its own housing strategy.<br\/><br\/>I wish to reinforce what a number of people said earlier.  There will be no going back to a situation in which developers can buy their way out of Part V obligations.  That is not going to happen, and we are going to create an acceptance and an understanding and, hopefully, a non-issue of the fact that a certain percentage of every new housing estate will be allocated for social housing, affordable housing, special needs housing or whatever.  If we cannot manage that as a society, the comments made by Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in<b><\/b>ring true.  We need to create an understanding, an acceptance and a reality that when one drives into a housing estate one does not notice the difference between social housing and private housing but sees an estate that is diverse, with a mix of different family types and sizes and challenges and all the other things that people face in their lives.  I am determined to do that in the context of our housing strategy.  I do not want to build acres and acres of social housing to try to meet a need and facilitate the building of acres of private housing in some other part of the city where the two communities are not integrating.  The stigma that gets built up around that needs to be addressed head-on.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we are committed to doing that.  It is in the programme for Government and we will try to make that happen as soon as we can.  As the former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey, has pointed out, we will support this motion.  It is a good motion and is timely in the context of the Government's response to housing need next week.  I look forward to coming back to the House to work through the detail not only in respect of the disability elements of the housing strategy but the broader strategy itself.  I thank all Senators for their comments.  I know we are not discussing bins today.  The debate has been constructive and helpful and I will try to take on board as much of it as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#VV00200","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>The points I wanted to make have been eloquently made and it is great to see consensus, particularly around the area of congregated settings.

I join others in commending Senator John Dolan on tabling a very opportune, appropriate and detailed Private Members' motion.  He is no stranger to advocacy work and has been involved in the disability movement for many years through his role as CEO of the Disability Federation of Ireland.  I acknowledge the representatives of the DFI who are in the House today as well as other organisations and Elaine Howley, the head of advocacy in the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  I wish her well in her new role.<\/p> <p>It is true to say that people with disabilities have been very adversely affected in recent years as a result of the recession and of decisions made by the previous Government and the one before to make cuts in respite care and adaptation grants given to councillors to facilitate people, especially older people who acquire a disability later in life and require help to remain in their homes.  Those measures could and should have been avoided but were not.  Governments make choices but they could easily have made alternative choices.<\/p> <p>There should not be tax cuts in the next budget and future budgets because we do not need tax cuts.  We need investment in public services, housing and our health services in order that they are brought up to a standard that is fit for purpose and in line with international standards.  We have a housing crisis and I believe the Government is committed to resolving it.  A plan will be published next week which will be a starting measure to address the housing crisis.  I am comforted by the Minister's words this evening to the effect that people with disabilities would be an integral part of the plan.<\/p> <p>I welcome the various strategies in which many people in the House have been involved.  Senator Kelleher has done a lot of work on the strategies, especially in Cork.  It is appropriate that we have local strategies because what is appropriate for Limerick city may not be right for Mayo or Clare.  Localised strategies can identify how best the public purse can be used to the maximum effect to ensure people have independent living and that those who have the wherewithal, desire and ability to live in their own homes can have their homes modified to their needs.<\/p> <p>We are coming from behind on this but we have to be positive going forward.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann has a significant role to play in reminding Government of its duties to all citizens of this country.  This motion does that and I am glad the Government has decided to support it.  It is the right thing to do.  This House has a tradition of coming together when something is the right thing to do.  In the previous Seanad there were motions on important issues like direct provision and I am glad we are coming together to support this motion and send a clear message to Government that this is an issue about which Seanad &Eacute;ireann cares and in support of which it will come together.  I am hopeful that, with the confidence and supply agreement that is in place and with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il and Independents, the Government will have the necessary resources, confidence and competence to make a significant dent in what is a very difficult and challenging situation.  If the Government is to run for five years, which is most unlikely, I hope we can come back here and celebrate success as we see the numbers dropping due to the collective efforts and energy of us all, with public representatives such as ourselves advocating and reminding and the Government delivering.  In the ideal world anybody with a disability who wished to live at home and within the community would be facilitated and we may get to that at some time.  Until then our progress needs to be accelerated and every measure needs to be taken to ensure that more people benefit from the ultimate desire we all have.<\/p> <p>Many good ideas have been put forward today and Senator Craughwell's suggestion on VAT is worthy of consideration.  We have to think outside the box to resolve these issues.  The Minister said that the housing strategy to be published next week will be a fluid document and will be considered a work in progress, which is right and proper.  If more resources become available they should be put into resolving the problems.  There should be logical localised solutions, as what works in Cork may not work in Mayo and what works in Mayo may not work in Carlow.  The possibility of various organisations, including NGOs, working together needs to be explored and actioned.<\/p> <p>I wish the Minister well and I am encouraged by his words.

As a health care professional, having worked as an occupational therapist for the past eight years, I have worked with many people who have suffered from disability and have been involved with many who needed housing adaptations.  I bring that experience to the motion.  I am mindful of what the Minister said about the wealth of experience of this issue in the Seanad.<\/p><p>As legislators, we must work to ensure that our country provides appropriate and adequate housing for those with disabilities.  No individuals in this State should be disadvantaged in their access to accommodation because they suffer from a disability.  The figures presented in the context of this motion are very stark.  We are working on figures for 2013 which show that almost 4,000 people on the housing list have a disability.  We must make sure these applications are progressed and processed as quickly as possible.  We all await the action plan on housing which is to be announced next week.  It is important that time was taken to consider that because it is cross-departmental, and it is the same for people with a disability.  This crosses the Departments of Health, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Children and Youth Affairs.  We need to make sure that people with disabilities are involved in that process.  I welcome what the Minister said about the action plan being a working document and that there will be consideration of which changes are positive and which need to be amended.<\/p><p>I want to focus on two issues, the first of which is the provision of housing adaptation grants and the barriers and challenges for people with a disability.  The grants provide older people and people with a disability with an opportunity to continue independent living in their own homes for as long as possible.  There has been an increase in funding for 2016, which is a very important and positive step.  In my county of Roscommon, the allocation for this year was &euro;945,000, up from &euro;811,000 in 2015.  These grants are absolutely vital for people with a disability in order to support modifications required within their homes.  It is very important that the grants are processed as efficiently as possible.  I have worked with many individuals who have to stay an unnecessary length of time in hospital or in convalescence because of a delay in processing applications.  It is for local authorities to process the applications but it is important that the Government takes an active role in making sure the targets are met.  I would like the Minister to review the threshold for household income.  It is based on the property owner&rsquo;s annual gross income together with the spouse or partner&rsquo;s annual gross income in the previous tax year.  Where there are combined earnings of over &euro;60,000, an individual is ineligible.  Having worked as an occupational therapist in the health service, I know of many families who have had to pay the entire cost of modifications because they are slightly over the threshold.  It is exceptionally difficult for them to pay all the costs of renovation and they often end up having to pay private care and home support costs as well.  The threshold should be reviewed to assist as many people as possible who have a disability.  It is difficult enough for them without added financial stress if they do not meet that threshold.  <\/p><p>My second issue is that the motion refers specifically to the significant numbers of people with disabilities living in nursing homes or similar facilities.  Many of these people are very young and could be more appropriately accommodated in a hospital setting.  I found it very upsetting in my previous job to see young people who have real potential being discharged to a long-term care facility.  It is inappropriate and should not happen.  These people deserve better.  We need to look towards supporting the best quality of life for them.  Long-term care in a facility where they are surrounded by older people is not the right way to support them and ensure that their potential is reached.  There have been steps to move towards more community care and away from institutional settings but there needs to be a stronger focus on this aspect.  There needs to be a middle ground to support young people, who have so much potential, in an appropriate community setting.  In many cases it is difficult for them to be accommodated in their own homes.  I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, and with the Senators who have a real passion for, and commitment to, supporting people with disabilities.  Today we had a really important debate, earmarking the fact that people with disabilities need support and a voice and that we will do what we can to help them.  While this debate is on housing, it deals with much more than that because it crosses so many Departments.  That needs to be incorporated into the action plan for housing which will be launched next week. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#XX00300","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>It is very difficult for me to honour the contributions, thoughtfulness, passion and interest of Members across the House over the past two hours.<\/p> <p>The Minister acknowledged the knowledge of this issue in the Seanad, among Senators who have participated in it at local authority level and those with personal experience.  He talked about the launch of the action plan next Tuesday being a good start.  Things have to happen over the next two or three years.  The demographic is going against us.  It is good news in the sense that many people are living longer.  Senator Hopkins and I have talked about people with strokes who would have died ten or 15 years ago and who now live, but do so with the legacy of it.  They need support.  We do not know who it will be tomorrow or next week but we know that will happen to some people.  We need to outflank this issue, not just catch up.  As a society, we have to get ahead of the problem.  That is a stretch but it can be done and it is for the betterment of society.  The Minister said the Government does give this issue priority and that commitment will be further reinforced next week.  We look forward to that.<\/p> <p>After the Second Stage debate on the Seanad Bill 2016 when people with knowledge and experience spoke there was a lovely example of people bringing experience to the debate on this motion.  I need not have put so much energy into my original contribution because people took it and went with it and there was a great flow of information, ideas and commitment.  The Minister offered to come back and take statements.  It is very positive that the Minister and the Department are engaged on this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister and the Department engaged, and if this afternoon is anything to go by it is not alone a case of their being engaged but of their being able to bring something to the table.  There are many organisations present who are interested in the debate.  We have a triumvirate of interests trying to find practical ways to coalesce.  I accept there are tensions.  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned some of them, for example, members of local authorities putting their money where their mouth is, and local communities saying something is very fine but they do not want it here.  Senator Conway talked about the fact that we do not need tax cuts, we need public services.  The services are not just for disabled people.  Without doing any in-depth research I can tell the House that at least 50,000 people will have a disability of one kind or another between now and this day next year who do not have one today.  They will not all need housing support.  It is not a case of \"the disabled\", there are people who will become disabled and we must plan for that contingency.  That is clearly what this is about.<\/p><p>I was very pleased to hear the Minister underline in his concluding remarks what the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said two weeks ago, namely, about the commitment of the Government to ratification of Article 19 of the UN convention.  I did not mention that point but other speakers did.  I am happy to leave it at that and to thank everybody.  We look forward to pursuing the matter and also to working with the officials in the Department and many others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#YY00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468402200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1468402200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Ag 10.30 a.m. maidin am&aacute;rach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016071300002#ZZ00400","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468402200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 July 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
