Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  <\/p>  <p>  ISDS, which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS has, however, proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.  In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest.  <\/p>  <p>  ICS addressees the concerns around the old ISDS system through:<\/p>  <p>  - Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;<\/p>  <p>  - Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;<\/p>  <p>  - Provisions for the swift dismissal of frivolous claims should they arise;<\/p>  <p>  - The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;<\/p>  <p>  - The avoidance of multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and national courts, and;<\/p>  <p>  - The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.<\/p>  <p>  The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve:<\/p>  <p>  - a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases; and  <\/p>  <p>  - precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  CETA introduces a precise and specific standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\" of investors and investment.  Therefore, an investor may only have recourse to the Investment Court System (ICS) in very specific limited grounds such as in the case of the denial of justice, or a fundamental breach of due process, or through targeted discrimination for example on the grounds of race, religious belief or gender.  None of these measures give the Government any concern that Ireland would be subject to ICS proceedings.  Moreover, it is important to note that under the ICS a State can never be forced to change its legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly under the specific grounds detailed.  An investor cannot be given compensation just because they have lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs. <\/p>  <p>  As one of the first &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; EU Free Trade Agreements, CETA contains a dedicated chapter on Trade and the Environment.  The Agreement has some of the strongest commitments ever included in a trade deal to promote labour rights, environmental protection and sustainable development.  CETA integrates the EU's and Canada's commitments to apply international rules on workers' rights, environmental protection and climate action.  These obligations are binding, with the same legal value as any other provision.<\/p>  <p>  CETA also reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection.<\/p>  <p>  Under CETA, Canadian firms are placed on an equal footing with their EU competitors, including in relation to access to mining and prospecting investment.  This means that Canadian companies must comply with all EU and national legislation in the EU countries where they operate (in the same way as EU companies), and they must not be subject to discriminatory rules.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the finalising of the Agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding Joint Interpretative Instrument (JII) that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  CETA does not affect EU rules on food safety or the environment.  Neither does it restrict the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety.  Importantly, in CETA both sides also agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection go hand in hand.<\/p>  <p>  CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety.  Nor does CETA affect the Government&rsquo;s scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  CETA includes commitments towards the sustainable management of forests, fisheries and aquaculture.  It also includes commitments to cooperate on trade-related environmental issues of common interest such as climate change where the implementation of the Paris Agreement will be an important shared responsibility for the European Union and its Member States and Canada.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[6168\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to difficulties faced by parents in accessing essential items for their children, especially young children, and specifically shoes, which they grow out of quickly and which need to be measured; and if he will examine same (details supplied).","asker":"1604","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, only essential retail outlets will remain open.

We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.<\/p><p>As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes, to re-start their business.

This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.<\/p><p>The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021.

The Agreement covers virtually every aspect of economic activity and will provide new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms given the extensive bilateral business links between Ireland and Canada.  Indeed, outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market.  More than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients are doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people.  Since the commencement of provisional application, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed.  Furthermore, exports of Irish goods and services to Canada totalled approximately &euro;3.9 billion in 2019, a 35% increase compared to 2016, the last full year, prior to the provisional application of CETA.<\/p><p>Provisional application is a standard mechanism provided for in the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the Agreement has been voted for by Council and the European Parliament.  It is an important mechanism that allows companies and consumers to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take a number of years. To date, 15 Member States have signaled to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union the completion of their respective national ratification procedures while several other Member States are currently progressing approval of the Agreement, most recently Romania in December 2020.  <\/p><p>The provisions that are in force since 21st September 2017 include the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers, and more transparent rules for market access.<\/p><p>Moreover, the benefits and opportunities to business in the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) - in areas such as regulatory co-operation, trade facilitation measures, streamlined administration etc., will directly benefit Irish consumers. CETA will scrap or cut almost all the customs duties which EU importers have to pay on goods coming from Canada.  As well as final products, the cost of parts, components and other inputs goods used to make final products also falls.  This is the case already under provisional application of the Agreement.  So, consumers can potentially enjoy lower prices and a wider choice of products and services, but only if the Canadian import satisfies all EU product rules including social and environmental standards, as well as people's health and safety and consumer rights.<\/p><p>The benefits and opportunities to business in the agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  Indeed, CETA contains an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at addressing those specific constraints that might otherwise limit SMEs taking full advantage of the improved EU-Canada trade agreement market access.  <\/p><p>In services and investment CETA is the most far-reaching agreement the EU has ever concluded. Almost half of the benefits anticipated from CETA are expected in the services sector.  CETA makes it easier for EU individuals and companies to provide services to Canadian customers and vice versa.  It covers services such as legal, accountancy, transport and telecoms.  There are considerable opportunities for Ireland given our strengths in services where Ireland has been particularly successful in expanding its share of the world&rsquo;s services market in recent years with services exports accounting for approximately 60% of all exports in 2019.  In this regard, there are a range of sectoral opportunities for Irish companies in Canada, including &ndash;<\/p><p>- Financial software,<\/p><p>- telecoms sector,<\/p><p>- digital media, content and gaming,<\/p><p>- education and e-learning,<\/p><p>- agritech\/engineering,<\/p><p>- life sciences and<\/p><p>- digital health and consumer retail.<\/p><p>The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise.<\/p><p>All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  ISDS, which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS has been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties but has proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.  In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest.  ICS is the Investment Dispute Settlement system incorporated in CETA. <\/p><p>To this end, investors may utilise either national courts or the ICS, but cannot &quot;forum-shop&quot;.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can seek to sue the government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our Courts whether CETA exists or not.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative.  However, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the Courts, cannot find any act by Government to be <i>ultra vires<\/i>or unconstitutional - it is only concerned with redress for proven harm.<\/p><p>ICS itself addressees the criticisms of the old ISDS system through:<\/p><p>- Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;<\/p><p>- Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;<\/p><p>- Provisions for the swift dismissal of frivolous claims should they arise;<\/p><p>- The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;<\/p><p>- The avoidance of multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and national courts, and;<\/p><p>- The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.<\/p><p>The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve:<\/p><p>- a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;<\/p><p>- the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications &ndash; comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases; and  <\/p><p>- precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.<\/p><p>Irish companies investing in Canada have only one legal system and one constitutional framework to navigate should they believe they have been discriminated against.  In contrast, Canadian companies investing in Europe are faced with 27 legal systems and constitutions.  The Investment Court System provides a single, consistent mechanism where investors, be they Canadian or European, can seek redress.<\/p><p>It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning measures relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, or minimum alcohol pricing can continue to be introduced.  <\/p><p>CETA introduces a precise and specific standard of &quot;fair and equitable treatment&quot; of investors and investment.  Therefore, an investor may only have recourse to the Investment Court System (ICS) in very specific limited grounds such as in the case of the denial of justice, or a fundamental breach of due process, or through targeted discrimination for example on the grounds of race, religious belief or gender.  None of these measures give the Government any concern that Ireland would be subject to ICS proceedings.  Moreover, it is important to note that under the ICS a State can never be forced to change its legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly under the specific grounds detailed.  An investor cannot be given compensation just because they have lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs.  <\/p><p>In September 2017, Belgium requested the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the compatibility of the ICS with EU law. The Opinion of the Court in Case 1\/17 was issued on 30th April 2019 and held that the dispute settlement mechanism in CETA is compatible with EU law and complies with (i) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, (ii) the principle of equal treatment and of the requirement of effectiveness of EU law, and (iii) the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular of the right of access to a court and right to an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter.<\/p><p>The rules for the functioning of the CETA Appellate Tribunal have now been set out.  These rules will ensure an effective two-step investigation including an appeal function, bringing it more in line with the structure operating at WTO level.  In addition to the Tribunal, and the Appellate Tribunal, CETA also provides for rules for Mediation, an area which traditional investment agreements have largely overlooked, with the objective of facilitating the finding of a mutually agreed solution with the assistance of a mediator, without the requirement to access the Tribunal.  A code of conduct for the judges of the ICS has also been established, to further bolster the assurances of the highest ethics standards already contained in the agreement.  <\/p><p>Turning to the environment, as one of the first &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; EU Free Trade Agreements, CETA contains a dedicated chapter on Trade and the Environment.  The Agreement has some of the strongest commitments ever included in a trade deal to promote labour rights, environmental protection and sustainable development.  CETA integrates the EU's and Canada's commitments to apply international rules on workers' rights, environmental protection and climate action.  These obligations are binding, with the same legal value as any other provision.<\/p><p>CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety.  Nor does CETA affect the Government&rsquo;s scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  CETA includes commitments towards the sustainable management of forests, fisheries and aquaculture.  It also includes commitments to cooperate on trade-related environmental issues of common interest such as climate change where the implementation of the Paris Agreement will be an important shared responsibility for the European Union and its Member States and Canada.<\/p><p>As part of the finalising of the Agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding Joint Interpretative Instrument (JII) that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  It is important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives.  Importantly, in CETA both sides also agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection go hand in hand.<\/p><p>Regarding Ireland&rsquo;s own ratification, given that there can be no doubt that CETA is a progressive, high-standard agreement, I believe our own credibility in promoting open and fair global trade would be undermined if we are not in a position to ratify this Agreement.<\/p><p>As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we fully support balanced international trade and the suite of EU Free Trade Agreements that seek to underpin this.  Equally, Ireland has been an attractive destination for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for many decades and participating in EU-Third Country Agreements that address Investment Protection continue to assist marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to make their investments with the attendant jobs and prosperity that that entails.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on referring CETA to an Oireachtas Committee, I believe the Committee on European Union Affairs would be best placed to carry out an informed and timely discussion. I look forward to the opportunity of bringing the relevant motion forward to the D&aacute;il in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB05400"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[6897\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB05500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if Ireland has bilateral investment treaties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>Ireland has no Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) with 3rd Countries. <\/p>  <p>  Following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, the European Commission was conferred with the competence to act on behalf of Member States in relation to trade and investment treaties, including BITs. Therefore, Member States have not concluded BITs with 3rd countries since the adoption of the Treaty.  Moreover, where the Commission has concluded investment treaties with 3rd countries, Member States&rsquo; own BITs have been superseded.<\/p>  <p>  Member States with intra-EU BITs signed the Agreement for the Termination of Intra-EU Bilateral Investment Treaties in May 2020 which came into force on 29 August 2020. 10 Member States have since ratified the Agreement in their national parliaments.  This termination agreement implements the March 2018 European Court of Justice judgment (in the Achmea case).  Thus, pre-accession BITs between EU Member States are in the process of being terminated.  Moreover, within the Union, the rules of the Single Market and competition apply.<\/p>  <p>  Historically, Ireland has benefitted from very strong investment inflows, reflecting investor confidence in the Irish legal system.  However, increasingly investment by overseas firms in Ireland is accompanied by investments in other EU Member States and multiple legal  and redress systems in Europe can present a disincentive relevant to other competitor locations.  Equally, outward investment by firms in Ireland has not generated significant demand for the adoption of bilateral agreements, but as more Irish firms scale and seek to internationalise investment protection becomes a more important concern. On behalf of the Member States, the EU now seeks to negotiate Investment Protection Agreements with 3rd Countries such as those recently concluded with Singapore and with Vietnam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000059#WRB05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":82,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 25 to 28, inclusive, answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000060#WRC00100"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[6918\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000060#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the measures he will put in place to support SMEs in the used car sales sector in the wake of the commencement of crippling post-Brexit tariffs; if he will help secure access to Brexit support funding for such enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>My Department and its agencies have put a wide range of Brexit enterprise measures in place, covering potential Brexit impacts.

A major upgrade of the CRO IT system went live with effect from 16th December 2020. This was a significant modernisation project which greatly increases the range of documents that can be filed electronically, with resulting efficiency gains for both business and the CRO.  The new CRO cloud-based IT platform is designed to provide improved and faster user experience for presenters and a fully paperless interaction with the CRO for certain transactions, including the most common ones carried out by companies such as the filing of annual returns and the changing of directors and their details. The introduction of a fully paperless system for these transactions provides certainty of delivery for companies.

However, if an employer cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments due to financial difficulties or insolvency the State provides a safety net for both employers and employees.

The employer does not have to be insolvent for the Department of Social Protection to make these payments on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is raised against the employer.

The rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, or ongoing commitment to the Irish economy, thus benefitting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies. At the time the rebate was ceased it was not deemed a targeted use of resources. In contrast, the Redundancy Payments Scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to make statutory redundancy payments. The Scheme considers both an employer&rsquo;s ability to pay and that the Social Insurance Fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if an employer&rsquo;s financial position improves.

notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection. In general, this end to end process can typically take between 15 and 18 months. <\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.

In April of last year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.<\/p><p>In January of this year, ComReg published a market research survey on the impact of Covid-19 on consumer usage and satisfaction of telecommunications in Ireland for 2020 since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced.

My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard as they operate in a fully liberalised market regulated by ComReg as independent regulator.<\/p><p>The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract.

This campaign was also supported by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Business Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p><p>This communication campaign served to reinforce the message that there is maritime capacity available to transport goods directly to Continental Europe and that these options are many and varied across different modalities (ro-ro, con-ro, lo-lo) providing both accompanied and unaccompanied options to exporters. <\/p><p>We have witnessed throughout 2020 and at the beginning of 2021 an unprecedented response from the shipping industry in terms of increasing capacity to match market demand. It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. <\/p><p><b>Number of Sailings<\/b><\/p><p>As of January 2021, there are around 60 RoRo freight sailings between Ireland and the Continent in a typical week. This includes five shipping operators, Irish Ferries, Stena Line, DFDS, Brittany Ferries and CLDN offering both accompanied and unaccompanied freight. This represents an increase of around 34 sailings per week, or around 130% increase in continental RoRo frequency compared to January 2020. <\/p><p>Specifically in relation to sailings between Ireland and France, in January 2020, there were 12 weekly sailings to and from Northern France. These were provided by Irish Ferries and Stena Line to the port of Cherbourg (not including the seasonal service operated by Brittany Ferries to Roscoff). In the last 12 months, the number of sailings to Northern France has increased by 25. Based on published schedules, there are now over 36 sailings per week to and from the ports of Dunkerque and Cherbourg, Roscoff and St Malo provided by Stena Line, Irish Ferries, DFDS and Brittany Ferries. <\/p><p><b>Freight Capacity<\/b><\/p><p>The increase in choice and frequency in the RoRo freight market over the past year has had a very significant impact on freight capacity to continental EU ports. Weekly RoRo freight capacity to continental EU ports has doubled in the past 12 months. There is now capacity for approximately 5,000 additional HGV&rsquo;s &amp;amp; unaccompanied trailers on continental RoRo services per week in January 2021. <\/p><p>The largest increase in capacity has come on RoRo services to Northern France. In January 2020, capacity to Northern France represented 35% of all continental EU capacity. As of January 2021, it now accounts for 49%.<\/p><p>Unaccompanied RoRo freight is an essential component of continental RoRo capacity. In 2020, unaccompanied RoRo freight made up over 80%<b><\/b>of all continental RoRo volume.

Where a pre-1989 licence holder did not tick the box they would no longer retain that entitlement.  However, the entitlement could be restored up to ten years after last holding it.  If they let the entitlement to drive with a trailer lapse for longer, they must apply as learners for the purposes of driving with a trailer. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the then Minister for Transport received representations from the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association suggesting that many farmers who had a car licence before the 1989 regulations came into effect, had unintentionally lost their trailer entitlement by not ticking the appropriate box on the renewal form.

Other small firms have been similarly locked out of the CRSS - for various reasons - and that is why the Government responded yesterday with further supports to target such businesses.

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services. The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6 months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  A total of 64 licensed commercial operators throughout the country are being assisted under this scheme. <\/p>  <p>  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of March 2021 and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, or &lsquo;CRSS&rsquo;, which offers temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to Covid-19 of up to &euro;5,000 per week.<\/p>  <p>  A full list of enterprise measures is available on the website of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000065#WRH04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Driver Licensing Service","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000065#WRH05000"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[6723\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000065#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which National Driver Licensing Service centres are operating during Covid-19 (details supplied); if he will provide clarity on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is responsible for the National Driving Licence Service (NDLS). <\/p><p>The NDLS resumed services in June, following the closure of the centres due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.

Such measures included, for a fifth or subsequent permit, an increase in the cost of the permit; a decrease in the duration of a permit; a requirement to take mandatory lessons with an approved driving instructor and a requirement to take a driving test before another permit can be issued. The objective is to make it a disincentive to rely long term on a learner permit. These measures took account of the shorter wait times for tests and the increased tester resources that were available to the RSA at the end of 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposal was examined and a policy decision was made to amend the law. However, since then, urgent measures introduced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic have taken precedence and the proposals will need to be re-examined in light of current conditions. The cessation of services in March 2020 and further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions in 2020 and  2021 has led to a backlog of people awaiting driving tests. Therefore, it would be prudent to delay any changes to regulations to make it mandatory for long term permit holders to sit a test until the driving test service has stabilised.

The scheme will continue during 2021 and the Government will decide on the form of its extension when economic conditions are clearer, guided by what the economy requires at that time to support the expected economic recovery. <\/p>  <p>  In November, the Government also agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the sector. My Department is currently engaging with the European Commission regarding formal approval of this package which will be implemented in line with EU State aid rules. <\/p>  <p>  Any additional supports designed to facilitate growth of air traffic can only be progressed at the appropriate time, taking account of the outlook for the easing of travel restrictions and improving wider epidemiological conditions. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis in consultation with relevant Government Ministers and all key stakeholders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000066#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coast Guard Service","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000066#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[6982\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000066#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to expand the Irish Coast Guard station in Howth, County Dublin; if plans for the leasing of the land by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to his Department in order to facilitate this expansion can be finalised without delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>Howth Coast Guard Station is currently on the OPW Building Maintenance Programme for a proposed extension to the rear of the station.

The Subgroup on social matters related to aircrews (of the Expert Group on the Aviation Internal Market) was created as a key deliverable of the Social report on aviation COM(2019) 120 final. Its aim is to bring together experts both from the aviation side and the employment side of the national administrations to ensure cooperation and coordination on the implementation of EU legislation in relation to aircrews, to share information, and to exchange views on good practices and on how labour law rules may be better enforced in relation to aircrews in order to ensure fair working conditions and a level playing field. Two priority topics were identified by this sub-group for initial attention:  self-employment and enforcement of applicable law relating to aircrew and work is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the extensive laws in place in relation to employment and protection of workers, any change should be clearly evidence based and ensure appropriate consideration of issues such as enterprise development, innovation and expanded employment opportunities. Ireland has consistently argued that matters related to employment rights should continue to be developed on an economy wide basis and not on a sector specific basis.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with all stakeholders and relevant departments in relation to these matters, including the issues raised by some Member States in their joint statement on 9 December.

It is important to remember that driver licensing law exists to ensure that people licensed to drive on our roads meet high standards of safety. The standards for testing drivers are set at EU level. If you are resident in Ireland you must have a EU licence.  The Deputy will be aware of this from his previous position in Government with responsibility for Diaspora matters.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a driving licence exchange agreement with the United States of America, therefore a USA licence can not be exchanged for an Irish licence.  Indeed, as the licensing authorities in the USA are generally the States (as with Canada), any exchange agreement could only be reached with individual States.  However due to the mutual recognition for exchange purposes among States, any State's licence must be assessed by the standards of all the States.<\/p>  <p>  Bilateral agreements on licence exchange are reached only when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes, so that each side can be satisfied that they are compatible. <\/p>  <p>  As Ireland does not have an exchange agreement with the USA, there is no recognised standard of testing which people have met.  In that regard, it is worth noting that the road safety record of US States are generally not comparable with those of EU Member States. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals with licences issued by States in the USA are required to go through the national driver learning process in order to obtain an Irish driving licence. In recognition of holders of a full but non-exchange licence, such applicants can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and will not have to wait the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.<\/p>  <p>  There is a distinction between motorists visiting Ireland and those living in Ireland. For non-residents, currently under the Convention on Road Traffic 1949 (Geneva Convention), drivers from Contracting States carrying a valid driver&rsquo;s licence can drive on each other&rsquo;s roads for up to a year.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge, due to suspension of the driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed.  <\/p>  <p>  The need to once again return to level 5 restrictions for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing. During the level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work. <\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. Sanction has recently been provided to hire 40 additional temporary driver testers, along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000067#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Development Agency","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000067#WRK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[7208\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000067#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the discussions he has had with the Land Development Agency with regard to the Coonagh-Knockalisheen Road and Moyross, County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

State grants, where applicable, are intended to supplement the funding allocated to the maintenance and improvement of roads by local authorities from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.

In this context a number of regional and local road improvement projects were identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP and the construction of a Coonagh to Knockalisheen Distributor Road (CKDR) is one of those schemes.

In addition, we cannot compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups, nor can we require them to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I can assure you that insurance reform is a priority for this Government, with a view to improving the insurance environment, including for sports and community based groups. In this regard, the recently-launched Action Plan for Insurance Reform contains a range of deliverables, including:<\/p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency through the National Claims Information Database (NCID), including for employer and public liability insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - reviewing the duty of care legislation;<\/p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;<\/p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions;<\/p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and,<\/p>  <p>  - making proposals on increasing competition in the Irish insurance market. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising that many sports and community-based groups need to see the impact of these reforms as soon as possible, the Action Plan contains 66 actions, 95% of which are due to be completed by the end of 2021. The focus is clearly on completing these actions in the short to medium term.  As such, I am hopeful that key reforms around personal injury awards may start to have an impact during this year on the pricing and availability of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s query relating to forbearance with respect to sports clubs, I would note that Insurance Ireland last month (27 January) announced a continuance of such measures on behalf of a number of its members. Both Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to raise the issue through engagement with insurers in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work with our Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL02500"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[6809\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will extend the terms of the Covid restrictions support scheme to include businesses that do not have a fixed premises;

A fund of &euro;10 million (Coach Tourism Business Continuity Scheme) was put in place by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to support the coach tourism sector.<\/p><p>In addition, Deputies will be aware of the Tourism Business Continuity scheme, a &euro;55m strategic funding scheme announced as part of Budget 2021 to support tourism businesses which was launched last week.

Each business must meet the qualification criteria in their own right.<\/p><p>I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or to introduce sectoral supports. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme.

Payments made under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  They are therefore liable to income tax as is the general position that applies to social welfare payments. <\/p><p>Similar to other income earners whose pay was not subsidised by the State, including those on comparable wages, TWSS payments were also subject to USC. <\/p><p>It is noted, however, that a zero rate of PRSI applied for the purposes of employee PRSI contributions under the TWSS while the PUP is exempt of PRSI, as is also the case for regular social welfare payments.<\/p><p>An additional exemption being made to such payments would raise questions around equity and it is therefore appropriate that payments made under the TWSS and PUP are subject to tax.  <\/p><p>Tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the schemes were in operation.  Instead, liability to tax has now been calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most, when the TWSS was first announced and expected to only be in place for 12 weeks.  <\/p><p>When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;<i>week 1 basis<\/i>&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end.<\/p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020 and re-established the normal requirement to operate PAYE on all employee salaries, providing for the regular deduction and remittance of income tax, USC and employee PRSI.<\/p><p>In terms of the total outstanding from the 2020 tax year, the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on their personal circumstances.  However, based on data that Revenue released in January, almost half of those in receipt of the PUP or TWSS have no outstanding liability to discharge, and in in fact over a third are due a refund worth an estimated total of around &euro;151 million.<\/p><p>In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicate that the total amount outstanding from those in receipt of either the TWSS or PUP (or both) is around &euro;335 million.  It is noted that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000.  If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week.  These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  <\/p><p>This information was published and is available to view on Revenue&rsquo;s website:<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In terms of the steps being taken to assist persons with an outstanding liability, I note that Revenue has also given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities remain following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with taxpayers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022.

The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.<\/p><p>Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.<\/p><p>When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments\/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL06400"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[6513\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify the situation regarding the restricted entitlement for pensioners to drawdown funding from private pension investments which appear to discriminate against persons that have a reduced rate of State pension relative to those that are in receipt of the full State pension (contributory); the reason the State,  through its financial regulations, would make it more difficult on persons in receipt of a smaller income to withdraw funds from their own private pension investments than it is for those that have larger pensions and perhaps other income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring for the requirement for certain holders of Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) to retain a portion of their pension savings in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF).<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) provides that an individual in a defined contribution pension savings arrangement has the option of putting the funds accumulated under the arrangement into an ARF on retirement, subject to conditions. <\/p>  <p>  If, at the time of exercising an option, such an individual is under the age of 75 and does not meet the requirement in section 784C(4) TCA of having a minimum guaranteed pension income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum, including a pension payable under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, then s\/he is required under that section to set aside an amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension fund if less than &euro;63,500 after taking a retirement lump sum) by investing the amount in an AMRF or by the purchase of an annuity. <\/p>  <p>  An AMRF automatically becomes an ARF when the owner either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75 years, and the amount of funds in the AMRF at that time can be drawn down at the owner&rsquo;s discretion under ARF rules. <\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the minimum guaranteed pension income condition applying to the ARF option is to ensure that, where this condition is not met, there is a capital nest egg available to the individual in older age.  This condition has been in place since the inception of ARFs in 1999.  At that time, the minimum income requirement was set at IR&pound;10,000 which, on the introduction of the Euro in 2002, converted to its Euro equivalent of &euro;12,700.  This was significantly higher than the maximum rate of the contributory State pension payable in 1999 (IR&pound;4,628, equivalent to &euro;5,876) so there was no intended link between the State pension and the minimum guaranteed income limit. <\/p>  <p>  However, the contributory State pension has more than doubled since 1999 while the minimum guaranteed pension test for ARF purposes remains at &euro;12,700.  As the Deputy indicates, the State Pension (Contributory) now exceeds &euro;12,700 for individuals who have 48 or more annual contributions on average, which means such individuals do not have to put a portion of their pension savings into an AMRF.  Also, the Revenue Pensions Manual states that Revenue will allow individuals who receive from the Department of Social Protection a Christmas bonus payment, a fuel allowance payment, household benefit package and\/or telephone support allowance to take these payments into account for the purpose of the specified income requirement in section 784C TCA.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) was recently published.  The IDPRTG Report recommends a range of reforms to the ARF, including abolishing the AMRF requirement.  The conclusions in the report represent a building block for a significant piece of long-term structural reform in the area of supplementary pension provision. In relation to the overall IDPRTG Report an implementatoin plan is currently being considered by that Group.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":514,"content":"<p>Question No. 196 answered with Question No. 187.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL06800"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[6557\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000068#WRL06900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who availed of the help-to-buy scheme in Cork city and county in each of the years 2011 to 2020 and to date in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive was introduced in 2017.

In particular, I noted what was likely to be a significant reduction in claims for this period due to the travel restrictions that were in place at that time. This ultimately resulted in a number of insurers announcing a range of forbearance measures and motor insurance rebates for policyholders. In addition, insurers have agreed to further review the situation if extended Covid-19 restrictions on movement result in sustained lower road usage and claims frequency this year.<\/p><p>Most recently as part of a comprehensive engagement on the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda with a wide range of stakeholder interests, including Insurance Ireland, Minister of State Fleming concluded a series of meetings with the main Irish insurers.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis. <\/p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19 and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be experiencing difficulty for the first time.  These borrowers will continue to need, and will be expected to obtain, assistance and support from their lenders; this point has been made clear to lenders and has been accepted by them.  Indeed in their recent 8 January statement, the BPFI reiterated that lenders were continuing to commit significant resources to those borrowers affected by the latest restrictions and that they are working with their customers to find solutions which meet individual circumstances.  At this stage, rather than continuing with a general 'one size fits all' forbearance approach, it is considered that it is in the best long term interests of both the borrower and lender that engagement takes place in relation to a particular mortgage or other loan difficulty and that the most appropriate solution to the individual case - which can either be a short term or a long term restructure &ndash; is adopted as soon as possible.  In such a context, the Central Bank has nevertheless confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering further payment breaks to borrowers, provided that they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to credit rating and records, it should be noted that lenders have an obligation to report information on all mortgage and other loans to the Central Credit Register. The Central Credit Register, which is under the remit of the Central Bank, does not produce credit ratings or credit scores.

Bodies procuring public works projects must comply with the provisions of the CWMF which contains extensive guidance covering all aspects of the procurement and contract administration stages.  Specific guidance and templates are also published to manage the pre-qualification stage of a procurement process.  It is important, when assessing the financial standing and technical capacity of a contractor to undertake a particular project, that the contracting authority should set standards that are proportionate to the project and its associated risks.<\/p>  <p>  To provide targeted assistance to contracting authorities on this important stage of the procurement process guidance note GN 2.3.1.3 - Minimum Standards for Suitability Works Contractor Criteria (Open, Restricted Procedure) have been published. This guidance note sets out standards under each of the criteria that may be used to assess a contractor&rsquo;s financial standing and technical ability.  <\/p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) contains provisions ensuring access to the public procurement markets of both parties. The EU and UK have agreed to zero tariffs and zero quotas on products that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms, as well as provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition, as part of a larger economic cooperation. <\/p>  <p>  Title VI of the Agreement, which sets out the provisions relating to public procurement, goes beyond commitments under the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), to which the UK has acceded. EU companies will be able to participate on an equal footing with UK companies in bids for procurement tenders covered by the agreement, and vice versa.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement further provides for non-discrimination of EU companies established in the UK (and vice versa) for national procurement, i.e. below the current thresholds of the GPA. The Agreement also allows the use of its bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms for disputes that might arise in regards to the procurement opportunities subject to the GPA.<\/p>  <p>  The NI Protocol which forms part of the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to avoid a hard border on this island, the Common Travel Area provides additional rights to UK and Irish citizens to live and work in both jurisdictions.  The combined effect of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, the NI Protocol and the Common Travel Area means that procurement opportunities in both jurisdictions remain open to businesses on both sides of the border and the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03400"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[7245\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the restrictions and appropriateness of companies with unlimited status from being awarded contracts as part of the public procurement process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[7246\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the restrictions and appropriateness of companies registered in jurisdictions that are listed on the EU's blacklist from being awarded contracts as part of the public procurement process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[7247\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the appropriateness of companies using anonymous trustee ownership structures from being awarded contracts as part of the public procurement process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[7248\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the appropriateness of companies that use a bearer share ownership structure from being awarded contracts as part of the public procurement process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[7249\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the restrictions and appropriateness of companies that use transfer price transactions from being awarded contracts as part of the public procurement process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 to 252, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Public procurement in Ireland is governed by EU Procurement Directives and national legislation and guidance. Public bodies are obliged to act in accordance with these rules and accordingly must observe the general principles of EU law including non-discrimination, the free movement of goods and services, equal treatment, and proportionality and transparency in awarding public contracts. They must also ensure that procurement transactions and decisions are fair, equitable and deliver value for money.<\/p><p>Public procurement procedures require bidders to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts. The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude bidders from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 of 2016 - European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 on public procurement. The 2016 Regulations contain both compulsory and voluntary grounds for the exclusion of bidders.<\/p><p>The compulsory grounds for exclusion relate to certain serious offences which are deemed to preclude award of public contracts to a bidder - at least for a period of time. The compulsory exclusion grounds must be applied at all stages of a procurement procedure. These are:<\/p><p>- participation in a criminal organisation<\/p><p>- corruption<\/p><p>- fraud<\/p><p>- terrorist offences or offences linked to terrorist activities<\/p><p>- money laundering or terrorist financing<\/p><p>- child labour and human-trafficking related offences<\/p><p>- breach of tax or social security obligations.<\/p><p>Exclusions can only take place where the bidder or a person who is a member of its administrative, management, or supervisory body, or has powers of representation, decision, or control over it, has been convicted by a final judgment of one of the offences.  When invoking the grounds for exclusion, a contracting authority must have evidence of a sufficiently robust nature to withstand any challenge to that decision.  In the absence of a binding decision or final court judgment, the contracting authority may not be in a position to exclude a bidder.<\/p><p>Contracting authorities have discretion to disqualify bidders for competing in a public procurement competition for the following reasons:<\/p><p>- where the contracting authority can demonstrate violations of environmental, social and labour law obligations including rules on accessibility for disabled persons<\/p><p>- bankruptcy; insolvency or winding-up procedures; assets being administered by liquidator or by the Court;  arrangements with creditors<\/p><p>- where the contracting authority can demonstrate grave professional misconduct<\/p><p>- where a contracting authority has sufficiently plausible indications to conclude that bidders have entered into agreements with other tenderers aimed at distorting competition<\/p><p>- poor past performance where the candidate has shown significant or persistent deficiencies in a prior public contract which led to termination, damages or other comparable sanctions<\/p><p>- where a conflict of interest cannot be remedied by any less intrusive means<\/p><p>- where a distortion of competition arises from direct or indirect involvement in the preparation of the procurement procedure<\/p><p>- the bidder has been guilty of serious misinterpretation in supplying information required for the  verification of the absence of Exclusion Grounds or the fulfilment of the  Selection Criteria, has withheld such information or is not able to submit supporting documents in relation  to the ESPD (European Single Procurement Document)<\/p><p>- where the bidder has undertaken to unduly  influence the decision-making process of the contracting authority or  obtained confidential information which may confer upon it undue advantages in the procurement procedure or where the tenderer has  negligently provided misleading information that may have a  material  influence on decisions concerning exclusion, selection  or award<\/p><p>Where there is a conviction on compulsory exclusionary grounds, a bidder is excluded from competing for public contracts for a period of 5 years from the date of the relevant conviction.  Exclusion on the basis of voluntary exclusion grounds is for a period 3 years from the date of the relevant event.  A bidder has the opportunity to provide evidence at tender stage of &ldquo;self-cleaning&rdquo; measures and must not be excluded if such evidence is considered sufficient.  Such evidence could include, for example, payment of compensation in respect of any damage caused, active cooperation with investigating authorities by clarifying the facts and circumstances, implementation of technical, organisational or personnel measures that are appropriate to prevent further misconduct.  The self-cleansing option cannot, however, be extended in the case of exclusion from participation in procurement procedures because of a final court judgment.<\/p><p>Overall, when submitting a tender, bidders must consider whether any of the exclusion grounds listed in the procurement documents apply to them. Should any of the grounds apply, bidders must advise the contracting authority accordingly. The management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that bidders comply with all the requirements of the process. Contracting authorities may exclude bidders at any time during the procedures in accordance with the Regulations. In applying discretionary Exclusion Grounds, contracting authorities should pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality.<\/p><p>Exclusion of bidders on grounds other than those set out in the regulations is open to legal challenge by the excluded bidders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO04500"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[7282\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000071#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of efforts to address flooding on the River Inagh.","asker":"1519","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes and catchment drainage schemes designated under the Arterial Drainage Acts of 1945 and 1995.

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.  The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service.  <\/p>  <p>  The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation to which a number of stakeholders in the print sector have made submissions.  The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues.  I  look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work which will inform media policy, including print media,  over the next 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme referred to by the Deputy is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. There is no equivalent statutory scheme for the print sector and the BAI has no function in funding the print sector. As the Deputy will appreciate it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. <\/p>  <p>Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meeting key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  Work is continuing to explore the issues arising, with a follow up meeting between my officials and the NUJ taking place on 3rd February and a further meeting with Local Ireland has been scheduled for Wednesday 17th   February. In addition, the Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000072#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000072#WRP03500"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[7046\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000072#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) will be examined.","asker":"1514","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>An allocation of &euro;50 million was made in Budget 2021 for the live performance sector.

These Regulations classify \"statutory planning system activities, insofar as they cannot be carried out remotely\" as an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo;, as specified at paragraph 14, Part 2 of the Schedule to the Regulations concerning public administration, emergency services and defence. This enables the staff of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to travel to and from their offices as may be required for the performance of their statutory functions.

Other items that make up the all-in total include:<\/p><p>Design\/technical fees: Design fees vary from project to project, depending on the location, size and complexity of a scheme (and depending on whether design services are provided by a local authority in-house or via external appointment). As a guideline\/indicator, design fees are generally expected to range between 7.5% to 12.5% of construction costs. <\/p><p>Land cost: Land costs can vary significantly from project to project, depending on location and ownership status (e.g. varying from existing local authority land at no cost, to land purchased at market value).<\/p><p>Utilities: These include connection fees for Irish Water, ESB, Gas, etc. As a guideline\/indicator, utility connection costs are generally in the order of &euro;7,000 per unit.<\/p><p>Other Costs: Other items that can make up the 'all-in' delivery cost include site investigations\/surveys, archaeological requirements, 'Percent for Art' contributions, etc. and will vary from project to project.<\/p><p>Outlined as follows are the average costs of the social homes contracted by Donegal County Council through turnkey arrangements in each of the years 2016 and to end-February 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Average Cost Per Unit<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;153,705<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>&euro;192,687<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>&euro;167,218<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>In addition to the above costs, my Department also provides funding of up to 2% for the associated legal\/professional fees incurred by the local authority in relation to new social homes delivered via turnkey arrangements, as well as an administration fee, typically &euro;2,000 per unit.<\/p><p>I look forward to working with Donegal County Council in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the social housing stock by over 50,000 over the next five years.

It has been necessary to first prioritise issuing other Section 28 Guidelines, including with regard to apartment development further to review of co-living.  It has also been necessary, given the critical importance of housing, to develop and issue new Section 28 guidance on housing demand and supply, to ensure and consistent and integrated national approach to housing projections at local authority level, in advance of completing and issuing updated county development plan guidance.<\/p><p>In relation to housing demand and supply, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) published a report on <i>Regional Demographics and Structural Housing Demand at a County Level <\/i>in December 2020, that has been commissioned as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing research programme with the ESRI<i>. <\/i>The research provides a robust, up-to-date and independently developed housing demand projection, to inform policy and investment with regard to housing at national and local levels. <\/p><p>The ESRI projection model and paper are now the definitive source of information for Government, in the context of regular and often divergent estimates of housing demand from multiple sources. This research has been applied to underpin both the development plan and housing strategy processes at local authority level and forms the basis on which housing supply target requirements were issued to each local authority as Section 28 guidance, last December.<\/p><p>This comprises the &lsquo;Housing Supply Target Methodology for Development Planning, Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rsquo; under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) to provide a national methodology for each planning authority to estimate an overall housing supply target for their development plan, that is consistent with adopted national and regional growth targets in the National Planning Framework and Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies.<\/p><p>The housing supply target is quantified as an overall number of housing units to be planned for in the development plan process of each local authority. The guidelines issued provide a clear and consistent path for local authorities to progress county and city development plans, particularly in relation to future housing development.  My Department continues to actively engage with local authorities on the application of this methodology in relation to individual county\/city development plan processes.<\/p><p>National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework requires that each local authority should undertake a &quot;Housing Need and Demand Assessment&quot; (HNDA), to support the preparation of their statutory housing strategy and their development plan.  Work to support the development of the HNDA process is advancing and this work includes the development of a HNDA digital tool that has been piloted with a number of local authorities from November 2020 to date.  The outcome of the pilot phase is currently being reviewed in tandem with the update of key input data, and when finalised and rolled out nationally in the coming months, will be accompanied by a methodology in respect of the completion of a Housing Need and Demand Assessment.<\/p><p>It is important from a city and county development plan perspective that the housing demand and supply figures and methodology that were issued as Section 28 guidelines last December, share the same underlying statistical basis with the total housing demand and supply parameters to be used within the HNDA tool at local authority level.

This report was published by me on 7 September 2020. <\/p><p>I am in the process of  establishing a working group, to include representatives from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies, Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations and Industry Stakeholders under an independent chairperson, to examine the issues identified during the review, and, in particular:<\/p><p>- Reducing and ultimately eliminating the use of peat moss in the amateur gardening sector in order to leave what remains in use for the industry sector to buy time to develop alternatives, enabling food security and to provide industry surety.<\/p><p>- Graduating the elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry over an agreed period of years with an agreed end date. <\/p><p>- Finance and support for those workers whose skills cannot be accommodated in proposed alternative industries.<\/p><p>- Investment in further research into the development, education and use of alternatives to peat moss, such as bark, wood fibre, coir, biosolids, bracken and green compost, perlite, vermiculite, rockwool, and horticultural clay and in new methods of farming such as paludiculture and sphagnum farming.<\/p><p>- Up-skilling the existing workforce to regenerate the existing bogs for use in paludiculture, eco-tourism, carbon farming, and tree farming as appropriate to optimise environmental outcomes.<\/p><p>- Quantifying the value of the existing viable peat lands as carbon sinks and then determine a carbon market to incentivise owners and operators of peat lands to preserve, rewet or restore their assets. <\/p><p>- Educating the public to the benefits of what would be proposed to include the climate and environmental benefits, the economic, social, cultural and public health benefits.<\/p><p>I hope to be in a position to appoint a chairperson to the working group shortly. Thereafter, invitations to nominate representatives to the working group will issue from my Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000076#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":855,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000076#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":856,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[7087\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000076#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the purchase of property (details supplied) by foreign investors; the tax rate investors will pay on rental income; the impact these foreign investment firms' block purchases have on housing affordability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1574","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":857,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government, &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo;, commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system, which the Government has prioritised in Budget 2021 by providing for a suite of affordable housing measures totalling &euro;468 million.

In order for a household to qualify for HAP, they must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support by their local authority. Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP.<\/p><p>Under HAP, households at risk of homelessness may be eligible for additional supports.  To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.<\/p><p>Despite the challenges faced throughout 2020 due to the Covid emergency measures, local authorities and the Housing Assistance Payment Shared Service Centre (HAP SSC) have continued to provide a critical service to all HAP customers. This is evident in the high number of HAP tenancies that continued to be set-up. The 2020 HAP target was 15,750 additional tenancies and, at the end of Q3 2020, 11,887 HAP tenancies (76% of target) had been established.<\/p><p>Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19, however, have had an impact on processing times for HAP applications, including Homeless HAP Applications. The average processing time at end Q2, 2020 was 40 days.  An analysis of more recent data from the HAP SSC indicates a reduction on that average processing time at end Q3, 2020 to 38 days.<\/p><p>The HAP application form comes in two parts, Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. <\/p><p>Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP Shared Service Centre. HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord may be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.<\/p><p>Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities. The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.<\/p><p>The average processing time of a HAP application, including Homeless HAP applications, is provided in the following table: <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>Average for the Quarter <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Q4 2018<\/td>       <td>27 days<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Q4 2019<\/td>       <td>34 days<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Q3 2020 *<\/td>       <td>38 days<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Q4 2020 HAP data is not available at this time.<\/p><p>Through our ongoing engagement with local authorities my Department has stressed the need to minimise delays in processing these vital applications to ensure the social housing needs of tenants can be met through the HAP scheme where required.

The conflict has had a devastating impact on the population of Tigray, and poses severe risks to the stability of the wider Horn of Africa region. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is engaging directly as well as actively supporting the efforts of the EU, UN and wider international community to address the crisis, including through engagement with the African Union. We are strongly supportive of regional efforts to try to find a resolution to the conflict. However progress has been limited to date.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland raised the situation in Ethiopia at the UN Security Council on 3 February, expressing deep concern at the humanitarian situation in Tigray and calling for unhindered humanitarian access. Ireland also called on all parties in Tigray to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law including those related to the protection of civilians and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence. Ireland will continue to advocate for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  In contacts with key interlocutors, Minister Coveney has called on all parties to cease hostilities, respect international humanitarian law and begin dialogue, as well as for immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to affected areas. He has condemned reported atrocities and identity-based attacks, and has called for the human rights of all Ethiopians to be upheld.  Ireland continues to engage with regional actors in this regard, including in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Pretoria, and through our membership of the European Union. <\/p>  <p>  Last week, and following discussion of the situation in Ethiopia at the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 January, Minister Coveney raised the situation in Tigray with his counterparts in Germany, in the context of contacts between Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and Finland, in advance of the visit to the region by its Foreign Minister on behalf of the EU. Ireland will continue to work closely with our EU partners to ensure a strong response to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis.

The EDP builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps operate a fleet of fixed and rotary wing aircraft which provide military support to the Army and Naval Service, together with support for non-military air services such as Garda air support, air ambulance, fisheries protection and the Ministerial Air Transport Service.<\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps two (2) EC135 P2 helicopters entered service in 2005 and will continue, along the fleet of six (6) AW139 helicopters, to deliver the required Defence Forces support and other support capabilities.  It is not easy to generalise as to the lifespan of aircraft as this is a function of usage, frequency of landings, the maintenance regime adopted, safety factors and changes in and availability of technological updates which can all bear on the availability and cost effectiveness of maintaining an aircraft in service.  Subject to these factors, the average lifespan of most military aircraft would be expected to be 30 years, although there are cases where this period is shorter and indeed, much longer.  All equipment priorities are kept under continuous review and there are no plans to replace helicopters at this time. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, a step change in military air-based capability is being achieved, however, through the delivery into service of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.  While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the previous level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.  The PC-12 has proven itself an effective and versatile asset.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  Investment under the National Development Plan (NDP) continues to increase.  Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross NDP allocation to &euro;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000078#WRV02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Data","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000078#WRV03000"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[6610\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000078#WRV03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of civilian or military pharmacists working in the Defence Forces in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>My Department currently employs one civilian pharmacist, together with two military pharmacists serving in the Defence Forces.

Where schools are experiencing broadband difficulties with their current schools broadband connecting, in the first instance schools should make contact with the Broadband Service desk team at broadbandservicedesk@pdst.ie or by phoning 1800334466 in order to identify any potential  issue and also to record their bandwidth upgrade request.<\/p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and within financial constraints. Currently investment of some &euro;13m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools. As you are no doubt aware, broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools.

However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. <\/p>  <p>   It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I have powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort and where all reasonable efforts have failed. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, having considered a report submitted by the NCSE which identified a need for special education placements in South Dublin, the then Minister served statutory notices under Section 37A on 39 schools in the area.<\/p>  <p>  This legal process is still underway and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.

This is important in the context of addressing the need for additional post-primary school places in Drogheda and Laytown School planning areas for the next 3 years including September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  While the school was originally announced as a new 600 pupil regional solution for the Laytown &amp;amp; Drogheda school planning areas, it was indicated at the time that new school sizes would be responsive to patronage or demographic demand.  Projections at the time indicated likely additional school place requirements and, following a patronage competition, Drogheda ETSS was established as a new 600 pupil (expandable to 1,000 pupil) school.  Refreshed demographic data indicates that demand in both of these school planning areas supports the school growing to 1,000 pupil.<\/p>  <p>  The level of interim accommodation to be provided on the St. Olivers Community School site will be in excess of 6,800m&sup2; and will consist of 13 general classrooms, 14 specialist rooms, 2 special classes, pastoral rooms and other ancillary accommodation. Providing enhanced facilities for Drogheda ETSS and the capacity to cater for increased enrolments over the next 3 years, including for September 2021, are particularly important aspects of the project.<\/p>  <p>  The existing temporary Drogheda ETSS site is too small to facilitate the proposed accommodation and St. Olivers Community College site is the only LMETB owned site in the vicinity that has capacity. The school will remain on the ETB-owned site until its new permanent school building is provided. LMETB has agreed to deliver the project and a planning application will be submitted as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to a permanent site for Drogheda ETSS, the Department has undertaken and continues to undertake a site identification process in respect of suitable sites in the South Drogheda area. To date it has proven challenging to identify suitable available sites in the area. Currently, the Department is undertaking an assessment of two potential sites.   Due to commercial sensitivities it is not possible to provide further information at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Department envisages that the new permanent school will be provided under a Design &amp;amp; Build contract and has procurement frameworks in place to deliver this as quickly as possible.  A typical construction period for a 1,000 pupil school is 18 months.  However, the identification and acquisition of a permanent site and the associated design and planning permission processes are key first steps in facilitating construction of the new permanent school building.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.

Chosen learning tasks provide an opportunity to demonstrate a student&rsquo;s learning in a clear and concise way. These learning tasks enable teachers to monitor progress and provide constructive, developmental feedback to support learning.<\/p>  <p>  Where possible it is important that pupils move on with their peers and continue on to the next stage of their education. When pupils have started back in school, the principal and teachers can assess their needs and adapt their teaching programme so that any gaps in their learning resulting from the temporary closure of schools can be addressed. For the vast majority of pupils, this will ensure progression is as seamless a manner as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances a school may conclude a pupil or student would benefit educationally by repeating a grade level having first consulted with the learning support teacher\/resource teacher and class teacher and parents. In such circumstances there should be a clear programme outlined for such a pupil that records precisely what new approach will be used for her\/him and what its expected benefit will be. These records should be retained within the school and should be brought to the attention of a Department Inspectorate, by the Principal on visiting the school.<\/p>  <p>  The full re-opening of our schools for all students remains a top priority for Government and I am committed to working on an ongoing basis with all stakeholders to achieve this outcome at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000081#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":1109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000081#WRY00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1110,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[6739\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000081#WRY00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans for the school inclusion model plan (details supplied); if the model will be continued on a pilot basis; if so, when will the findings of the pilot scheme be released; if a decision has been made on whether the model will be rolled-out nationally; if so, the date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Discussions on Junior Cycle examinations will continue in these engagements.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has indicated to the education partners that any corresponding process would need to include the following features:<\/p>  <p>  - The State Examinations Commission running both the examinations and the corresponding process;<\/p>  <p>  - Better provision for out-of-school learners in the corresponding process;<\/p>  <p>  - Some cognisance of performance in &ldquo;additional component&rdquo; elements of examinations (coursework, orals, practicals, etc.); and<\/p>  <p>  - Timely progression to higher and further education using either examinations or the outcome of any corresponding process.<\/p>  <p>  All partners are committed to acting in the interests and wellbeing of students, who are at the heart of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000081#WRY04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000081#WRY04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1150,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[6938\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000081#WRY05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the case of a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1151,"content":"<p>I would like to inform the Deputy that the school in question should contact their Insurance Provider in the first instance to ascertain what damages are covered under their Policy.

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  <\/p>  <p>  NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. <\/p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  16 special classes provide ASD and ASD Early Intervention placements for students in Dublin 9 and 11 at Primary and Post Primary level. The admission policies of schools are the remit of the Board of Management of each school and, as such, the NCSE has no role in relation to the number of applicants or waiting lists. Once schools notify NCSE of vacancies within their specialist provision, SENOs work locally to ensure parents are made aware of these special class places. <\/p>  <p>  Through ongoing consultation at local level the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021\/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. <\/p>  <p>  Special classes in the Dublin area generally operate at capacity, and the NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in the county to encourage and support the opening of new ASD classes at all levels. The NCSE has specific plans in place to open a number of additional classes in schools in North Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Information on the list of schools with special classes together with SENO contact details is available at www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1159,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[6978\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the school transport review; if the terms of reference have been finalised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1160,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

All of those meetings were focused on the safe reopening of schools. Recently, the engagements were particularly focused on the more specific question of a limited reopening of in-school provision for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Following intensive engagement and input from primary and special education partners, a framework has now been developed and agreed with all partners, including unions and management, in order to achieve a phased return to in-school provision for children with the most complex special educational needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the framework the following phased return to in-school provision has been agreed: <\/p>  <p>  Phase 1: Special schools will reopen from Thursday 11th February 2021. In accordance with this agreement pupils will attend on a 50 per cent basis to allow for attendance of reduced numbers within the school setting.

Registration ensures that standards of entry to the profession are maintained. Teachers may apply for registration in the primary, post-primary, further education and other sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The registration of teachers is governed by Section 31 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 and the Council registers teachers under the Teaching Council Registration Regulations 2016. My Department is not directly involved in the registration of individual teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants wishing to register as a teacher in the Further Education sector must meet the requirements for registration under Route 3, as set out in the regulations, which are available on the Teaching Council&rsquo;s website at www.teachingcouncil.ie\/en\/Registration\/How-do-I-register-\/.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise members of the Council of Irish Sign Language Teachers (CISLT) to liaise directly with the Teaching Council regarding their registration.<\/p>  <p>  Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf\/hard of hearing, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. <\/p>  <p>  The total education spend on special education is about &euro;2 Billion - almost a fifth - of the the annual educational and training budget. This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.<\/p>  <p>  Included in this provision is an extensive range of supports to assist students who are deaf or hard of hearing. In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and\/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.<\/p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children\/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. <\/p>  <p>  The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible, offering telephone advice, a school visit from a member of the team, an in-service course for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the pupils&rsquo; educational needs, as they progress through primary and post primary school.<\/p>  <p>  Among the courses towards which funding is provided to schools are courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.<\/p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils, and enhanced levels of capitation in special classes and special schools.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings, parents\/guardians and grandparents. <\/p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, including students who are deaf\/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme in May 2018. The report recommends that Irish Sign Language (ISL) qualified assistants should be put in place to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017..<\/p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of this review and the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, a scheme will be developed to provide Irish Sign Language support for students attending recognised schools, whose primary language is Irish Sign Language. It will take some time to introduce and implement this ISL scheme. In the interim these posts are filled, on a case by case basis, through the NCSE to allocate an additional SNA post with appropriate ISL qualifications. They are employed on similar terms and conditions to SNAs. The purpose of these posts is to enable these students attend school and access the curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  A new undergraduate programme, Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language), in Dublin City University (DCU), launched in 2019, enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.<\/p>  <p>  Previously, there was no entry route to primary teacher education for someone who communicates through ISL and could not meet the minimum entry requirement for Irish in Leaving Certificate. This B.Ed. allows ISL to be accepted as an alternative to Irish. It is an important step towards ensuring increased access and inclusion for all in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that, when qualified, these students will teach in schools for the deaf or special classes in mainstream schools. These qualified teachers will have a high level of ability in ISL, in-depth knowledge of bilingual education and the ability to teach all of the curriculum subjects through ISL. It will further aid deaf children who use Irish Sign Language in primary school to fully access the curriculum by having teachers who are fluent ISL users. <\/p>  <p>  This new Bachelor of Education (ISL) is approved by the Department of Education and accredited by the Teaching Council.<\/p>  <p>  The duties of the Minister for Education in relation to the implementation of the ISL Act are set out in Section 5 of the Act and the Minister has no role in recognising representative bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 10(3) of the Act, the Minister for Justice shall ensure that persons or organisations that are representative of the interests of the members of the deaf community are consulted on the matters to be considered in a report prepared on the operation of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Following the transfer of disability policy functions from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY), DCEDIY have responsibility for the ISL Act. The question regarding the recognition of the CISLT as a representative body in relation to the ISL Act is more appropriate to my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1202,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[7207\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of providing a new school building for a school (details supplied) in County Mayo; the stage of approval the project is at; the remaining stages to be completed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1203,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a building project for the school in question is included in my Department's school building programme to be delivered as part of the National Development Plan (NDP). <\/p><p>Detailed consideration is being given to the accommodation needs of this school and how to best meet them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000082#WRZ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":1205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000083#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1206,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[7231\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000083#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she has identified a suitable property to locate a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1207,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to providing permanent accommodation to meet the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers.<\/p><p>In this regard, officials in my Department are in active engagement with officials from Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council to further appraise two potential site options in terms of technical suitability.

This Report was developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  For the purpose of this review and for future work in primary and post-primary curriculum developments, the NCCA describes RSE as a curriculum-based process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical and social aspects of relationships and sexuality. It aims to equip children and young people with knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that will empower them to develop self-awareness and self-esteem, realise their health, wellbeing and dignity; develop positive and respectful social and sexual relationships; consider how their choices affect their own wellbeing and that of others; and, understand their rights and responsibilities in relation to themselves and others.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA were asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; developments in relation to contraception; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. These include primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE\/RSE commenced in the NCCA earlier this year, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work includes engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work as originally planned, due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, the NCCA began convening online meetings with these groups as of October 2020 which allows them to review significant work that has been progressed. Both the primary and post primary SPHE\/RSE development groups have been meeting successfully via Zoom on a monthly basis since the groups were convened in October last.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and the first section of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycle Short Course and Senior Cycle SPHE Framework) is now published. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum has begun, with an initial focus on Junior Cycle. To support this work NCCA are inviting teachers and students to give feedback on their experience of the Junior Cycle SPHE short course specifically.  The feedback from students, teachers, and the support services working with them will inform the work of the post primary development group in updating the Junior Cycle SPHE short course. A draft, updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification is due to be available for public consultation by the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Further recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being considered by my Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000083#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000083#WRAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[7326\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000083#WRAA02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports and resources in place for parents of children with dyslexia.","asker":"1566","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1231,"content":"<p>The Department provides for a range of supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, she will have access to an appropriate education. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is a separate statutory agency, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for the provision of special educational needs supports to schools.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support.<\/p><p>All primary and post primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia.  In September 2017 the Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools and all schools received revised special education teacher allocations for the 2019\/20 school year. <\/p><p>The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.  This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website, at www.education.ie\/en\/The-Education-System\/Special-Education\/Guidelines-for-Primary-Schools-Supporting-Pupils-with-Special-Educational-Needs-in-Mainstream-Schools.pdf  Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.  <\/p><p>Funding is available to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs. In order to qualify for equipment under the scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.  It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.  Equipment may only be provided where medical and\/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this.  An assessment indicating that equipment would achieve improvement in performance is not sufficient since this could be true in the case of any child.<\/p><p>Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010\/2013.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at .<\/p><p>Resources provided to schools also include additional training for teachers who support children with special educational needs, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  <\/p><p>The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is part of the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, along with the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf\/hard of hearing and for children who are blind\/visually impaired (VTSVHI). <\/p><p>The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs.

The filling of vacancies will be prioritized.  . <\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to T&uacute;s and recognise the work undertaken by T&uacute;s projects in the delivery of valuable services to local communities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000084#WRBB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1281,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000084#WRBB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1282,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[6492\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000084#WRBB02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an increased pandemic unemployment payment system will be considered for wedding industry specialists to help support ongoing expenses and costs.","asker":"1519","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1283,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[6814\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000084#WRBB02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the pandemic unemployment payment will be extended beyond March 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[6906\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000084#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on extending the pandemic unemployment  payment scheme beyond 31 March 2021 due to the ongoing economic effects of the pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1285,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491, 503 and 505 together.<\/p><p>The Government will continue to keep all aspects of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) under review and future decisions will be informed by the trajectory of the pandemic and the evolving public health situation.<\/p><p>Government intervention through the introduction of the PUP and other targeted supports has provided key financial assistance to employees and businesses who have been impacted by Covid-19.

These included the finalisation of the general arrears project involving 286,000 additional payments on 1 December, payment of the Christmas Bonus on 8 December to just over 283,000 recipients of the PUP, and advance payments over the Christmas period. My Department has also been focused on responding to the increased numbers of people applying for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, with an increase of over 200,000 claims in payment since the start of this year.

This specific module was created alongside the inquisitorial process to facilitate those with lived experiences of these institutions to provide accounts of their experiences in complete confidence and as informally as possible in the circumstances. <\/p><p>The Commission's terms of reference required the Confidential Committee to provide for individuals who wish to have their identity remain confidential.  The Commission is independent in the conduct of its inquiries and I had no role in or knowledge of operational decisions taken by the Commission in the course of its work.  In its Final Report, the Commission notes that &ldquo;<i>Witnesses were asked for permission to record their evidence on the clear understanding that the recordings would be used only as an aide memoire for the researcher when compiling the report and would then be destroyed.  All such recordings were destroyed after the report was added to the Confidential Committee electronic repository of information.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Therefore, the decision not to retain these recordings was taken by the Commission to ensure the anonymity it had promised. My Department's understanding is that recordings were made as an aid to the work of the Confidential Committee and that the above reference includes contemporaneous notes taken by the note taker at the same time and used to create the records retained for the Confidential Committee. <\/p><p>In October 2020, Government introduced urgent legislation to protect and preserve the Commission&rsquo;s records. This legislation prevented the redaction of personal information so that the records can be made available to those seeking access to their personal information.  <\/p><p>The only exception to the above requirement was to facilitate persons who voluntarily met the Confidential Committee to decide to have their name and contact details redacted so as to protect their anonymity.  This provision reflects the promise of confidentiality and anonymity which was given by the Commission to people who attended the Confidential Committee.  No such anonymity applies to the sworn testimony given before the Commission itself.  <\/p><p>Many of the mothers and children have undoubtedly had difficult experiences where their agency was taken away and it would be unconscionable to renege on a commitment of confidentiality given to them.  <\/p><p>The Commission is due to deposit its full archive with my Department prior to its dissolution at the end of the month. In the interim, the independent Commission continues to be the data controller for its records. <\/p><p>Intensive preparations are ongoing to ensure subject access requests can be processed in my Department in full compliance with the Data Protection Regulatory Framework.  In the context of these preparations, I have has sought further information from the Chair of the Commission to clarify whether it may be technically possible to recover any recordings or notes made by the Confidential Committee.  <\/p><p>In addition, I am liaising closely with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure these matters can be appropriately addressed by the Commission prior to its dissolution. <\/p><p>A decision on any further action will be informed by this information gathering exercise and the legal advices of the Attorney General. Any call to extend the timeframe of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes must have regard to the fact that the Commission completed the inquiries it was established to conduct when submitting its Final Report last year. It is not clear at this point that an extension is in fact necessary to clarify these matters, or that extending the timeframe of the Commission would assist in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000086#WRDD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1412,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000086#WRDD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1413,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[6334\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000086#WRDD04500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the protocols and process in place in respect of the administration of vaccinations with particular reference to  MMR and Hepatitis B vaccines in direct provision centres throughout the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1589","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1414,"content":"<p>The provision of health services to international protection applicants is mainstreamed in Ireland.

This new funding arrangement ensures that childcare services can remain open where they have demand for places for the children of essential workers and vulnerable children. <\/p>  <p>  The package of measures introduced is designed to ensure that the significant public money which is being invested in services at this time is structured in a fair and balanced way.<\/p>  <p>  Although the ECCE programme has been suspended, at least 70% of ECCE funding can continue to be claimed by all services, whether open or closed and NCS, CCSP, TEC and AIM Level 7 funding schemes continue to be payable at full rates. <\/p>  <p>  Closed services, in return for this funding, will be asked to commit to waiving parental fees, retaining staff where possible, keeping places for children and undertaking remote engagement with children. <\/p>  <p>  For open services, the remaining 30% of the value of the ECCE funding will also be made up, subject to services providing the same assurances mentioned above to the Department.  Most services are doing this already and I warmly welcome this.<\/p>  <p>  Central to this package is the enhanced employment wage subsidy scheme, which providers continue to be eligible to access with an exemption in place in respect of the turnover requirement.  All providers are encouraged to avail of this scheme which significantly contributes to payroll costs, covering at least 80% of average wage costs in most instances. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that for some providers who are particularly reliant on parental fee income, the requirement to waive fees for families not using their service at this time presents difficulties.  In these circumstances, a newly designed Covid-19 operating support payment (COSP) is being put in place that will support these providers to parental waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Many childcare services refunded fees to parents whose children did not attend childcare in January and this new COSP funding package will support childcare services that choose to refund fees from 1 February to 5 March.<\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for the COSP is determined on the basis of transparent, objective criteria, to support ease of administration for a scheme that is expected to operate for a short period of time. The criteria have been selected on the basis that services most reliant on parental fees will be identified. <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some services that are reliant on parental fees may not meet the criteria &ndash; it is open to such services to apply for the Covid-19 sustainability fund if the service has sustainability concerns as a result of the current restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  This sustainability funding will be in addition to the existing financial supports for services, including the EWSS and the COSP. Where a service has sustainability concerns as a result of the current restrictions, additional supports may be made available under the Covid-19 sustainability fund to ensure services can continue to operate. Further details on this fund will be issued shortly. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, services with concerns are encouraged to get in touch with their local City\/County Childcare Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000088#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1489,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000088#WRFF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1490,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[7093\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000088#WRFF00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the efforts being made by his Department to improve the pay and working conditions of workers in the early-years sector, as outlined in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1491,"content":"<p>I am very conscious need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in early learning and care and school-age childcare services.

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely. <\/p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:<\/p>  <p>  - teaching and learning, <\/p>  <p>  - assessment, and <\/p>  <p>  - qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers at a local and regional level. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. <\/p>  <p>  While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements. It is in this context that I have asked QQI, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue. The focus of these engagements will be to identify solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. These engagements will facilitate a dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care. <\/p>  <p>  Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000088#WRFF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":1526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000089#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1527,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[6485\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000089#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the implementation of the Cassells report; the number of potential funding options including the deferred payment of student fees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1528,"content":"<p>In response to the combined demographic and funding challenge, the then Minister for Education and Skills appointed an Expert Group to identify and consider issues related to the long term sustainable funding of higher education in Ireland and to identify funding options for the future.<\/p><p>The expert group report, Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education&rdquo; (2016) confirmed that higher education makes a hugely positive contribution to the development of individuals, employers, society and the state.<\/p><p>The report concluded that the approach to funding was unsustainable, and that substantial increases in investment in higher education must be made to ensure that the sector can remain viable and provide the capacity to meet the major increase in student demand projected up to 2030.<\/p><p>The expert group report has opened up an important debate in Ireland on how our third level education system could be funded.<\/p><p>The report proposed three main funding options for a more sustainable future funding model.

These range from remote or online learning to one day per week in an education institution or, in the case of craft apprenticeships, in periods of 10-35 week placements in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) or Institutes of Technology\/Technological Universities. Many academic and vocational courses in the further and higher education and training sector also incorporate work placements, however these learners are not employees for the full duration of their course.<\/p>  <p>  Waiting time for electrical and certain other craft apprenticeships are linked to physical capacity in ETB Training Centres and Institutes of Technology\/Technological Universities.  Pre COVID-19 the rapid rate of recovery of craft apprentice registrations due to the recovery of the construction sector was placing the existing off-the-job training facilities under stress.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2020, all face to face off-the-job training for craft apprenticeship programmes was suspended.  The closure of the education and training sector to face to face delivery of training between March and September 2020 resulted in the immediate loss of approximately 2,200 training places on phase 4 &amp;amp; 6 craft apprenticeships (April intake) and in the region of 2,000 phase 2 training places over the period of the closure. In addition to the immediate loss of places, the return to face to face training in September was subject to strict Covid-19 measures which has resulted in the reduction of available places.  <\/p>  <p>  Other apprenticeships in areas which were amenable to remote delivery moved fully online or were modified to allow for greater flexibility between on-the-job and off-the-job elements of the programmes. Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver this flexibility in programme provision or assessment in the practical elements of craft apprenticeships (Phases 2, 4 and 6) due to the need to access workshops and equipment together. This, with the simultaneous closure of the construction sector, meant that apprentices&rsquo; progress through their programme was delayed.  <\/p>  <p>  The following measures have been taken to ameliorate the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 measures on craft apprentices and to move to reduce waiting times for off-the-job training for certain craft apprenticeships:-<\/p>  <p>  - An alternative assessment approach was delivered for the theory assessments for up to 2,500 craft apprentices who had been close to finishing their phase of training at the time of the shutdown in March.  Outstanding practical assessments were prioritised for completion in September 2020, with over 1,000 apprentices completing practical assessments and their phase of training.<\/p>  <p>  - Craft apprentices who had had their off-the-job training interrupted in March 2020 were prioritised for a return to training from 31 August (ETB training centres) and from 10      September (Institutes of Technology and TU Dublin).<\/p>  <p>  - Additional trainer posts have been sanctioned on a temporary basis where ETBs have identified a need for additional staff to deliver off-the-job training within Covid-19 guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;12m has been provided in Budget 2021 to support additional places which will mitigate against the effect of smaller apprenticeship class sizes and catch up on lost provision in spring and summer 2020.<\/p>  <p>  - SOLAS and the HEA have issued calls for  proposals to all craft apprenticeship training providers to identify additional capacity that could be developed for apprenticeship training. <\/p>  <p>  - The HEA and SOLAS are also engaging further in relation to the curricula to see what parts can be delivered online and are working with the sector to see which elements of craft apprenticeship might be amenable to blended learning.<\/p>  <p>Following the 6th January 2021 Government advice to minimise movement, off-the-job training for craft apprentices moved to primarily online delivery. This approach is now continuing into February due to the extension of the Level 5 pandemic restrictions until the 5th March.  There will be a focus on theory-based elements of the curriculum during this period, and teaching and learning supports will be provided by Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and the Technological Universities.<\/p>  <p>Apprentices due to begin off-the-job training during February and March will commence their training online.

This ranges from remote or online learning to one day per week in an education institution or, in the case of craft apprenticeships, in periods of 10-35 week placements in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) or Institutes of Technology\/Technological Universities. Many academic and vocational courses in the further and higher education and training sector also incorporate work placements, however these learners are not employees for the full duration of their course.<\/p><p>Waiting times for electrical and certain other craft apprenticeships are linked to physical capacity in ETB Training Centres and Institutes of Technology\/Technological Universities.  Pre COVID-19 the rapid rate of recovery of craft apprentice registrations due to the recovery of the construction sector was placing the existing off-the-job training facilities under stress.<\/p><p>In March 2020, all face to face off-the-job training for craft apprenticeship programmes was suspended.  The closure of the education and training sector to face to face delivery of training between March and September 2020 resulted in the immediate loss of approximately 2,200 training places on phase 4 &amp;amp; 6 craft apprenticeships (April intake) and in the region of 2,000 phase 2 training places over the period of the closure. In addition to the immediate loss of places, the return to face to face training in September was subject to strict Covid-19 measures which has resulted in the reduction of available places.  <\/p><p>Other apprenticeships in areas which were amenable to remote delivery moved fully online or were modified to allow for greater flexibility between on-the-job and off-the-job elements of the programmes. Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver this flexibility in programme provision or assessment in the practical elements of craft apprenticeships (Phases 2, 4 and 6) due to the need to access workshops and equipment together. This, with the simultaneous closure of the construction sector, meant that apprentices&rsquo; progress through their programme was delayed.  <\/p><p>The following measures have been taken to ameliorate the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 measures on craft apprentices and to move to reduce waiting times for off-the-job training for certain craft apprenticeships:-<\/p><p>- An alternative assessment approach was delivered for the theory assessments for up to 2,500 craft apprentices who had been close to finishing their phase of training at the time of the shutdown in March.  Outstanding practical assessments were prioritised for completion in September 2020, with over 1,000 apprentices completing practical assessments and their phase of training.<\/p><p>- Craft apprentices who had had their off-the-job  training interrupted in March 2020 were prioritised for a return to training from 31 August (ETB training centres) and from 10 September (Institutes of Technology and TU Dublin).<\/p><p>- Additional trainer posts have been sanctioned on a temporary basis where ETBs have identified a need for additional staff to deliver off-the-job training within Covid-19 guidelines.<\/p><p>- &euro;12m has been provided in Budget 2021 to support additional places which will mitigate against the effect of smaller apprenticeship class sizes and catch up on lost provision in spring and summer 2020.<\/p><p>- SOLAS and the HEA have issued calls for proposals  to all craft apprenticeship training providers to identify additional  capacity that could be developed for apprenticeship training.<\/p><p>- The HEA and SOLAS are also  engaging further in relation to the curricula to see what parts can be delivered online and are working with the sector to see which elements of craft apprenticeship might be amenable to blended learning.<\/p><p>Following the 6 January 2021 Government advice to minimise movement, off-the-job training for craft apprentices moved to primarily online delivery. This approach is now continuing into February due to the extension of the Level 5 pandemic restrictions until the 5<sup>th<\/sup>March.  There will be a focus on theory-based elements of the curriculum during this period, and teaching and learning supports will be provided by Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and the Technological Universities.<\/p><p>Apprentices due to begin off-the-job training during February and March will commence their training online.

The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. <\/p>  <p>  Any student who believes their student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.<\/p>  <p>The statutory based Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations are reviewed annually by my Department, following consultation with various stakeholders. It is anticipated that the Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2021\/22 academic year will be published in early April 2021.

The relevant bodies include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners, the Chief State Solicitors Office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts.  It should be noted that in some cases, funds seized represent overdue or unpaid personal taxation.<\/p><p>I understand that, in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended, and SI No. 418\/2011, all confiscations relating to the proceeds of crime are transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to be paid into the Exchequer.  It is from this central fund that the Government draws expenditure on all necessary public services and investment including for communities affected by crime.<\/p><p>I am informed that the disparity between what is seized in a given year and that which is returned to the Exchequer can be explained by reference to three primary considerations: <\/p><p>1.  Firstly, section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, under which the Criminal Assets Bureau vests seized assets in the Exchequer, cannot be invoked until the expiration of a seven year period from the date of seizure.  Thus, if property is seized by CAB in 2020, under ordinary circumstances, that property cannot vest in the Exchequer until 2027.  This seven year time period is set out in the section 4 of the PoCA, and can only be dispensed with on the consent of the Respondent.  <\/p><p>2.  Secondly, for a variety of reasons e.g. depreciation, notoriety associated with asset, condition etc. the values attributed to assets at seizure may not be the value realised by the sale of those assets.  <\/p><p>3.  Thirdly, receivership costs including the cost of securing, managing, storing, valuing and selling an asset will need to be deducted from the gross sales value to ascertain the amount returned to the Exchequer.  <\/p><p>In addition to the above, on some occasions assets which the Criminal Assets Bureau have seized and obtained an order over, following an application to the High Court, can be returned to a third party, i.e. an injured party.  A case in point is the Abacha case where the Bureau returned funds in 2020 to the Nigerian Government and not the Exchequer.<\/p><p>The activities of the Bureau are reported on each year in its Annual Report and can be found at <i>www.cab.ie<\/i>.

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. <\/p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually inaccordance with legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant. All applicants are required to meet minimumperiods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic, I have provided six extensions of immigration permission to 20 April 2021, to ensure that those requiring an immigration permission to work in the state could continue to do so including those providing frontline services. <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to recently announce  that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4000 qualifying applicants will be asked to complete a statutory declaration that will be sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March and I am pleased to say that more than 500 certificates have already issued this week. A significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers who have made extraordinary contributions during the pandemic will also benefit from these new arrangements over the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000091#WRJJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":1656,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000091#WRJJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1657,"qnumday":622,"qnumall":"[6634\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000091#WRJJ02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 680 of 13 January 2021, if the email address for queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases referred to in the response will be provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1658,"content":"<p>There are a number of avenues available to public representatives to raise matters with me or directly with officials of my department in respect of individual immigration queries.

Being unable to speak publicly about how they want their children to be remembered is wrong and I have committed to changing that. <\/p>  <p>  I brought proposals to Cabinet this week to resolve this issue.  I have secured Government approval to support a Bill in the Seanad presented by Senator Michael McDowell, subject to acceptance of the necessary Government amendments. The Bill is scheduled for second stage in the Seanad next week.  Government time will be made available for committee stage in the coming weeks at which point the relevant Government amendments will be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that all parties, across the D&aacute;il and Seanad, co-operate in passing the necessary amendment to change Section 252 of the Children Act as quickly as possible in order to give grieving parents back the power to speak publically about their children. I am confident that with the cooperation of the members in both Houses we can have this legislation enacted before the end of March.<\/p>  <p>  Of course any changes to the Children Act will have to be carefully considered to ensure they are consistent with the key principle of the best interests of the child. This is important as the section to be amended was designed to protect child witnesses as well as victims in the criminal justice process.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that issues have also arisen on foot of the ruling regarding cases with respect to persons who were children at the time of the offence but adults when the proceedings were taken against the perpetrators. I am also working to address the effect of the ruling  in the context of the legislative amendments that might be required to address this particular matter.<\/p>  <p>  While I am determined to progress these changes as quickly as possible, it is important that in taking forward any legislative amendments, full consideration is given to all potential issues in order to avoid any unintended consequences the changes might give rise to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000091#WRJJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":1674,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000091#WRJJ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1675,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[6757\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000091#WRJJ03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide details of the procedure to be followed to update stamp residency status in the case of a person (details supplied) who is unable to update a passport due to Covid-19 pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1676,"content":"<p>An application for a renewal of an Atypical Working Scheme visa on behalf of the person referred to by the Deputy was received by my department on 12 June 2020.

It is also the case that prisoners will not always declare their affiliation to certain groupings and it is therefore not possible to provide definitive numbers in relation to the number of known members of criminal groupings currently in custody. It should also be noted that more than one criminal gang may group together under the umbrella of a particular group and in some instances some gangs may form splinter groups due to family or in house disputes.<\/p>  <p>  A suite of assessment and intervention pathways are available to violent offenders in prison to address dynamic risk factors known to be associated with violent offending, in order to reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection. This includes offence focused and\/or mental health intervention by the IPS Psychology Service and\/or Probation Service on an individual or group basis. All violent offenders with a sentence of over 2 years on committal are pro-actively targeted to assess and\/or identify the clinical needs\/risk factors that led to their offending. This includes those convicted of a gangland violence. In addition specialist programmes, including a gang desistance group, are currently being developed, which incorporates collaboration with men with a history of gang involvement in the development and facilitation of the programme. <\/p>  <p>  A full range of policies, procedures and standard operating procedures are used by the IPS to identify, monitor and manage specific individuals.

Programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to engage with the services.<\/p><p>On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.

Currently, prison psychologists are engaging with between 620 - 650 people in custody which includes assessment and-or intervention which can be either group or individual rehabilitative programmes. <\/p><p>Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education Training Boards and the IPS in line with the joint Strategy 2019 - 2021 which sets out a commitment to the provision of a broad and flexible curriculum and includes supporting integration and sentence planning.<\/p><p>The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  Data on the average weekly attendances in Prison Education Centres in 2020 is set out in Table 1 below. It is important to note that Education Centres were closed due to Covid-19 from March 2020 to August 2020.<\/p><p>The guiding principles of vocational training services are to make, work, work-training and other purposeful activities available to all those in custody.  Training activities are designed to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release. The average prison population engaged in vocational training in 2020 per prison is set out in Table 2.<\/p><p>The IPS has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies along with the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the prison service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification to people in custody. Unfortunately, the manner in which records are collated does not allow the provision of statistics on those who were successful or unsuccessful applicants for such training. <table>    <tr>

657 and 658 together.<\/p><p>Prisoner care and rehabilitation is a core aim of the Irish Prison Service.  The Service tries to achieve a balanced approach in the effective performance of its care and custody functions and seeks to manage sentences in a way which encourages and supports prisoners in their efforts to live law abiding and purposeful lives on release.<\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that various forms of rehabilitative training within the prison system continues to be made available to all prisoners, including first time offenders. <\/p><p>There is a wide range of rehabilitative programmes available in all prisons and to all prisoners. These include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, addiction counselling, welfare and spiritual services and are provided with the aim of offering  purposeful activity to all those in custody while serving their sentences.<\/p><p>It may interest the Deputy to know that the Prison Psychology Service proactively target specific cohorts of prisoners including for example, violent offenders with over two year sentence, as well as 18-24 year olds in custody. Assistant Psychologists have been recruited since 2016 and their focus is primarily on mental health and sentence management work with prisoners. They are tasked with engaging and motivating this cohort of prisoners, who are committed to custody on a sentence of one year or more and who do not have a post-release supervision order to develop a sentence plan and to engage in appropriate interventions.<\/p><p>The Probation Service have joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who have post release supervision orders. The strategic objective to have a multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation from pre to post imprisonment in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes, forms a central part of the Prison and Probation Service Joint Strategic Plan.<\/p><p>There is a clear commitment to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  The Joint IPS\/ETBI Education Strategy 2019 - 2021 sets out a commitment to the provision of broad based education provision and includes supporting integration and sentence planning. Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education Training Boards and the IPS and a broad and flexible curriculum is provided. A top priority for the IPS is ensuring help for those with literacy problems, and to this end, peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all prisons.<\/p><p>The IPS has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and Cleanpass and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the IPS to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification to people in custody.<\/p><p>The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities to acquire practical skills which will help secure employment on release.  Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that I recently launched in the &quot;Working to Change Social Enterprise Strategy - 2021-2023&quot; which sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove the systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and the Probation Service and my Department.

This legislation will be on the basis of an aggravated offences model, and will be supported by training across the criminal justice system, as well as victim supports. <\/p><p>- Publish a new national action plan against racism.<\/p><p>In relation to the first commitment, I recently announced my intention to bring forward new legislation to combat incitement to hatred and hate crime in Ireland.

It is my intention to bring the General Scheme to Government before Easter of this year. The new legislation will provide the necessary means to prosecute perpetrators who deliberately or recklessly incite hatred against others on the basis of a protected characteristic, while bearing in mind the provisions of the Constitution and our human rights obligations including those contained in the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to protect the right to freedom of expression. It is my intention to publish the General Scheme of this Bill before Easter.<\/p><p>In relation to the second mentioned Programme for Government commitment, my Department established an independent Anti-Racism Committee chaired by Professor Caroline Fennell (UCC Professor of Law and Commissioner with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission). The Committee is tasked with producing a draft national action plan against racism in accordance with the Programme for Government Commitments within one year. Following on from the transfer of functions, which saw equality matters moved from my Department to Department of Children, Equality, Integration and Youth, the committee provided an interim report to Minister O&rsquo;Gorman at the end of November.<\/p><p>The Committee comprises people from diverse backgrounds from the business, education, local government, academic and advocacy sector, including those with lived experience of racism and it will examine all forms of racism in Ireland.<\/p><p>I am confident that the approach being taken by Government to these commitments  - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views - will help to ensure that the legislation and strategies we develop to combat racism and incitement to hatred will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000093#WRLL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":1778,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000093#WRLL02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1779,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[7154\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000093#WRLL02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners currently incarcerated in each prison throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1780,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of prisoners in custody in each of the prisons is published on a daily basis and this information is available on the Irish Prison Service website <i>www.irishprisons.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>This breakdown includes the number of prisoners in custody and the bed capacity in each prison.

To this end, on 15 January 2021, Minister of State James Browne and I announced the publication of the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  While current law already provides that an adult who causes or uses a child to commit a crime can generally be found guilty as the principal offender &ndash; meaning they can be punished as though they committed the crime themselves &ndash; it does not recognise the harm done to a child by drawing them into a world of criminality.<\/p>  <p>  This new law is designed to address that harm directly. Those found guilty of the new offences face imprisonment of 12 months on summary conviction and up to five years on indictment.  The child concerned does not have to be successful in carrying out the offence for the law to apply.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the intention that the offence of grooming a child into criminal activity will be prosecutable as a completely separate and additional offence to any crime committed by the adult using the child as their innocent agent. Details will be finalised throughout the legislative process. <\/p>  <p>  The new legislation will complement the ongoing work following the publication of the &lsquo;Greentown Report&rsquo; in December 2016, which examined the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland. The report, which was produced at the School of Law in the University of Limerick, outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the wider 'Greentown' project, targeted interventions are to be piloted to further protect children in Ireland from becoming involved in criminal networks. As well as analysing how criminal networks recruit and control often vulnerable children, the Greentown project has attempted to identify the scale of the problem in the State and has designed a bespoke form of intervention, which is being trialled on a pilot basis in two locations.<\/p>  <p>  This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations.    <\/p>  <p>  I will also shortly publish the Vivian Geiran report into the challenges and needs experienced by communities in Drogheda as a result of ongoing feuding activities by criminal gangs, which has been received from Mr Geiran and is under consideration within my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The report examines a range of issues affecting the community, including the needs of young people in the area, the opportunities available to them and the root causes which lead to criminal activity taking hold. <\/p>  <p>  Further to this, Minister of State Browne and I will also be bringing the new Youth Justice Strategy to Government shortly, which will deliver a holistic approach to the issue of youth justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000093#WRLL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Assets Bureau","counter":1790,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000093#WRLL04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1791,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[7158\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000093#WRLL04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the fight against all forms of crime, organised and otherwise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1792,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996.

This is consistent with international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommend that nucleic acid amplification tests, such as RT-PCR, should be used to detect suspected, active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The advice of the WHO and the ECDC is available on their websites. For example, in its Technical Report &ldquo;Options for the use of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 in the EU\/EEA and the UK&rdquo;, published on 19 November 2020, the ECDC confirmed that &ldquo;To date, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly relies on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on a nasopharyngeal specimen. This testing method remains the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and is characterised by both high sensitivity and specificity in detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA).&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays in Ireland are operated in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions, and the CE marking for the assay.  It is the manufacturer that decides the optimal number of cycles for the assay, not the testing laboratory. For commercial assays, the manufacturer chooses the PCR parameters including the amplification cycles. Intentionally moving away from the manufacturer's instruction would invalidate the CE mark.<\/p>  <p>  This position remains unchanged and the WHO Information Notice simply reminds the professionals involved in the analysis of samples using the rRT-PCR to follow manufacturer instructions. SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays in Ireland in use by the HSE and laboratories operating on behalf of the HSE are operated in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions and the CE marking for the assay.<\/p>  <p>  Higher Cycle threshold values typically indicate a lower amount of virus in the sample.  However, the CT value alone does not indicate whether the virus load is increasing or decreasing, it does not indicate whether the individual is infectious or not, and it does not provide an indication of the specimen quality (i.e. how closely the specimen mirrors what is actually happening in the patient's respiratory tract). <\/p>  <p>  In the Irish context, specificity (or false positive) data are not collated centrally.  However, based on the data we do have available, and based on our growing level of experience with the SARS-CoV-2 assays in use in Ireland, the false positive rate is estimated to be somewhere between 0.1% and 0.2% (suggesting a specificity of around 99.8-99.9%).  This does mean that for every 10,000 tests performed, there will potentially be 10-20 false positives, although this number can be reduced by repeat testing of some low level (or weak) positives.  However, it is often not possible to distinguish between true positives and false positives.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing<\/p>  <p>  The HSE continues to monitor the evidence for other testing types in conjunction with other public bodies, such as the Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA), and having regard to best international evidence and advice. On an ongoing basis, the National Public Health Emergency Team considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":1870,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1871,"qnumday":695,"qnumall":"[6338\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting time for a PCR test for a person with symptoms of Covid-19; the waiting time for a PCR test for an asymptomatic close contact of a confirmed case of Covid-19; the waiting time for a PCR test for a symptomatic close contact of a confirmed case of Covid-19; if there is a difference in waiting times for close contacts who are symptomatic and those who are asymptomatic; if so, the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1872,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1873,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1874,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[6344\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the logistics and distribution experts that have been consulted in developing the roll-out processes for the vaccine programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1875,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1876,"content":"<p>Question No. 697 answered with Question No. 690.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1878,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[6346\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current listed position regarding family carers to receive the vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1879,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.  The 2020 National Service Plan provides for 18.9m home support hours to be delivered to 53,700 people and Intensive Home Care Packages delivered to approximately 235 people with approximately 360,000 hours delivered in the full year. <\/p><p>An additional &euro;150 million is being provided for home support in 2021.The very significant additional funding will provide a further 5 million hours over this year&rsquo; target aimed at keeping older people healthy and happy, in their community, for as long as possible.  This represents about a 26% increase in home support hours over the 2020 NSP target.  <\/p><p>The Programme for Government (2020) commits to the introduction of &ldquo;<i>a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care<\/i>.&rdquo; In this regard, the Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs, and that it will also provide transparency about service-allocation while ensuring that the scheme operates consistently and fairly across the country.<\/p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Report<\/i>. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery. <\/p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan commits to the establishment of the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services by the end of 2021. Work planned in 2020, including the planned testing of a reformed model of service delivery, was adversely affected due to the impact of COVID-19 on delivery mechanisms for home support and the requirement for the diversion of resources to deal with COVID-19.  This has had an impact on the final timeline.<\/p><p>The successful development of this scheme is an ambitious programme of reform and is a key priority for me, and the Minister for Health.  In order to accelerate this work, the Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that the required resourcing including personnel, governance structures and other requisite resources are scaled up to ensure that significant progress is achieved by the end of 2021.<\/p><p>Within this context funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll out of InterRAI as the standard assessment for care needs in the community, the testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home support services and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.  All of this work throughout 2021 will progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme.<\/p><p>In parallel, the increased investment in home support services in 2021 will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1898,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1899,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[6368\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000095#WRNN04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has considered introducing documentation for those medically exempt from wearing face coverings to ensure that all those who do not wear masks in retail settings are truly exempt from doing so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1900,"content":"<p>The public health advice relating to COVID-19 is kept under continuous review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), by my Department and the Government.

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.

On 2nd January 2021, the HSE issued correspondence to the Acute hospital system advising of the need to curtail scheduled elective care. This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and the projected trend in admissions based upon community transmission levels of Covid-19. CHI has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive rather than a blanket cessation of all routine activity as was done in March last year. <\/p><p>CHI have confirmed that urgent Outpatient appointments continue to be held face to face, while some routine appointments have been deferred. Many specialties have switched to virtual appointments with some blended face to face appointments where deemed appropriate.<\/p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. <\/p><p>Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as the current two-metre distancing, have had a material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, including scoliosis procedures.

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases). <\/p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017.<\/p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed.<\/p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.<\/p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>   I have recently committed to holding an inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland and have asked officials in my department to examine a number of different options for the structure of this inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000109#WRBBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":2632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000109#WRBBB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2633,"qnumday":964,"qnumall":"[7430\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000109#WRBBB02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the persons or bodies who are members of the implementation committee for the recommendations in Sharing the Vision; when they will commence; and if the committee is a separate entity to the monitoring committee.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2634,"content":"<p>The National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) is collectively responsible for driving and overseeing the long-term implementation of the national mental health policy, <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>.

This was informed by EU Commission observations on Irish forestry policy at the time and was implemented due to environmental, economic and value-for-money reasons. There were many concerns at the time around the failure of plantations on unenclosed land to develop and produce a viable or commercial crop. This was the silvicultural and value for money rationale behind the introduction of the 20% rule.<\/p>  <p>  The Department re-examined this issue in 2016.  In order to address the key concerns regarding planting unenclosed land, (productivity and environment) the Department developed two documents in consultation with stakeholders. These were:<\/p>  <p>  (1) Land Types for Afforestation:  a vegetation classification system that aims to make classing land more objective.  <\/p>  <p>  (2) Environmental Requirements for Afforestation: an environmental Framework that when applied will determine whether the land has an environmental issue or not.<\/p>  <p>  Both documents are now in use and inform DAFM forestry policy.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2016, a Public Consultation process took place around both the new Environmental Requirements document and the case for the removal of the 20% rule.  There was no agreement amongst stakeholders to removing the 20% rule and it was maintained.<\/p>  <p>  To attain state aid approval for the current Forestry programme, an outline of the schemes and associated rules had to be approved by the EU Commission.  The 20% rule and its proposed review were included in the current Forestry Programme.  The Commission indicated subsequently that they were not in agreement with the possible invcrease in planting on unenclosed land. It is a condition of Ireland's state aid approval that the inappropriate planting of sensitive habitats such as certain peatlands and wetlands must be avoided. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of land eligibility has been flagged in the MacKinnon report and Ms Jo O'Hara has been commissioned to advise on the implementation of this report.

It is my immediate priority to increase the number of licences issued.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system, which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. We have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year.  In fact, the number of licences issued in January was the highest number issued in a single month, 349, since July 2019.<\/p><p>Along with Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, who is responsible for forestry, it is my intention to increase the number of licences issued to 4,500 in 2021 which would be an increase of 74% on 2020. We also plan to fill the Coillte felling requirement for 2022 by October and to clear the backlog of files currently with ecology by the end of the year.  Ultimately, the aim is to meet the objective of determining a felling licence within four months of receipt, as set out in the Forestry Act 2014 and to achieve the 18 week timeframe for other approvals as set out in the Farmers Charter. <\/p><p>We have also implemented changes to the functioning of the FAC and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. The FAC is now hearing an average of 60 licences per month representing an increase of 150%.  This increase in output means that applicants are being given certainty in terms of whether they may proceed with their licence.  The FAC in consultation with the Agriculture Appeals Office is currently reviewing ways in which greater efficiency can be achieved across the four divisions of the FAC.<\/p><p>I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000111#WRDDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":2745,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000111#WRDDD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":2746,"qnumday":1003,"qnumall":"[6769\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021000111#WRDDD02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department has given or will give consideration to the issue of wholescale regulatory reform in view of the current crisis facing the forest and timber industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1510","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2747,"content":"<p>The Forestry Act  2014 and the supplemental Forestry Regulation 2017 (SI No. 191 of 2017),  is the primary legislative framework for supporting the development and promotion of forestry in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The regulatory provisions, in particular those for the licensing of certain forestry operations, give effect domestically to the requirements of EU environmental law, environmental policy that falls within the scope of EU law, and the four environmental principles that inform those frameworks.

Research is crucial in providing evidence and improving technologies and the paper found that the AGRIP programme was broadly achieving its objectives. <\/p>  <p>  The paper notes that the Teagasc Sustainability Report highlights that profitable farms are more likely to adopt new technologies and innovative practices and that these are underpinned by research findings such as those provided through AGRIP. The challenge remains to attract other farmers to engage and implement the latest technologies and practices to improve their farm performance.  This was the basis for the recommendation to improve the dissemination of the research findings and to encourage uptake. <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc welcomed the findings of the Spending Review.

We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan.  In 2020, we invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added this year.  This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year.  In addition, January saw the highest number of licences issued in any one month since July 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The total number of licences which issued in 2020 was 2,592, of which 1,717 were tree felling licences.
