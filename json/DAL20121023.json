A local property tax will alter the relationship between the citizen and his or her local authority in a way that will be altogether beneficial for good governance.

These savings have been achieved to date primarily from areas such as staffing and procurement and I expect that further efficiency savings will continue to accrue in these areas and also into the future following the examination of a shared services approach across a number of programmes, particularly on treasury management, transactional human resource issues, shared payroll systems, and ICT back-office functions.  This estimate does not include any reductions in expenditure due to reduced activity.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that payroll savings of &#8364;20 million will be achieved in the period to the end of 2014.  In this regard, a workforce planning process is in progress to determine optimum local authority organisational and staffing requirements.  Significant rationalisation of State agencies in the local government sector is also under way which has achieved savings of &#8364;10 million to date.<\/p><p>  Potential cost savings due to structural reform will arise from local authority mergers and the integration of county and sub-county operations and structures, resulting in elimination of duplication, economies of scale and removal of the need for separate back-office and support units.  While more definitive assessment of costs and savings will become available as implementation proceeds, it is considered that total savings in the range &#8364;40 million to &#8364;45 million relative to 2010 expenditure are achievable through the various structural reforms.<\/p><p>  The changes in local government structures will have some implications, both for local authority revenue and costs.  On the revenue side, savings will be used to reduce commercial rates and harmonise the levels of other charges.  Some one-off costs associated with the transition to the new arrangements, including IT costs to implement revised service arrangements and retirement gratuities, can be expected to arise, but should be quickly recovered through savings.<\/p><p>  I am confident that significant net savings will result from the structural reforms and these will have enduring effect in the budgets of the local authorities.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Moreover, it is important to note that the benefits of the proposed changes cannot be measured adequately in terms of financial savings alone.

Obviously, numbers in this sector can only go so low, as otherwise it will not be able to deliver services to the citizen.  I am very conscious of this.

We have already hit the 2015 target in terms of the employment ceiling set and do not expect to make many further reductions in terms of staff costs.  However, we must examine ways by which we can streamline the structures at higher levels in the local government system, namely, the administrative and director of services levels, in order that we can make savings there rather than in front-line services.  The proposed amalgamations will save money.  The amalgamations to date, in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, have shown that savings of between \u20ac5 million and \u20ac7 million, depending on the local authority involved, will be achieved, once structures are streamlined.

We want to have people at local level to participate in and have the power to make these decisions.  Funding will always be the most difficult part of this.  Where people will raise and spend money at local level, depending on their priorities, it will be difficult.

RAPID area implementation teams, AITs, are important implementation bodies within the county development board, CDB, process.

The report recommended that the county council of Waterford and the city council of Waterford be unified to replace the existing councils with effect from the 2014 local elections.  The committee indicated that it had reached its conclusion having carefully weighed the evidence and considered the concerns about amalgamation raised during the consultation process.  The context for the committee\u2019s deliberations, the approach and rationale adopted in its analysis and the advantages associated with the merger are fully set out in the report.  <\/p><p>  Regarding the boundary areas between counties adjoining Waterford, the implementation group's report recommends the need for more effective arrangements for co-ordinated development planning between nearby counties and the need to develop a multi-authority retail strategy.  Implementation arrangements, similar to those followed in Limerick and Tipperary to date, are being put in place in Waterford.  I have appointed an implementation group which will be chaired by Mr. Se\u00e1n Aylward who chaired the Waterford local government committee to identify further details of the requirements for the merger and oversee the establishment of the arrangements necessary for the reorganisation and transition to a single authority in mid-2014.  The group will produce an implementation plan by the end of June 2013 to provide a blueprint to guide and direct the restructuring process.  I have published the terms of reference and membership of the group.  I expect that planning for the new arrangements will begin immediately.  As was the case in Limerick and Tipperary, it is proposed that a dual management structure will be put in place on an interim basis to manage and drive the restructuring process and the transition to full amalgamation.<\/p><p>Amendment of the Local Government Act 2001 will be necessary for appointment of a single manager to manage both authorities in advance of a merger.

The data from the second quarter of 2012 indicate that 6,280, or 28% of all local authority mortgages, including those drawn down for the purpose of purchasing houses under the various affordable housing schemes such as shared ownership and tenant purchase, are in arrears of more than 90 days.<\/p><p>  The use of 90 days as a comparative metric in considering the level of arrears is consistent with the approach adopted by the Central Bank in compiling information in respect of private lenders' loans.  The Central Bank's data for the same period showed that 10.9% of mortgages in the private sector, including those whose accounts were restructured, were in arrears for more than 90 days.  A further 5.28% of mortgage accounts had been restructured and were performing in accordance with the revised terms.<b><i><\/i><\/b> It is to be expected that the rate of arrears among local authority mortgage holders would be higher than the rate of arrears generally, given the position of local authorities as lenders of last resort.<\/p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based on the Central Bank's first code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner sympathetic to the needs of households, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised code of conduct, which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt, my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers' Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>In particular, the introduction of a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment arrangements that can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, a mortgage-to-rent facility.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.<\/p><p>  With regard to the shared ownership scheme specifically, the rent charged on the local authority's equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates.  Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property - that is, if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority's share, the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.<\/p><p>  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's 2011 housing policy statement announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  That review is now under way and will conclude later in the year.  Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300011#J00375","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1351001400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Durkan.

The ruling highlighted deficiencies in Irish legislation regarding waste water disposed of through septic tanks and similar systems.  The enactment of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, and the subsequent regulations I signed to guarantee effective implementation of that legislation, were therefore necessary to ensure that Ireland achieves compliance with both the ruling and its responsibilities under the waste directive.<\/p><p>  My Department has been in ongoing liaison with the European Commission since the court ruling, particularly with regard to the drafting of the legislation.  The legislative provisions regarding registration of domestic waste water treatment systems and the introduction of a risk-based inspection system are intended to ensure compliance with the court ruling.  The inspection system provided for in the legislation and currently being finalised by the Environmental Protection Agency is also in accordance with the recommendations of the European Parliament and Council of 4 April 2001 regarding the minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the member states.  The European Court of Justice considered an application from the European Commission for the imposition of fines against Ireland at a hearing on 4 October last and the court's decision in this regard is now awaited.  At the hearing the Commission indicated that its primary complaint in the case was the time taken to comply with the ruling rather than the legislative approach that had been adopted by Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is no current scheme of financial support for the upgrading of septic tanks.  I have stated on a number of occasions that I am prepared to consider all possible options to provide financial support to householders whose waste water treatment systems are deemed, following inspection under the new legislation, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  The remedial action required on foot of septic tank inspections under the new system will, in many cases, only mean that householders are obliged to de-sludge their tanks more frequently.  In other cases, householders may be required to carry out repairs to improve the performance of malfunctioning septic tanks.  The provision of any financial support will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and to the financial position of the individual households concerned.  However, it would be inappropriate for me to give any guarantees until the need for financial support is determined.  The extent of problems with domestic waste water treatment systems and the remediation costs arising will not be clear until such time as inspections are being carried out.<\/p><p>  As of 22 October, more than 250,000 owners of  domestic waste water treatment systems have registered online, by post or in person at their local authority offices.  I understand that the central bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency is currently working through the postal and over-the-counter registrations that are to be processed.  The launch of the registration programme in June was accompanied by a public awareness campaign.  Information on how to register and on the fees payable was broadcast by local radio stations nationwide and advertisements were also placed in local and regional newspapers.  Information regarding how to register was also published on a number of websites, including those of the Department, the EPA and local authorities.  During the period from late August to mid-September, local authorities distributed information leaflets to homes in areas without sewerage systems, advising householders of the legal requirement to register by 1 February 2013, along with details of how to register and the reduced registration fee available until 28 September 2012.  It is intended that a further publicity campaign will take place in order to inform householders of their legal responsibility to register by 1 February 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300013#L01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1351002600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his thorough reply.

The EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland contains a commitment to introduce a property tax for 2012.  The programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing, to improve accountability and to align better the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  It was considered that in light of the complex issues involved, a local property tax would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU-IMF programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge on an interim basis in 2012.  This was done via the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.<\/p><p>  An independently-chaired interdepartmental expert group was established under Dr. Thornhill to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable local property tax to replace the household charge.  The expert group's terms of reference were to consider the design of a local property tax which is equitable and is informed by previous work and international experience, as I stated in answer to another question from Deputy Cowen.<\/p><p>  The group submitted its report to me some months ago and these proposals and issues raised in the report will form the Government's consideration of the implementation of this tax in budget 2013.

It is six months since An Bord Plean\u00e1la refused planning permission for the proposed national children's hospital.  At the time an independent assessment, subsequently known as the Dolphin report, was requested by the Minister who informed us it would take one month to complete.  When the Minister received the report on 8 June, he stated a decision would be taken within weeks.  This was followed by a statement in July that the decision would be taken in October.  Today, in a remarkable story, we learned about a further report for the T\u00e1naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who is conducting his own independent research into the preferred location of the new national children's hospital.  Labour Party officials are openly stating they are meeting the various bidders and essentially producing their own report and assessment on the issue.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the behaviour of the Labour Party, in particular the T\u00e1naiste, serves to isolate even further and undermine the role and position of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in the Cabinet.  The T\u00e1naiste and his advisers and officials appear to be indicating that they do not trust the Minister to take the correct decision.  Was the Taoiseach aware that the T\u00e1naiste was pursuing this independent track in respect of the national children's hospital?

The Dolphin report, which was commissioned by the Minister for Health, is in the hands of the Minister, who has been considering it for some time.  Inevitably, questions arise from elements of that.

Because of the panic and desperation of the previous Administration, the blanket guarantee was applied in the way it was.<\/p><p>  Deputy Adams will have read the conclusions of the summit decision on 29 June.  They are very clear.  He will have read the decisions of last Thursday and Friday, which are equally clear.  They put flesh on the principle adopted in June of setting out the legal framework for the conditions, modalities, the mechanics and the organisation of how this will apply.  With over 6,000 banks involved, it is a process that cannot be taken lightly for very good reason.<\/p><p>  From Ireland\u2019s perspective, I welcome the joint statement from the German Chancellor-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300017#P01300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1351005000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Did she speak to the Taoiseach this time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300017#P01400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1351005000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>-----and yesterday\u2019s statement from the French President recognising the unique circumstances of Ireland\u2019s position and that the special case which arises in Ireland will be taken into account in the negotiations that are mandated to be carried out by the euro group.

We have seen several examples of that in the changes made to policies and statements in recent days.  The Taoiseach alone is in a unique position as he was on the telephone call to Angela Merkel on Sunday.  He can tell us whether he asked her if there was any question of writing off legacy debt and, if so, what was her answer to that particular question.  This is the nub of the problem.  It is a very serious life and death matter for the nation.  To answer Deputy Adams\u2019s earlier question, it was the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who yesterday in addressing the issue of bank relief said if we do not get some relief in time we will not be sustainable as an independent state.  That is pretty straightforward.  It means if we do not get a write-off of the debt, we will perish economically.<\/p><p>  With genuine concern I want to make the following constructive suggestion.  The Taoiseach and his other Ministers should go ahead with their diplomatic efforts to get relief on the debt, which has so far proved particularly unfruitful.  However, parallel to this, the Taoiseach should make another telephone call to Angela Merkel to tell her that behind this velvet glove, there is an iron fist.  As Ireland\u2019s debt is unsustainable, as admitted by one of the Taoiseach\u2019s Ministers, the Taoiseach has only two options.  The first is forgiveness by the lenders; the second, unilateral decisions by the borrowers.  The Taoiseach must insist on parking and postponing the payment of the \u20ac3 billion on the Anglo Irish promissory notes due in March if no deal is agreed before then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300017#P01900","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1351005000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300017#P02000","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1351005000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>That way the Taoiseach would bring a pressure point but would also pursue the diplomatic initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300017#P02100","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1351005000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>When I travelled to Brussels for the 29 June summit, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, took the Order of Business.

I can give the Deputy the names here if he so wishes.<\/p><p>  The NESC provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland's economic and social development.  Appointments to the NESC are made in accordance with the provisions of the NESDO Act 2006 as amended by the NESC (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010.  I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  I may also appoint up to six public servants of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  These appointments represent relevant Departments to ensure that the work of NESC is integrated with Government policy making.  Historically, the chairperson and deputy chairperson posts are filled from my Department at Secretary General and assistant secretary level.  NESC members are not entitled to remuneration.<\/p><p>  I appointed eight independent members in June and July last year.  Of these, four were women and four were men.  Women now account for 29% of the council's total membership while men account for 71% of its membership.<\/p><p>  There has been one appointment to the National Statistics Board, NSB since I took office.  The person concerned is an assistant secretary at my Department and was appointed to the NSB in line with the provisions of the Statistics Act 1993.  My functions in respect of the NSB were delegated to the Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, who made the appointment in this case.  No remuneration is payable to this appointee for this role on the NSB.<\/p><p>  In view of the statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the boards of NESC and the NSB, there is limited scope for me to take factors such as gender or whether a person is a member the diaspora into account when I make such appointments.  Under the new arrangements for the appointment of State board members which the Government introduced in 2011, Departments now invite expressions of interest from the public in vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis on their websites.  It is open to all members of the public, including the diaspora, to apply for such positions and all applications will receive appropriate consideration from the Ministers concerned.<\/p><p>  The Government appreciates the willingness of individuals based abroad to serve on State boards.  Several members of the global Irish network have been appointed to State boards and I expect more will be appointed in the future.

The first question was whether the Taoiseach can explain why he reiterated last year a rock-hard commitment that there would be a 40% gender balance rule applied.  Clearly he has not abided by it.  Can the Taoiseach explain the reasons he has not been in a position to abide by it and why the Government has not done so?  The Taoiseach stated that the gender balance was 79% in the context of NESC.  This is a poor target or realisation of the target given what he said so strongly not so long ago.<\/p><p> Second, how many of the appointments were advertised?  We were told on the formation of the Government in the programme for Government that such positions would be publicly advertised.  That is Government policy.

Of course, the reality is very different.  Media research suggests the bulk of new appointees are persons with direct connections with either the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party.  It is argued that for reasons of perception the persons concerned often submit an application, but that it is not a genuine attempt to widen the net to include others who are not connected with the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300018#Q04000","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351006200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>It was Fianna F\u00e1il people who held the positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300019#R00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Prior to the general election we were promised there would be a broadening in the programme for Government.

I am not casting any aspersions on any individuals because I am sure they are fine academics but there are plenty of fine academics across the country.  This is an example of the kind of insider appointments that the Taoiseach was allegedly trying to get rid of.  He was supposed to be broadening, widening and opening the net and it is extraordinary that this did not occur in the context of the NESC appointments.<\/p><p>  The basic point is that what is now happening is far removed from what was promised by the Government in terms of appointments to State boards.  It is a bit of a sham and a con-job, like many of the other commitments that were made.  One of the key reforms of the last Government was introduced by former Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party, who allowed Oireachtas committees to work on the appointment of people to State boards.  That was real reform but we have seen nothing like that from this Government, in terms of openness, transparency or the involvement of the Oireachtas in selecting personnel for boards.  That is the reality.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach must accept that part of Government policy was that board appointments would be advertised.  I found it extraordinary, in that context, that the director of the HSE was selected by the Minister of Health.  It is extraordinary that there was no public advertisement at all.  The director was simply hand-picked by the Minister.  There was no selection or advertising process, which is unhealthy.  I am not casting any aspersions on the individual but that is a very unhealthy situation.  It creates all sorts of unwelcome scenarios and compromises the independence of the individuals who get picked and selected in that way.  It should not happen in the future, in any Department or for any position because it is not good enough.<\/p><p>  Question No.3 relates to the Diaspora and it is my experience that there are many people overseas who are interested in Ireland and would be willing to give of their expertise to serve on State boards.  I actually made some such appointments myself on a number of occasions.  They worked out very well and it is an example that should be followed.

More than ever before, the Opposition and the media must rely on the Freedom of Information Act to check his claims and to seek information which should be in the public domain.  In recent times the Taoiseach's Department has been invoking every legal route possible to prevent access to information.  When I asked for details of the supposed attack on corporation tax, for example, the Taoiseach refused to release the information, claiming a diplomatic exemption.<\/p><p>  Today I wish to ask him about a far more serious issue, namely his casting of a slur on his predecessor.  In both this House and the Seanad, the Taoiseach repeatedly claimed that he had looked for files about the bank guarantee and how it came about but could not even find a single piece of paper on it.  He suggested that perhaps the file was lost behind a radiator.  Deputy Paul Kehoe chipped in with the suggestion that perhaps the file had been destroyed.  Under a freedom of information request, the Taoiseach was forced to admit that there are actually 17 files in his Department, on top of a further 48 in the Department of Finance.  Does the Taoiseach now have the basic decency to withdraw his false attack or will he continue to put partisan attacks ahead of everything?<\/p><p>  I remind the Taoiseach that even though both he and the T\u00e1naiste explicitly said, almost three weeks ago, that all information relating to the primary care centres should be released, we are still waiting for that documentation under a freedom of information request.  Indeed, towards the end of last week, we received a reply to the effect that the Department wants an extension of a further four weeks before it will give us the documentation requested.  This is not open practice.  I do not know how the Taoiseach can be satisfied with the operation of the freedom of information procedures when an answer on an issue of such topicality, that has grabbed the imagination of the public for the last five or six weeks, is still not forthcoming.  The Government is hiding behind the Freedom of Information Act and using it as a shield to prevent the release of information.  The provisions of that Act are all we have left in terms of trying to find out the rationale behind the selection of additional primary care centre sites.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government promised additional legislation but it appears that the Government is quite content to use the freedom of information process and to tell Deputies and Senators to utilise the provisions of that Act to obtain information rather than pre-empting such requests and providing information in the House.  The Government should be trying to ensure that key questions about important topics raised by parliamentarians are not long-fingered or delayed for four weeks or more, in the hope that by the time the information is eventually released, interest will have moved on to some other issue.  I can instance a whole range of issues, from the pension levy onwards, where it has taken months to get basic information as to why decisions were taken.  In no way could the Taoiseach be satisfied with the operation of the Act, from an objective standpoint.  Perhaps he could be satisfied with it from a narrow, political perspective in terms of just wishing to obfuscate and prevent the release of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300020#S00800","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Deputy was in this House or was away with his colleagues when his party in government bulldozed through the gutting of the Freedom of Information Act in 2004.<\/p><p>It was put through the House in one day with no submissions sought.

This is on top of the six weeks it has already taken.  All we are asking for is some basic information.  Why is it not possible just to publish the documentation?

The devolution of justice and policing powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2010 was a significant step forward in the full implementation of the St. Andrews Agreement.  Following the 2011 election, the Alliance Party leader David Ford was reappointed as Minister of Justice by cross-community vote and earlier this year the Executive agreed to extend his mandate beyond the April 2012 sunset clause provided for in the Hillsborough Agreement.<\/p><p>  On strand 2 issues, it provided for a review of the existing North-South bodies to examine them from the points of view of efficiency and value for money.<\/p><p>It was also agreed that the review would look at the case for additional North-South bodies and areas of co-operation, as well as a replacement for the Irish Lights Agency.  In regard to the first element of the review, on value for money and efficiency of the North-South bodies, it was agreed at the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 15 June 2012 to endorse the recommendations concerning the various bodies that had been made by the review group and agreed by Ministers at the relevant sectoral meetings.  Progress has been disappointingly slow with regard to the second and third terms of reference of the review, which include the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the North-South Ministerial Council.  It was agreed at the last plenary meeting on 15 June that the First Minister, Deputy First Minister, T\u00e1naiste and I will reflect and consult with a view to decisions being taken at the next plenary meeting.  While these consultations have yet to be concluded, I hope progress can be made at the next plenary meeting on 2 November in Armagh.<\/p><p> The establishment of a North-South parliamentary forum was proposed as an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  In addition to playing an important role in building understanding and co-operation for the common good of everyone on the island, such a forum would also have a valuable role in advising the Government and the Executive on economic, social and cultural issues with a cross-Border dimension.  Following discussions and consultations, the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Willie Hay, announced in July of this year that agreement had been reached on the establishment of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  The association will provide a forum for regular and formal discussions between Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on issues of mutual interest and concern, as envisaged in the agreements.  Under its terms of reference, the association will meet twice yearly on a rotational basis.  This historic milestone is another major stepping stone in the peace process and should be recognised as such.  I have already congratulated the Ceann Comhairle on his intensive efforts and those of the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I do so again now.  I welcome the holding of the inaugural plenary meeting of the association the Seanad Chamber on Friday, 12 October 2012.  I understand it was very successful.<\/p><p> The establishment of a North-South consultative forum has been discussed at all plenary meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council since the institutions were restored in 2007.  In the interim, the Government facilitated three consultative conferences in Farmleigh, involving social partners and other civil society groups from across the island.  Despite this, progress has not been made.  Regrettably, it appears that the Executive will be unable to advance the issue for the moment.  The establishment of the British-Irish Council secretariat earlier this year in Edinburgh is to be welcomed.  Together with my relevant ministerial colleagues, I have attended three plenary meetings of the British-Irish Council.  The next meeting is scheduled to take place on 26 November in Wales.  A limited number of areas relating to the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement remain to be implemented.  A bill of rights for Northern Ireland is currently under consideration by the British Government following a public consultation in Northern Ireland.  The key issue of an Irish language act, as agreed at St. Andrews, remains unresolved.  Some progress has been made in securing measures to promote and protect the Irish language and Ulster Scots, which have been the subject of recent consultation strategy papers by the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  I hope to see progress on these outstanding issues.<\/p><p> Since my Government came into office, Ministers have attended over 17 North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meetings.  I have attended three plenary meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Across a range of issues, the North-South Ministerial Council is facilitating economic and social activities on a cross-Border, all-island basis.  The next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which takes place on Friday, 2 November in Armagh, will be hosted by the Northern Ireland Executive.  The meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  In this context, the Government is maximising North-South engagement in the run-up to and during the Irish Presidency, including opportunities for participation in Presidency-related events and the secondment of a small number of officials from the Northern Civil Service to work in our system.  The North-South Ministerial Council will consider possible future EU programmes and ongoing co-operation on a range of North South co-operation initiatives.  There may be an opportunity to discuss the north-west gateway initiative.  I also intend to welcome the inaugural plenary meeting of the North South Inter-Parliamentary Association.<\/p><p> The House will be aware that I have initiated a number of sensitive meetings with the families of victims on all sides to hear at first hand how their lives have been affected by atrocities from the Troubles.  I have met the families of victims of the Kingsmills massacre and victims of the Troubles in east Fermanagh.  My officials recently met the Ballymurphy families as part of the preparations for a meeting with me.  My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, is working proactively with his counterpart in the Northern Executive to ensure the decade of centenaries is celebrated on a shared basis and with respect.  We welcomed the 29 September event celebrating the Ulster Covenant as a central part of this process, albeit with concerns around some aspects of parading.  The conflict in Northern Ireland which dominated the British-Irish relationship for decades has been replaced with a peace process opening a space for a relationship to develop which &quot;has never been stronger or more settled&quot;.  Last year marked a turning point in British-Irish relations, which began with the visit to Ireland of Queen Elizabeth.  By any standard, the events of those four days were groundbreaking.  The visit was and is rightly a source of great pride for all the people of these islands.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and I agreed that our joint statement of 12 March last would be the starting point for the realisation of the potential over the next decade of stronger relations for current and future generations living on both islands.  The joint statement now provides a framework within which work is being carried forward on further joint actions and collaboration over the medium to longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300022#U04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351008600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that the basic infrastructure put in place under the Belfast Agreement means that meetings, committees and engagements keep going on no matter what.  It is also fair to say that very little progress can be achieved if all sides are simply going through the motions.  That is sometimes the sense one gets as one observes the situation.  That is what we are getting from the Government and from some of the political parties involved.  There is an urgent need to avail of the framework created by the St. Andrews Agreement within which certain issues can be pursued.  It is clear that by any yardstick, the Assembly and the Executive are not working optimally.  Much more needs to happen if the Executive and the Assembly are to be seen to be working for the better interests of people.  In the last year and a half, I have not discerned any single initiative to move the process forward.  I do not think the Taoiseach has spent enough time on the issue.  I would like to ask him about the case for additional North-South bodies.  Has he suggested any particular additional bodies, or additional areas of co-operation between North and South, that could be created under the St. Andrews Agreement or under the review of North-South bodies?  If he has, could he outline to the House the areas that might be involved?  What is the roadblock in terms of their pursuit?  The Taoiseach said that \"progress has been disappointingly slow\" on the North-South agenda.  That is my observation as well.  That is why I said what I said recently.  At the initial stage of the Good Friday Agreement, significant progress was made under the auspices of a range of North-South bodies like Waterways Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  There is now a sense that momentum is being lost and people are just going through the motions.  What is the Taoiseach's agenda now in terms of moving the North-South issues on and in terms of the broader implementation of the St. Andrews Agreement?  What does he want to achieve in his discussions on the North-South axis and on the British-Irish axis?  Has he raised the question of an Irish language act with the British Prime Minister recently?  What is his sense in terms of progress with the formulation of such an Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300023#V00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1351008600,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I did not raise the specific Irish language issue with David Cameron.  The strategic partnership agreement that we signed enhances the relationship between Ireland and Britain, and between here and Northern Ireland, to a great extent.  I do not have any great wish to set off on the appointment of a plethora of new bodies for the moment.  Before I give the Deputy a view of some of the things we are interested in and where some activity is taking place, I will reiterate that much more can be done and emphasise that it would be much easier if this economy were in a strong and thriving position.<\/p><p>For instance, in the transport area, the Ministers have agreed on a detailed timetable for drafting the passage and enactment of parallel legislation North and South by 31 December 2014 to allow the mutual recognition of penalty points across the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> Tourism Ireland continues to build on the success of the 2011 marketing campaigns, which resulted in an increase in overseas visitors for the first time since 2007.  Given the success of the Irish Open held in Northern Ireland and the world rankings of a small but influential number of golfers here, this speaks for itself.  Next year, of course, Derry has Fleadh Cheoil na h\u00c9ireann and is the international City of Culture, and there is a great deal of activity going on between tourism areas North and South.<\/p><p> InterTradeIreland is working to encourage and stimulate a great deal of co-operation to increase applications to the EU framework programme, including enhanced levels of participation by small and medium-sized enterprises.  At the Council meeting on Thursday and Friday, leaving aside other matters that were discussed, there was quite a discussion on the Compact for Growth and Jobs, with particular emphasis on SMEs across the EU, in which 18 million people are unemployed.  Earlier in the year the Special EU Programmes Body had a successful open call for INTERREG applications, with 91 applications requesting over \u20ac217 million.<\/p><p> In the environment field, a great deal of progress has been made on the repatriation of illegally dumped waste, which I consider important.  Education is a sector of great promise and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and his counterpart are active in this regard.  Among the work being undertaken is a joint attitudinal survey to inform cross-Border pupil movement and school planning and liaison between the two teaching councils, with the object of facilitating greater mobility of teachers across the island.<\/p><p> In health, there is ongoing co-operation on a minimum unit price for alcohol and proposals for a North-South alcohol forum to develop strategies on alcohol in both jurisdictions, on which the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, will be working.  Planning is well advanced for the establishment of the radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin; construction will commence in 2013 and the unit will be operational in 2016.  The Deputy is also aware of the position regarding the A5 and A8 roads.<\/p><p> I refer also to the statement by the Minister for Finance that a great deal of work is ongoing with regard to research into illegal activity in diesel, which is so important for both economies.  The aim is to have the capacity to trace movement of volumes of diesel and to have an ingredient that cannot be washed out in order to deal with the illegal activities which have gone on for a long time.  Despite the current budgetary challenges, the Government remains fully committed to the PEACE III projects and will see that they continue.<\/p><p> There is a measure of work that each of the groups and bodies can do and I would like to see progress in this regard before we set out with a range of achievements in just setting up new bodies.  To be honest, I am not aware of the difficulties that apply with regard to the Ulster Scots and Irish language Bill but that is an issue I intend to take up when I visit the North in the not-too-distant future.  I also want to reflect on the issue of the Bill of Rights and examine the current situation in that regard.  As I said, I spoke to the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, briefly on Thursday and Friday and discussed a number of issues I hope to follow through with him over the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300023#V00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351009200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I am somewhat concerned.

Medical cards have dominated much of the debate in recent months in that there was a proposal to cut their number and so on.  I find it one of the hardest things in public life to get an answer stating a person suffering from cancer cannot be given a medical card.  I raised this issue in the House only a number of months ago with the former Minister of State, Deputy R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall.  At the time she was in the middle of making a change, which I understood and accepted.  However, I raise the issue again because I remain concerned that we have not arrived at a situation where people diagnosed with cancer, in particular the self-employed, can qualify for a medical card.  Financial information is looked for, but the matter is very simple.  When the oncologist sends a letter notifying that a person has cancer, he or she should be entitled to a medical card, at least for a short period until the financial and other issues have been cleared.  My question is very specific.  I raise the matter again today to ask that in a situation when a person is diagnosed with cancer, he or she immediately receive a medical card.  The position is unfair.  It is traumatic both for the person involved and his or her family.  Cancer affects many people and their families.  I implore the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to act.  Other countries also have dire financial problems and other issues that must be dealt with, but the reality is that we must look after sick and vulnerable people with cancer who are going through a very stressful period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300026#Y01400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1351010400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.<\/p><p>  More than 1.8 million medical cards have been issued to individuals, the highest number in the history of the State.  It represents an increase of approximately 500,000 since the end of 2008.  It is expected that the provision of GP services and prescription drugs under the general medical services scheme will cost almost \u20ac2 billion in 2012.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, medical cards are provided for persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under the legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness such as cancer.  There is, however, a provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card in cases of undue hardship where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.<\/p><p>  On the fast-tracking of medical card applications for certain categories, it is important to point out that the HSE already has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or medical consultant.  This can be initiated through the local health office by the office manager who has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact within the PCRS.  As a result, there are no plans to establish a new unit given that this regime is in place.<\/p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency medical cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency medical card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  No means test applies to an application by a terminally ill patient.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure the person receives the medical card as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  If an individual is unhappy with a decision made by the HSE on a medical card application, he or she has a right of appeal to the HSE appeals officer.  The contact details of the appeals officer are provided by the HSE at the time of informing a person of a decision on his or her application.  The appeal should be lodged within 21 days from the date of the decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300026#Y01500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351011000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I accept that matters have improved.

It would never be the intention or wish of the HSE or any of us to discommode individual applicants, particularly those in the kind of circumstances outlined by the Deputy.  I reiterate that there are more than 1.8 million medical cards and in excess of 130,000 GP-visit cards in circulation.  This means that almost 43% the population is covered by either medical cards or GP-visit cards.  As stated earlier, the number of people in possession of these cards has increased enormously since 2009.  The centralisation of the applications process has improved matters.  Notwithstanding that difficulties may have been experienced or observed along the way, as Deputy Tom Hayes has acknowledged there have been manifest improvements.  I cannot state that we have achieved perfection but the system has definitely improved.  I observed that the latter was the case even before I took up my new position.  We want these improvements to continue.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Tom Hayes has also acknowledged, the primary care reimbursement service unit in Finglas is processing in the region of 30,000 to 40,000 applications on average each month.  We have taken a range of steps to improve the system.  The Deputy referred to an individual case.  In that context, the HSE is reporting - I have no reason to question its information in this regard - that in excess of 95% of completed applications and renewals are processed within 15 working days.

I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy White, who has a fair degree of expertise in respect of Labour Court recommendations and who recognises their importance, is present.  I look forward to his reply.<\/p><p>  I wish to focus on the abject failure of the HSE to offer contracts to people employed as home helps and home care workers.  Everyone is aware that these workers are predominantly female and that they play a pivotal role in the context of the HSE's home care and community care strategies.  On 29 June 2012, the chairperson of the Labour Court made a recommendation - LCR 20312 - that the 2009 agreement regarding contracts for home helps, which refined an earlier agreement reached in 2007, &quot;was reasonable and practical in circumstances where the hours of work of the home help service fluctuate to such an extent&quot;.  The chairperson also recommended that the 2009 agreement should be used to conclude a final agreement which would address all issues raised by the unions and take account of the various matters raised by the HSE.  She stated that discussions should be completed by the end of July, with the proviso that if there any issues outstanding, these could be referred back to the court for a definitive recommendation.  Notwithstanding their best efforts to engage in a meaningful and constructive manner, the trade unions have been frustrated by the ongoing failure of the HSE to appoint an appropriate person of specific seniority to deal with this issue and assist in reaching an agreement that would be in everyone's interests, particularly those of home helps and the people to whom they provide services.  I understand the Labour Court is equally frustrated by the dilatory behaviour of the HSE.<\/p><p>  There were 12,356 home helps in 2008 or 2009 but their number had decreased to 9,384 as of 1 October last.  Even with a decrease in the available budget, these home helps have continued to deliver the traditional and tremendous service that has always been provided.  Since July, the number of home helps has decreased since 2%.  This means that 10.25 million hours of home help services must be delivered by the 9,384 individuals to whom I refer.  I deplore the reduction relating to this service.  It is foolhardy to take away money from home helps, who play an extremely important role in keeping people comfortable and happy and ensuring that they can remain in their own homes and neighbourhoods.  The amount it costs to put someone in a nursing home dwarfs that which is required to provide them with home help.  It is about time those in the HSE removed their blinkers.<\/p><p>  It is generally accepted that the working hours of home helps are not constant.  In that context, some home helps could be offered redeployment if there was a reduction in their hours.  This would mean that the HSE would not be obliged to engage in expenditure relating to agency work.  The home helps and their trade unions are prepared to be flexible and adaptable but the HSE has been obstinate.  Home helps are being treated as third-class workers.  Some of them have been sent home, while others have been informed that they are on zero contract hours.  A unilateral decision was taken to reduce their hours of work without any consultation whatsoever.  This is 2012, not 1912.  Home helps are surely entitled to be protected under the Croke Park agreement.  In that context, there should be no displacement of their pivotally important work.<\/p><p>  Home helps possess many skills.  Some of them might have the necessary skills to allow them to work in the hospital service or they could share their hours of work between community and hospital services.  However, they are not being afforded any recognition of the central role they play in the provision of health services.<\/p><p>  It is disconcerting that the HSE has engaged - at great cost to itself - to privatise the home help service.  I have seen the figures in this regard.  We must ask whether the dilatory behaviour in which the HSE is engaging is part of a programme it has adopted in order to facilitate its agenda of privatising the home help service to a greater degree.  Home helps employed by the HSE have been left with no safety net and are not being afforded equality of treatment.  The latter is important.  The HSE has blatantly resiled from implementing the guarantee of income clause which is set out in the agreement to which I refer.  Surely home helps employed by the HSE are entitled to contracts of employment which reflect the hours they work.  The HSE must honour the contractual arrangements in place and we must ensure work for the number of hours specified in contracts is provided.<\/p><p>  We all know the value of home helps.  They provide an invaluable service to older and vulnerable persons.  I do not want to see a continuation of what has been happening to them, namely, the HSE outsourcing their work to the private sector.  The HSE's actions in this regard have been greatly assisted by the fact that its home helps do not have meaningful contracts.  It is past time the HSE behaved with the decency and decorum one would expect of any reasonable employer, especially a State employer.  Its behaviour to date in respect of home helps has been less than stellar.  On the contrary, it has been shameful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300027#Z00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1351011000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I wish to acknowledge his strong and impressive track record on the issue of carers and home helps for many years.  As the Deputy noted, I had some experience of the Labour Court in a previous professional life.  I was often - as I am sure he was - at the receiving end of its various recommendations, not all of which were favourable to those whom I was representing.  I very much value the court and the industrial relations machinery of the State - both of which are important - and I would always encourage engagement with them.<\/p><p>I value the importance of the Labour Court and the industrial relations machinery of the State.  I encourage all parties at all times to engage with those institutions.<\/p><p> My Department and the HSE recognise the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes and communities in accordance with Government policy.  The HSE directly employs about 4,000 home helps.  The number of hours worked by these staff varies according to service needs given that the home help service requires a unique set of arrangements to achieve the level of flexibility required.<\/p><p> The HSE has announced a reduction in the provision of home help hours as one of a number of measures required to address the current budget deficit, subject to home help services continuing to be available to those assessed as requiring them.  A national contract of indefinite duration for home helps employed by the Health Service Executive was agreed in 2006 with the relevant trade union as part of the work of the high level group established to review home help services.  The contracts of home help workers employed by the HSE have been the subject of further deliberation, including Labour Court consideration in the interim years.  <\/p><p> As the Deputy mentioned, the terms and conditions of home helps employed by the HSE were covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative unions in 2009.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage on matters concerning home help contracts and in the event of there being any outstanding issues which could not be agreed that these would be referred back to the court.  The HSE engaged with SIPTU and advised that as part of the process it would be undertaking an information-gathering exercise to ascertain the up-to-date position on the nature of the contracts held by home helps and the hours worked.  This exercise is in train.<\/p><p> On 15 October 2012, having met with the parties again, the Labour Court recommended that the parties should re-engage under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and that this process should be completed by 30 November 2012.  To assist the parties the court has identified the following issues to be considered: mechanisms to define specified hours; a protocol to be followed where specified hours are not met; qualifications for re-deployment; the question of privatisation, the use of agency providers and the establishment of financial data.<\/p><p> I fully appreciate the difference that quality home care can make to individuals and their families.  It is widely acknowledged, both in Ireland and internationally, that the home help service is one of the key services in the community care of older people.  The Government will make every effort, despite significant resource pressures, to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300027#Z00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351011600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I take everything the HSE says with a pinch of salt and a very good sprinkling of salt.

Allowing for the August holiday period, it should have been completed by the end of September.  I hope the chairperson of the Labour Court takes this on board and moves ahead in the absence of the HSE.  If the HSE does not come back by 30 November, I will be back here to ask about it in the House.  The HSE will do everything to shilly-shally its way out of an agreement.  I will not allow home helps across this country to be treated in a way that we had to fight against in the lock-out.  The Minister of State will appreciated the historical import of the lock-out.  It is time that the gloves come off.  The HSE has been warned.  It should become involved in the process in a meaningful way with people of stature and seniority who can conclude the agreement.  The unions are prepared to be flexible as are the workers.  They are even prepared to suggest solutions such as clustering of home help recipients so that a home help is not travelling ten miles to deliver the service but will stay within three or four miles.  There are lots of money-saving suggestions.  I agree that money is important but so are people's livelihoods and so are 39-hour contracts.

I raise a matter which is not unlike the previous issue as it is to do with community schemes to provide employment for the unemployed and for those who wish to make a contribution to their community.  The home care issue is very relevant to this matter.  Many people are of the view that community employment schemes should be extended to include home care.  I was informed by HSE west that 79,000 hours of home help is available for 2,500 people in County Galway.  This sounds impressive but there will be a loss of 12,000 hours per month.  Community employment schemes could be extended to that area.<\/p><p>  However, there seem to be differing rules and regulations governing three schemes and I will provide some examples.  In the past if a community wished to prioritise a particular project such as building a wall, a meeting room or a group water scheme, the community employment schemes provided some assistance.  For example, the extension or development of a graveyard would have been regarded as a local project.  However, this does not seem to be the case now.  Community employment schemes are not always permitted to become involved in such projects.  There seems to be no difficulty as to the type of community work carried out under a rural social scheme nor are there time limits on the number of years a participant may be on the scheme.  The big drawback is that a herd number is required in order for a person to qualify which means that person must be involved in the agriculture sector.  That rules out quite a number of people from the scheme.<\/p><p>  When Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was the Minister responsible he introduced the T\u00fas scheme which provides at least one year's work.  My understanding is that a person cannot revert to community employment after completing one year on T\u00fas.<\/p><p>  I support all the schemes but there is a need for more places.  There is also a case for retaining as many people as possible on these schemes because some have specialist skills who make a significant contribution to the schemes.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the rules and regulations.  One regulation states that community employment schemes may not work on graveyard projects.  I refer to work to extend a graveyard by building a wall and this is a good example of the type of work that could be carried out.  I refer in particular to the extension to Killyon graveyard in Newbridge, County Galway, near where I live.  It was not possible to complete the work on that scheme because it was decided it was not a community project.  The Department should allow works such as graveyard extension to be completed under a community employment scheme.  I know this is what the people of Newbridge and Killyon would like to see happen.<\/p><p>  There are many examples of community work that should be permitted.  It is very unfair that two neighbours may be working on two different schemes but they are treated differently.  They are both trying their best to work for the good of the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300028#AA00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1351012200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The employment schemes to which he refers came within the remit of the Department of Social Protection at the beginning of 2012.  Community employment is an active labour market programme, with the emphasis on progression into employment and-or further education and training.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration given to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.<\/p><p>  The primary purpose of community employment is as a transitional programme to reintegrate the long-term unemployed and other specified disadvantaged groups into open labour market jobs.  The programme is designed to provide fixed-term, temporary opportunities for persons on the live register who have been unemployed for a minimum of 12 months and in receipt of certain social welfare payments for specified periods.  Participants on the programme work for an average of 19.5 hours per week and may also avail of training opportunities.  Participation on the programme can vary from between one and seven years based on age and qualifying eligibility.<\/p><p>  Under the community employment programme, public sector and voluntary organisations known as community employment sponsors are grant-aided by the Department in respect of sponsoring a community employment project.  In turn, they benefit in a secondary way by being able to carry out worthwhile work which they could not otherwise undertake.  Suitable projects are those that can be shown to respond to a clearly identified community need and develop the work skills of participants, thereby enhancing their prospects of obtaining a mainstream job.  Revised community employment guidelines have been published recently and will be updated as and when required.<\/p><p>  The community employment scheme, rural social scheme and T\u00fas are employment programmes administered by the Department of Social Protection.  The schemes have different target groups and overall aims, although they are similar in many respects.   Participation on the community employment programme and rural social scheme is voluntary, while participants on T\u00fas are selected by the Department of Social Protection.  Each scheme has its own rules and regulations in line with the overall aims of each programme.<\/p><p>  The rural social scheme is aimed at low income farmers and fishermen and fisherwomen.  It provides a supplementary income where participants are unable to earn an adequate living from farming or fishing.  To qualify for the scheme a person must be in receipt of certain social welfare payments and in return he or she provides services that benefit rural communities.  The Department has overall responsibility for policy on the rural social scheme, including eligibility criteria.  At a local level, the scheme is managed by implementing bodies such as local development companies and, in the Gaeltacht areas, \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta.<\/p><p>  A participant on the rural social scheme works 19.5 hours per week based on a schedule that is friendly to farming and fishing.  This is done to ensure participation on the scheme does not affect a person's farming or fishing activities.  Contracts run from the commencement date up to the following 31 March and participants may be considered for a further term following the initial contract if they continue to meet all the criteria for the scheme.  Local management decides on each participant's renewal application.  While it is not intended that anyone would remain on the scheme permanently, there is no definite time limit for participation.<\/p><p>  T\u00fas, on the other hand, is an activation initiative for those who are unemployed and on the live register.  The initiative aims to support the work readiness of those who participate.  It provides short-term quality and suitable working opportunities for people who are unemployed, while carrying out beneficial work within communities.  It is hoped the scheme will contribute to the management of the live register and act as a disincentive to those who are not eligible for welfare benefits.  Participants will be identified in the first instance by the Department of Social Protection by satisfying the following conditions.  He or she will have been continuously unemployed for at least 12 months and &quot;signing&quot; on a full-time basis; be in receipt of a jobseeker's payment from the Department of Social Protection for at least 12 months; and be currently in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>  The Department will identify and contact persons on the live register who satisfy the criteria and offer them the opportunity to be considered for local placement as opportunities arise.  When those identified agree to participate they will be referred to the local development company or \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta office operating in their area for interview and consideration for placement.  The local development companies and \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta will maintain a panel from which persons will be recruited.  As placement opportunities arise, those on the panel will be matched with the work and recruited.  Prior to being offered a placement, it will be necessary to ensure that a person's general suitability for the work involved and his or her experience of similar work is established.  This will be done at local level by relevant bodies.  All types of work can be offered and details of the jobs available will be provided at an interview with the implementing body.  Work will be community based and attempts will be made to match the person's skills and location to available work placements.  It is obligatory to respond to any offer made to participate on T\u00fas by the Department.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Kitt may be aware, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, requested a review of the overall employment support schemes to ensure we obtain the best possible value from them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300029#BB00100","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351012200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>The community employment programme, rural social scheme and T\u00fas initiative are highly beneficial and much good work has been done under them.

Gleann Riada estate is an isolated estate that is located approximately one mile outside Longford town and does not have public transport links.  I was taken aback by the litany of problems encountered by residents.  There are slightly more than 80 dwellings housing approximately 300 men, women and children.  Most residents have shared ownership and council mortgages, with nine of them in receipt of rent supplement.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State is aware, Gleann Riada is an unfinished estate on which a full block of apartments was pulled down earlier this year.  The homes were built on a flood plain and the developer availed of section 23 tax exemptions.  Two explosions in houses in the past seven months are suspected to be the result of leaking sewer gases caused by the insufficient and substandard sewerage network on the estate. <\/p><p>There is a terrible smell of sewage and other noxious gases, which has resulted in a large number of visits to local GPs for residents, who have missed work or school as a consequence.  Residents throughout the estate report high rates of illness, and they are clear about who they believe is responsible.  Local GPs are backing up these claims and are reporting higher rates of illness in Gleann Riada compared to other estates.  There is visible subsidence under paths, shores and boundaries around the dwellings.  One row of buildings which I am told should not have been occupied was occupied but it had no suitable fire escape.  All it had was a door which led to a one-storey drop; the door was in place but there was no visible way out.<\/p><p> I visited a couple of the houses where gas monitors were in place.  There was a very bad smell of sewage.  The HSE and the local authorities have advised people living in these houses in what it has deemed as an unsafe estate to keep their windows open.  Families struggling to make ends meet in what has become a living hell are being told, as winter sets in, to keep their windows open.  These families are afraid to turn on the heating or light fires, cookers or even a cigarette for fear of another explosion.  The HSE has said it is unsafe, yet people are still moving into the estate on rent supplement from the HSE.  The State is actually subsidising the endangerment of these people.<\/p><p> The families are asking to be evacuated and accommodated elsewhere until the issues are resolved for once and for all.  Is the Minister aware that the HSE has said this is an unfit and unsafe estate?  Is he aware the estate was built on a flood plain?  Is he aware that the HSE and Longford County Council have asked residents to keep their windows, doors and vents open, not to light fires and to smoke outside?  I visited some of these houses.  The chimneys are not properly secured, paths are sinking, the sewerage systems are substandard, and there are no proper radon layers<i>.  <\/i><\/p><p> I have a number of questions for the Minister.  Who signed off on this estate?  Why is the HSE continuing to offer rent supplement in the estate?  Is the Minister aware that a HSE primary care centre has been built in a neighbouring field in the same flood plain?  That primary care centre is essential for Longford, but why was it built in that location on a flood plain?  What were the criteria used to make that decision?  What investigations have been carried out into the standards that applied in this regard with planners and others in Longford County Council?<\/p><p> Having visited this estate and spoken to the residents about all the issues that have been raised, I am of the view that it should be evacuated.

An explosion occurred within a private house - one of a terrace of six houses - in the Gleann Riada development in Longford in March of this year.  Subsequently, Longford County Council appointed a firm of consulting engineers, Tobin Consultants, to investigate the causes of the explosion.  The specific findings of the report from Tobin Consultants have been made available to residents of the terrace in Gleann Riada, in addition to general advice which was made available to other residents of the estate.  Longford County Council has established a steering group to address the range of issues faced by the occupants of the Gleann Riada development and is liaising with the other State authorities involved including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the Health and Safety Authority.<\/p><p>  Given that this matter is currently the subject of legal action it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time, save to note that the Minister is aware of a second explosion having occurred in this development earlier this month and is following developments in respect of this estate closely.

She is chairing the national co-ordination committee on unfinished housing developments to oversee implementation of the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments, together with the Government's response to the recommendations.  The committee comprises representatives from the banking sector, the local authorities, NAMA and the construction sector, as well as from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, considers that harnessing these various areas of expertise in a collaborative approach will result in the most effective resolution of the issues we face, many of which were set out by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Outputs from this committee so far include the preparation of a guidance manual, Managing and Resolving Unfinished Housing Developments, published in August 2011; the preparation of a key stakeholders' code of practice and a residents' guide, both published last week; overseeing a public safety initiative which provides funding support of &#8364;5 million; improved national and local co-ordination through the City and County Managers' Association; engagement and co-ordination of initiatives with NAMA; engagement with the banking sector through the Irish Banking Federation; and reviewing best practice initiatives and progress on the preparation of site resolution plans nationally.

The reports I have from people living in the estate as to what is happening, the state of some of the houses, and the fact that a second explosion occurred within a short time after the previous one indicates that there is something seriously wrong in the estate.  The gap is so big one can see underneath the houses, and it is clear the ground is sinking.  It is built on a swamp.<\/p><p>  That brings me to another issue.  The HSE rented a field beside this estate and put a new primary care centre, which nobody disputes is badly needed for the Longford area, in it.

Like him, the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, is committed to resolving what is a spectrum of issues that have arisen not only in regard to Gleann Riada, which is the one the Deputy has raised, but the problems being experienced nationally by residents in unfinished housing developments, which is an acute and difficult issue.<\/p><p>Under the public safety initiative for unfinished housing developments, the Department has made allocations totalling \u20ac3.38 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues.  The works approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  In respect of the development at Gleann Riada, Longford, the Department approved funding totalling \u20ac91,753 in August to cover the cost of addressing immediate public safety concerns there.  Developments in 20 other local authority areas have also been supported under the public safety initiative.  <\/p><p> The first annual progress report of the national co-ordination committee on unfinished housing developments, NCC, published by the Department on 5 July, confirmed that significant progress had been made nationally on the issue.  While 2,876 estates had been identified as unfinished in the previous baseline survey, this number had been reduced to 2,066.  It should be noted, however, that not all of these developments are seriously problematic, although many are.  The Minister anticipates this progress will be reflected in the 2012 national housing development survey now under way.  The results of that survey are expected later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300030#CC00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008: Amendments from the Seanad","time":1351013400,"counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300031#DD00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351013400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1351013400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 1 to Seanad amendment No. 1 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300031#DD00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351013400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 1:Section 1: In page 3, lines 16 to 19, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:&#8220;(3) This Act shall come into operation on enactment save in respect of entities that were not reviewable agencies under the Principal Act immediately prior to the enactment of this Act.

There is nothing more frustrating for the public to have a complaint sent back to the original body by the Ombudsman because procedures were not dealt with properly in the first instance.  I would be worried if the legislation took effect next week as some bodies may not have had the opportunity to put their procedures in place.

That sounds more complicated than it needs to be but we are bringing new entities under the scope of the Ombudsman, sometimes in part rather than the entire entity.  This will give the Minister the power to bring part of the remit to them.  We will deal with this in detail later.  This technical amendment will enable me to do that.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 5 amends the definition of a reviewable agency to provide that it encompasses new public entities which will be brought in automatically in future and non-public entities brought in by order as well as those entities within the meaning of the First Schedule, except to the extent that some elements of those entities are excluded, as I have already noted.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 6 is a lengthy one.  It provides that subject to consultation with the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children and the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and with the consent of the relevant Minister, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform make may an order to bring non-public bodies, as may be considered appropriate having regard to the need to ensure appropriate accountability within the remit of the Ombudsman.  I propose to extend the remit of the Ombudsman to bodies that are substantially funded by the State.  Such bodies may not be public bodies but they may get substantial funding from the State in future, with the agreement of the Ombudsman.  It  also provides that such entitles could be brought within the remit with some elements excluded and in such cases an order should not be made until a positive resolution of the draft has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 10 provides that the Ombudsman is precluded from investigating an action taken on behalf of an exempt agency and an action take by or on behalf of a reviewable agency if that action is excluded from review under Part II of the First Schedule of this Act.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 12 is technical.  It provides that excluded bodies or functions under the justice remit, for example, bodies relating to the administration of prisons, be removed from section 5 which is the exclusion section of the original 1980 Act and instead be excluded in a schedule to the Bill.  This is important to facilitate future decision making regarding the remit of the Ombudsman in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  As the position stands, if the current exemption were maintained in primary legislation no future change could be made to the Bill.  We held long discussions in the other House on this matter and I hold strong views on it.  Certain agencies may be excluded at present but we may wish to include them in future.  I am keen to be able to do that without having to bring further legislation to these Houses and the idea of the amendment is that I can simply bring them in.  The proposed amendment will allow a change to be made by secondary legislation, that is, statutory instrument, subject to the processes set out in the Bill.  The functions subject to these changes include the administration of the law relating to naturalisation and the administration of the prisons as well as permitting bodies such as the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to be brought within the remit by way of ministerial order.<\/p><p>  A debate on these bodies took place in the Seanad and a strong and coherent case was made by the Opposition in respect of them.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is committed to bringing forward the necessary legislation to ensure an effective and robust complaints system is put in place in the prison system on foot of the excellent reports of the prisons inspectorate.  We can all rejoice in the robustness of the reports of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention on the activities in the prisons.  The Minister intends that these reports cannot be suppressed in the intended legislation and that there would be a requirement to publish them within a tight timeframe of the receipt of the reports.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman indicated in her recent meeting with the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions - I gather the two Deputies opposite are on the committee - that her priority is to ensure that independent and transparent appeals processes are put in place rather than the question of which public body should be assigned responsibilities for these areas.  The view has been put to me by the Minister for Justice and Equality that on foot of the recommendations of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention a coherent argument can be put for a statutory complains system in the prison system that can deal in a timely matter with day-to-day complaints.  Rather than having the Ombudsman and a new statutory prisons inspectorate doing the same thing, calling the same witnesses and demanding the same papers at the same time, it is better to have a robust system in place.  I have indicated that if necessary at a later date I will extend the powers of the Ombudsman to review this.  One of the important, innovative measures in the legislation, a measure I imagine the Deputies will welcome, proposes to give a statutory role to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  I understand the committee is chaired by an eminent member of Deputy McDonald's party.  The committee may make recommendations for bodies not within the remit of the Ombudsman to come within the remit.  I assure the House that I will have careful regard to any such recommendations.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are full Schedules.  These amendments serve to substitute retrospectively for the First Schedule and Second Schedule of the 1980 Act.  The bodies that currently come within the remit of the Ombudsman and those bodies which are excluded from it are set out in the two Schedules in the 1980 Act.  The amendments will delete the existing schedules and replace them with new Schedules.  Part I of the First Schedule will contain a general definitional provision for public bodies.  All public bodies will be automatically captured in the Ombudsman's remit through the general definition except for those specifically excluded in whole or in part.  I am reversing the way it was done in the past.  If one is not specifically excluded one will be included in future.  We will narrow down those excluded and a coherent case will have to be made for exclusion.  This process encompasses those bodies previously proposed for inclusion in the 2008 Bill but it goes a good deal further than the Bill passed by this House in that it comprehends all public bodies unless they are specifically excluded in the Schedules.  All public bodies are in unless they are specifically out.  This is a more comprehensive way of doing it.  At present the Ombudsman has jurisdiction of some 35 Departments, Government offices and agencies as well as all local authorities and voluntary hospitals.<\/p><p>  Drawing from a comprehensive census of the population of non-commercial State bodies, research published by the Institute of Public Administration as well as work carried out by my Department, it is now estimated that more than 140 additional bodies will be brought within the Ombudsman's remit in terms of agencies and educational institutions.  This is a remarkable increase in the oversight available and charged to the Ombudsman.  This will be further extended when significantly funded non-public bodies will also be brought within the remit of the Ombudsman.  The proposed extension applies in particular to the education sector, in which some 40 third level institutions, 33 vocational education committees as well as several agencies proposed to come within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction for the first time.  This is significant and an extension of the Ombudsman's remit on an unparalleled basis.  The Ombudsman's office has been closely consulted in these approaches on a step-by-step basis.  Following consultation on the matter involving my Department, line Departments and the Office of the Ombudsman it is clear that it is not appropriate or necessary to bring certain categories of public bodies or elements of public bodies within the remit.  The Ombudsman's remit has always focused on public bodies that have a close interface or direct engagement with significant numbers of the public on account of particular roles or responsibilities that such bodies exercise in terms of administrative decision making.  Therefore, there is no case to include expert public bodies with specialised advisory or research functions and which do not deal with the public by and large, including ComReg, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Commission for Aviation Regulation.<\/p><p>  Part II of the First Schedule comprises those public bodies which have been partially included within the Ombudsman's remit following consultation with line Departments.  The Second Schedule lists the bodies not subject to the remit.<\/p><p>For example, it is now proposed to list An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na as an exempt agency in the Second Schedule.  For the most part, the bodies listed in the Second Schedule are commercial entities, have little or no interaction with the general public or are major sectoral regulatory authorities such as ComReg, as I mentioned.  The Ombudsman is precluded from investigating an action taken by or on behalf of a body specified in the Second Schedule or those specified in Part II of the First Schedule regarding those elements which are excluded.<\/p><p> I mentioned An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  The reason it is exempt is that has its own ombudsman.<\/p><p> One of the points I have taken on board is the need to stop the proliferation of the use of the term &quot;ombudsman&quot; because there are now so many persons who call themselves &quot;ombudsman&quot;.  That will not be allowed in the future, although there are a number of such persons.  I knew somebody who used the terms &quot;ombudsman&quot; and &quot;ombudswoman&quot;, but I do not know whether that is extreme.<\/p><p> Deputy Mary Lou McDonald is proposing amendments to amendments Nos. 25 and 26 which I will deal with when she has had a chance to make her contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300032#EE00100","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351014600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>As there are many amendments being discussed together, perhaps it would make more sense to start with amendments Nos. 25 and 26 and work backwards.<\/p><p>  On amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 25, there are some who argue coherently that any body which is fully funded or in receipt of substantial public funds should not be exempt from the gaze of the &quot;Ombudswoman&quot; or &quot;Ombudsman&quot;.  If one thinks about the purpose of an ombudsman, that logically makes a good deal of sense.  If the purpose is to ensure transparency, fairness, good procedures, good decision-making and, above all, accountability, the logical position that should be adopted is that everybody should be included and that there should be no specific exemptions.  In the course of the debate in the Seanad, for instance, colleagues from my party but also Senator Se\u00e1n D. Barrett argued this point forcefully, logically and convincingly.  However, that is not where I am coming from on this issue.  My main concern is the decision that has been made to exclude the Department of Justice and Equality, in so far as it relates to an action taken in the administration of the law relating to immigration or naturalisation and in the administration of the prisons and other places of detention for persons committed to custody by the courts.

It writes large the reason, above all else, examination of this area should not be exempt from the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  I hear what the Minister is saying about an alternative procedure, but let me put it to him in these terms.  The experience and observations of the Irish Prison Service have been so damning for so many years and there have been so many negative experiences, including, for instance, the damning account of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, of her interaction with the prison authority and staff in St. Patrick's Institution, that if ever there was a case for an institution coming within the ambit of the Ombudsman, it would be that of prisons and places of detention.  I hear what the Minister is saying about flexibility within the legislation, that if he were so minded to extend its scope, he would not have to amend the primary legislation, etc., but I want him to go one better and from the get-go include these institutions, in particular, in the legislation.  The Ombudsman and her predecessors have been clear on the importance of these elements of justice falling within the remit of the ombudsman.  They have made this point consistently and have not resiled from that position.  Our experience of places of detention should inform us that this is the sensible way to proceed.<\/p><p>  The Minister's faith in his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, may be admirable, but it is misplaced.  This legislation and these reform and accountability mechanisms fall fairly and squarely within the Minister's remit.  It is his responsibility to bring them home.  He should not wait for a ministerial colleague to do right or introduce processes not yet clearly defined to deal with these matters.  I said so to him when we debated the matter at Question Time.  What are we hiding from and what are we running away from?  It seems logical that the Ombudsman should have an oversight role in respect of justice matters, particularly in places of detention.  I, therefore, intend to press the matter to a vote.  For me, the biggest flaw in this legislation is that the Minister has not taken the necessary step by including that element.<\/p><p>  Working backwards, I see the good sense in some of the Minister's amendments.  He has given his rationale for amendment No. 12.  Amendment No. 10 concerns exempted agencies.  I could argue the fine detail of the precise definition of exempted agencies, etc., but my much bigger concern, as I said to the Minister previously, is that the elements of the Department Justice and Equality mentioned be included.  It is welcome that the Minister has built in a mitigating measure, that, if it comes to it, he can extend the remit to capture these matters, but I press him once again to do so at this juncture rather than to kick the can down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300033#FF00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1351014600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>There are two points the Minister might be able to clarify for me on this group of amendments.  Amendment No. 25 states, &quot;Part I of this Schedule does not include a reference to...&quot;.  Under paragraph (<i>k<\/i>) the Minister is including the words, &quot;a local authority (within the meaning of the Local Government Act 2001), insofar as it relates to the performance of reserved functions within the meaning of that Act...&quot;.  I understand the reason but I want to tease it out with the Minister.  As I read it, the Ombudsman will not have a role where the elected members of a local authority are operating in the performance of their reserved functions.  These functions, as we all will be aware, include consideration of the annual estimates and the striking of the rate.  One of their biggest reserve functions involves the passing of development plans and it is to that issue that I wish to specifically refer.  It is one at which the Minister should look again.  I will not oppose the legislation on these grounds, but I am aware that there are other issues involved.  When the legislation beds down, during the lifetime of the Government I expect that the Minister will look again at it and I ask him to be conscious of this matter at that stage. I understand why this provision is included in the Bill.  It is because it is deemed to be a democratic function performed by elected representatives, which is fine.  I understand that is the main reason people would be happy with this provision.  However, I ask the Minister to look at it in a broader sense.  I refer to an instance where local authority members pass a development plan.  This matter did not come up for discussion to a great extent in the context of the reform of local government, apart from the power of elected members to direct the county manager to perform a particular function.<\/p><p>This is often referred to as a section 4 motion and I believe the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is going to remove this power, rightly so.  Any councillor will testify that when one is being plagued by members of the public to sign a section 4 motion, one is in hot water before one even starts.  In that context, one is better off not having to go down that route.  That is one of the reserved functions covered under the Bill which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will abolish in due course.  <\/p><p> I have some concerns about one of the reserved functions that elected members will retain, namely, that concerning the passing of a development plan.  I will give an example to illustrate my concerns.  Recently Laois County Council adopted its development plan; it was one of the first local authorities to do so under the new regime.   A contentious issue arose concerning EirGrid pylons in the county and the elected members, having listened to the views of residents and taken stock of the cost implications of laying cables underground, as opposed to running them above ground, included a section which allowed for certain cables to be placed underground.  The advice from the county manager and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government went against this and EirGrid which was not happy sought a judicial review in the High Court of the decision made by the local authority and its members.  The High Court directed that the relevant section in the development plan which had been voted on specifically by the elected members be removed.  Where elected members take an action with which other parties disagree, the only option open to these parties is to seek a judicial review in the High Court.  In the example I gave that is what happened.  I am not saying which side I am on, but I am merely illustrating a point.  The aggrieved party won, the members' decision was overturned and the section was deleted from the development plan.  All of this happened within the last 12 months.  <\/p><p> It is unfair that the only avenue open to citizens if they are not happy with a decision of elected members of a local authority is to seek a judicial review.  EirGrid which is financed by the taxpayer has immensely deep pockets and could have fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.  Ordinary citizens, on the other hand, do not have such resources and it is unfair that the only mechanism available to them is to seek a judicial review, which costs tens of thousands of euro.  There should be a mechanism in place, whereby they can appeal such decisions to the Ombudsman, the elected members can explain their decision in a forum that is not costly to the citizen and the Ombudsman can make a decision on the case.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue at the next available opportunity.<\/p><p> I refer to another part of the Schedule, namely, paragraph <i>(p)<\/i>which refers to &quot;the Private Residential Tenancies Board, except as it relates to an action taken in the performance of administrative functions under Part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.&quot;  I ask the Minister to explain precisely what &quot;administrative functions under Part 7&quot; means, if he has a note to hand.  He may not have the information available, but if he does, I ask him to provide it for the House.  A lot of people, both landlords and tenants, are very unhappy with the operation of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  I do not agree that the only matters that can be dealt with are its administrative functions but rather that all of its functions should be within the remit of the Ombudsman.  I ask the Minister to consider this at some point.<\/p><p> I wish to comment on the amendment Deputy Mary Lou McDonald has tabled, specifically the section on the administration of the law relating to immigration and naturalisation, but before doing so, I will be supporting the legislation as passed by the Seanad.  People may ask why and now that it appears we will be voting on this amendment, I wish to explain my position.  I am speaking again, as I often do in this House, from my practical experience as a Deputy.  There were two asylum centres in County Laois, but the smaller one has now closed.  I have dealt with a lot of asylum applicants and must say up front that the asylum process is long and dragged out such that it defies all justice.  It does not do justice to the countries from whence the applicants come and if they have a genuine case, they are being denied justice by the process followed.  <\/p><p> Every time an asylum seeker receives a letter from the Department of Justice and Equality with which he or she is unhappy, he or she is entitled to seek a judicial review.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald might fundamentally disagree with me, but that is my experience.  A letter stating asylum is not being granted is met with a judicial review which can take a few years to complete.  A review takes place, the decision is upheld and the applicant lodges an appeal.  A letter stating the appeal has not been upheld is again greeted with a judicial review.  When that review process is exhausted and the applicant is told that he or she must leave the State, another judicial review is initiated.  Sometimes there can be three or more judicial reviews as part of the process and the applicant can go to the main courts and, if unsuccessful, take a case to the European court.  Some of these cases are genuine, but I do not believe that involving the Ombudsman in this process is wise.  For a start, I do not know at what point the Ombudsman could get involved.  Does she wait until a decision has been made by the European Court of Justice?  Under current arrangements, after the initial decision on an asylum application is made, there is always a right to appeal, but a fundamental point about the Ombudsman's office is that it insists on all avenues of appeal being exhausted before it becomes involved in a case.  The appeals process is not exhausted as long as judicial reviews are ongoing and the Ombudsman could always say the office is not getting involved because of the possibility of a further judicial review taking place at some point.  Therefore, technically, the Ombudsman could not get involved until after the European Court of Justice has made a decision because until that time, the Department of Justice and Equality is not finished with the case.  I sympathise with Deputy Mary Lou McDonald in her concern for those who are having difficulties with the process, but I do not know when, legally, the Ombudsman could get involved in an asylum application case.  The Ombudsman might end up being another stalling mechanism.<\/p><p> Paragraph <i>(f), <\/i>subparagraph (ii) refers to &quot;the administration of the prisons or other places for the custody of persons committed to custody by the courts&quot;.  We were all moved by the report from the Inspector of Prisons last week on St. Patrick's Institution and what had happened there to children between the ages of 16 and 18 years.  That report made for very grim and harsh reading and was alarming in that it did not catalogue events in the past but current practices in Ireland by State bodies.  It brought to mind the fact that only one year ago the HSE could not tell the Committee of Public Accounts how many children had died in its care.  It was not asked about deaths that had occurred 20 or 30 years ago but only since the HSE was established, within the past decade.  The executive had never produced a report on the death of a child in its care and did not know how many such deaths had occurred.  The neglect of children by State agencies and what we have seen in St. Patrick's Institution recently make the upcoming referendum all the more important.  I ask the Minister to ensure that if the referendum is passed on 10 November, the Government will increase the budget for child protection measures next year.  The public will be very cross if they vote 'Yes' to ensure the protection of children and then find that their wishes have not been backed up by the provision of additional resources.  <\/p><p> Personally, I have full confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, surprising though that may sound to some.  I met him last week and complimented him on his swift and strong action with regard to the report on St. Patrick's Institution.  Several years ago he published reports on children who had died in the care of the HSE.  He has form when it comes to looking after the welfare of children.  In that context, I am prepared to give him the opportunity to come forward with appropriate legislation.  The Ombudsman is not overly concerned about who is overseeing the institution, once there is a proper regime in place.  The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, is also involved in the area of child protection and it would not make sense to have a possible duplication of functions between her office and that of the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>People will ask why we voted in a particular way if the amendment proceeds to a division.  My party is satisfied with what is contained in the Bill, but if the provisions do not operate as intended, we will be seeking new legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300033#FF00500","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351015800,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies opposite for the cogent cases they have made which I will address <i>seriatim<\/i>.  <\/p><p>  On the exclusion of the Irish Prison Service, the Minister for Justice and Equality has confirmed his intention to introduce a new and credible prisoner complaints system which will deal with complaints in an open, transparent and independent way.  Robust new procedures will be implemented, with priority given to complaints which give rise to most concern, including allegations of mistreatment, the use of excessive force, racial discrimination, intimidation and threats.  Such complaints will be examined by investigators from outside the Irish Prison Service.  The service has already recruited a panel of 22 external investigators who will undergo appropriate training this month and the new procedures for dealing with the most serious complaints will go live from 1 November.  <\/p><p>  I share the concerns expressed by the Deputies about the recent report on St. Patrick's Institution.  The Government will not tolerate the abuses disclosed in that institution.  That the matters arising have been brought to light is testament to the robustness of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  We want to give oversight statutory underpinning, with a team of independent investigators.  I ask Deputies to allow this to happen without interposing another body until we see how the new regime beds down.  We do not want to have two State bodies doing the same thing at the same time in calling for the same papers, investigating the same matters, calling the same witnesses and, perhaps, coming to different conclusions.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality has made clear his intention to establish a complaints system in a statutory framework.  I have spoken to him directly about the matter and his Department is working on legislation which will be brought to the House at the earliest opportunity.  Under his plans, a report will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas not more than three months after it is submitted by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  It is clear that the inspectorate is doing an excellent job.  If there are concerns that the new regime is not sufficiently robust, I expect the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions will respond on the basis of its responsibility for the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman will report to that committee and I am sure she will express her opinion on such matters.  I have pledged in the Seanad that I will consider the committee's views, alongside those expressed by the Ombudsman and the relevant Minister, on extending the Ombudsman's remit to include this area.  That is a reasonable perspective to take at this stage and I welcome the support offered by Deputy Sean Fleming in this regard.<\/p><p>  In regard to the immigration, refugee and naturalisation agencies, the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce comprehensive reforms to Ireland's immigration, residency and asylum system, including having a statutory appeals system that is transparent to all immigrants and asylum seekers. The intention is to provide for the efficient processing and determination of citizenship applications within a reasonable period of time.  The reforms will be placed on a statutory footing through immigration, residence and protection legislation.  Deputies will be aware of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.  Following the development of key Government amendments, the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to return the Bill to the Oireachtas as comprehensive new legislation which will be the centrepiece of a major programme of reform in the area of immigration.  His objective is to be in a position to bring the new Bill to the Government for approval and publication this year in order that it can be enacted as soon as possible thereafter as the Houses permit.  In view of his intention to embark on such an extensive programme of reform, the Government has decided that it would be inappropriate at this stage to introduce a review mechanism or bring this area under the purview of the Ombudsman.  We need to allow the system to bed down in order that we can identify what we need to review.  I hope the Deputies opposite will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt in that regard.<\/p><p>  In response to the questions raised by Deputy Sean Fleming, I have determined that the reserved functions of local authorities should continue to be excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman.  Complaints about local authorities comprise a substantial proportion of the Ombudsman's work, but an issue arises in respect of reserved functions, that is, the exercise of viewpoints by elected representatives.  Should we establish a system to second guess the right of an elected member to vote for or against a development plan?  If corruption occurred, it would be a matter for the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to investigate.  In the exercise of their democratic right, local authority members should be free agents in the same way as the Constitution provides that the Members of this House can exercise their democratic authority.  Deputy Sean Fleming is correct to note that all such actions are subject to judicial review, but the courts would not look behind the decisions themselves.  All that is considered is whether proper procedures and constitutional norms on appropriateness and fairness were observed.  If the High Court found a procedure to be arbitrary, improper or not in accordance with law, it obviously would have something to say about it.  <\/p><p>  The Private Residential Tenancies Board operates a national tenancy registration system, resolves disputes between landlords and tenants and provides policy advice for the Government on the private rented sector.  The PRTB's dispute resolution service replaces the courts in the majority of landlord tenant disputes.  It is being brought within the remit of the Ombudsman in so far as the administrative aspects of its functions are concerned.  Deputy Sean Fleming specifically asked about Part 7 which lists its functions.  I will have a copy of Part 7 supplied to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300035#HH00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1351015800,"counter":538,"content":"<p>On local government, I understand elected members are entitled to make their own decisions.

Also, there have been six or seven instances where the Minister has issued a directive to local authorities to amend their development plans.  In a previous Oireachtas this happened.  It was a blunt instrument in that the then Minister issued a directive out of the blue, without consultation.  Now, following legislation introduced by the previous Government, there is a more discursive process.  The Minister can issue his views and intentions and hear the views and submissions of others and, perhaps, revise his directive.  There is an option for him to second guess the council members if he chooses and an option for the courts to second guess them.  The Minister believes this is a narrow point of view with regard to procedures, but the people concerned can look more widely in considering whether the development plan is in accordance with regional plans and the national spatial strategy.  I will not push the issue, but there is a little more to it than the simple point made.

It is a well known fact that boats pull up alongside each other in the middle of the night and that the necessary resources are not available to police such activity.  Anything could be changing hands when this is happening.<\/p><p>I do not intend to belittle it but it could be something as straightforward as illegal cigarettes changing hands from one boat to another or it could be something as horrifying as people who have been abducted in one country being brought to another country under the cover of darkness.  I support any measure that will help to fight organised criminals.<\/p><p> I thank the people who work in the Irish media who expose organised criminal gangs and in so doing put themselves in danger.  A number of newspapers put much time and resources into crime coverage and but for their efforts, criminals would have a much freer hand.  I compliment the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na on its excellent work, especially since they are dealing with a completely different type of criminal to those who were operating ten or 20 years ago.  The criminals have considerable resources available to them and they are highly organised.  They use all types of modern technology to try to evade detection and arrest.  I will support the Minister for Justice and Equality in any way to ensure that we win the fight against organised crime.  It is important to employ proper resources on the streets and in coastal areas at night to tackle highly illegal activity.  It is difficult to police coastlines.  I compliment the work that has been done in bringing the Bill before the House.  I thank the Minister and support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300038#LL01100","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351017600,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Criminal intelligence analysis has been recognised by law enforcement as a useful tool for more than 25 years.  It is successfully used within the international community.  While there are many definitions of criminal intelligence analysis in use throughout the world, the definition agreed in June 1992 by a group of 12 European member states and Interpol, which was subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows: the identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.<\/p><p>  Europol is the European Union\u2019s criminal intelligence agency.  It was established in 1995 under the Europol convention.  However, owing to difficulties with amending conventions which require lengthy ratification by member states it was agreed to replace the convention with an EU Council decision.  The primary purpose of the Europol Bill 2012 is to give effect to the 2009 EU Council decision establishing Europol.<\/p><p>  In 2008 the Houses of the Oireachtas approved the adoption by the State of the Council decision.  The previous convention was given force of law in the State through the Europol Act 1997.  When the Bill is enacted it will repeal and replace the Act.  Unlike a convention however, a Council decision requires that each and every aspect of the instrument with a domestic impact must be provided for in legislation.  For that reason the Bill is significantly more detailed than the Europol Act 1997.<\/p><p>  Europol\u2019s activities could be broadly categories as information management on the one hand and semi-operational tasks on the other.  Europol interacts with member states through national units within each state where it has been established.  The national unit in this country is within An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  While incorporating the provisions of the convention and its protocols the Council decision also introduces some new features to Europol.  They include an extension to Europol\u2019s mandate.  Organised crime was originally the sole focus of Europol\u2019s activities.  The Council decision largely reflects the provisions of the convention.  However, it removes the requirement that an organised criminal structure must be involved before Europol can act.  It will now be sufficient for the crime concerned to be a serious offence involving two or more member states.  These offences include the main transnational crimes such as drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering and also include murder and kidnapping.<\/p><p>  Two months ago in my constituency the drug-related killing of Alan Ryan took place in Clongriffin.  The cold-blooded killing was carried out in broad daylight in front of young children who are still traumatised by what they saw.  I welcome the changes to the structure of Europol that will make it easier for the organisation to take action against serious crime within the European Union such as drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, murder and kidnapping.  We are all aware that such crimes are becoming more prominent in society and must be tackled.  In the Irish context we have seen in the past decade how Irish drug lords are running their operations from Spain and the Netherlands.  We have also seen how subversive organisations have attempted to smuggle weapons into the European Union.  The Bill will help law enforcement agencies to gather intelligence on such activities and to work together to break down criminal and subversive organisations across the borders of EU member states, which will save lives and ensure the well-being of EU citizens in this country and elsewhere.  I support the Bill and commend the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300039#MM00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1351017600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Europol Bill 2012 which will enable this country to implement an EU Council decision establishing the European Police Office.  The objective of Europol is to improve effectiveness and co\u00adoperation of the law enforcement authorities of member states in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting member states.<\/p><p>  As a Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, cross-Border co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is something I wholeheartedly support and encourage.  It is an area on which we must expand further.  Only last week, I attended a special meeting of Clones Town Council to discuss dangerous driving practices, including diffing and donuting, on the A3-N54 Clones to Cavan road.  This has been a long-running issue in the area and a number of constituents have contacted me to outline their concerns.  I wish to quote from a letter received from one constituent which clearly outlines the problem:<blockquote>On Sunday 6th March 2011 at approximately 5 p.m., my daughter was travelling back to her home in Portarlington when on the Clones\/Cavan concession road, a car (with lots of spectators) did a 'doughnut' in the middle of the road as she was driving along.  It was touch and go to being a tragedy which left her shaken and scared.<\/blockquote>That is typical of what happens on the road currently.  I received the letter in March 2011 but unfortunately the problem still persists and it is clear that action must be taken or a fatality is inevitable.  The problem lies in the fact that the road in question crosses the Border at a number of points between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  While I commend members of the PSNI and An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, whom I know are doing their utmost to police the area as effectively as possible, unfortunately, due to the legal restrictions involved, neither force has the authority to enter the opposing jurisdiction to make an arrest.  That is proving to be a major problem in apprehending those responsible.  I previously raised the matter with the chief superintendent of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in Monaghan and I also met with the chief inspector of the PSNI in Fermanagh to discuss the matter.  Following those discussions, it was clear that in order for the problem to be properly addressed that further powers must be extended to the PSNI and An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.<\/p><p>  I previously raised the issue with the Minister and suggested that the Schengen Agreement could be examined as a means to resolving the situation.  Under the Schengen Agreement, police forces in a number of EU countries have the right to chase suspected criminals across borders.  The Minister previously advised that in their applications to participate in the Schengen Agreement, neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom will sign up to Article 41, which provides for hot pursuit across international borders.  I appreciate that in order for the approach to be effective both this country and the UK would have to opt in and in that regard, I urge the Minister to pursue the matter seriously with his counterpart in the UK.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to be a member of the recently established North-South Inter-Pparliamentary Association, which represents further progress in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and provides a unique opportunity for politicians from north and south of the Border to maximise co-operation for the benefit of the people we represent.<\/p><p>I believe this should be the same for our respective police forces.  Diesel laundering is another major problem in the Border region and this could also be addressed more comprehensively by allowing the PSNI or the Garda to enter either jurisdiction and make an arrest.<\/p><p> Europol is the perfect example of how joined-up thinking and co\u00adoperation between member states can work to prevent and combat crime.  To date, substantial work has been carried out in the areas of organised crime, illegal immigration and prostitution.  We should take this positive framework and further build upon it at national level in terms of cross-Border policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300039#MM00300","speaker":"973","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351018200,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I am very happy to speak on this Bill.  Europol has been in existence since 1995 and over the years has done very valuable work in tackling cross-Border crime.  Until now its existence was based on an EU convention which has been subject to many amendments and subsequent protocols that in turn were subject to lengthy ratification procedures by member states.  As a result, it was decided to replace these instruments with a European Council decision which will ease any future amendments.<\/p><p>  This Bill is significantly more detailed than the existing Europol Act in that every aspect which has a domestic effect must be provided for in this legislation.  It is important to note that, under the convention, Europol had the status of an intergovernmental organisation and was funded from contributions from member states.  The establishment of Europol under a Council decision gives it the status of an agency of the European Union.  In consequence, it will be funded from the general budget of the European Union.<\/p><p>  There are various types of criminals who have high levels of sophistication.  These criminals are developing new techniques, use modern technology and up-to-date communications.  This makes it imperative that Europol can be flexible in its approach as a crime-fighting organisation.  Changes to keep up with the criminal world need to be made as simply and as quickly as possible.  The core objective of Europol under the Council's decision is to improve the effectiveness and co-operation of law enforcement authorities of member states.  The focus is on preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and any other forms of serious crime that affect two or more member states.  Originally, organised crime was the sole focus of Europol's activities.  From now on it will be sufficient for the crime concerned to involve a serious offence such as unlawful drug trafficking, money laundering, illegal immigrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, illicit trade in human organs, racketeering and extortion, computer crime, and many other criminal activities.<\/p><p>  The Europol police force is mainly made up of officers seconded from national agencies.  An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the PSNI, as well as officers from Revenue and Customs and Excise, work together and with others across Europe to combat crime and in co-operation with police and law enforcement agencies throughout the world.  Crime and crime bosses do not recognise borders, as the Minister pointed out.  No member state, including Ireland, can avoid the impact of international crime.  The very nature of this crime requires the co-operation of several states to ensure an effective response.<\/p><p>  Europol provides very necessary support and co-ordination to national law enforcement agencies, and this helps to make Europe a more secure and safer place for all its citizens.  Some citizens may have concerns about the accumulation of personal data on a Europe-wide basis.  It must be noted that data under the Act are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts.  This Council decision formally puts in place data protection officer and also guarantees the independent nature of this officer's role.  In addition, section 13 of the Bill provides for access by individuals to personal data.  This will ensure that any data held by Europol can be examined by a citizen to ensure that they are fair and accurate.<\/p><p>  This Bill will strengthen Europol in combating crimes that increasingly move across borders.  Without Europol, combating such crimes would be almost impossible.  I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300040#NN00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1351018200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who spoke and for the support they expressed for this Bill.  The legislation is substantially supported on both sides of the House by a variety of Members.  In particular, I thank Members of the Government parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, for their support.<\/p><p>  I am still somewhat confused by the contribution made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn of Sinn F\u00e9in who seemed to stand out from everyone else in his contribution.  I am not entirely sure whether he opposes the Bill or opposes Europol, whether he disagrees only with aspects of this Bill or whether it is aspects of the provisions adopted at European level that relate to Europol with which he disagrees  The best I can say is that he believes something should be done about crime but he has a mental reservation as to whether he can support the mechanisms provided in this legislation and the entire supportive framework Europol provides to members states, including this one.<\/p><p>  It is no harm to remember the central objective of the Bill in the context of the contribution Europol makes.  I refer to the Schedule of the Bill which provides the detail of the Council decision in Article 3: &quot;The objective of Europol shall be to support and strengthen action by the competent authorities of the Member States and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member States.&quot;<\/p><p>  The Council decision further details in Article 5 the various tasks of Europol, including principal tasks, which in effect are the collecting, storing, processing, analysis and exchange of information and intelligence; notifying the competent authorities of the member states - in our case the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na - without delay of information concerning intelligence and about any connections identified between criminal offences; aiding investigations in member states, in particular by forwarding relevant information to the national units - ours again being the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na; asking competent authorities in member states to initiate, conduct or co-ordinate investigations and to suggest the setting up of joint investigation teams in specific cases; to provide intelligence and analytical support to member states in connection with major international events; and to prepare threat assessments, strategic analyses and general situation reports relating to objectives, including organised crime threat assessments.<\/p><p>  These are all objectives that should be supported by Members of this House, along with the setting up of joint investigation teams in specific cases involving organised crimes that impact on two or more member states.  This is an obvious commonsensical measure to which, for some reason, Deputy Mac Lochlainn announced his opposition.  This is important legislation.  Europol plays a very important role.  There is accountability within the provisions relating to Europol with regard to the manner in which it conducts its affairs in the context of its funding and its operations in so far as the European Parliament has given it an expanded role under this Council decision.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome the support for the Bill.  I listened with interest to various issues, some of a technical nature, that were raised by Deputies and I look forward to addressing those in some detail on Committee Stage.  It would not be appropriate to go into some of the details now.<\/p><p>  Again, I thank Members of the House for their contributions.  Some strayed beyond the Bill before the House but understandably they addressed issues of law enforcement and criminality that are of concern to them as Members in this State.  In the context of what was said, I assure Members that the Garda and the work it is doing have the full support of me, as Minister, and of the Government<\/p><p>  I know many Deputies will welcome that we found savings of \u20ac3 million which has facilitated the purchase of 170 new Garda cars before the end of this year.

I also wish to thank my colleagues in Fianna F\u00e1il for allowing our Private Members' time for this week to be used to highlight the issue of the threat posed to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, throughout the country by the plans of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to introduce a very unnecessary statutory sick pay scheme.  The Government's amendment to the motion refers to the fact that a consultation process is still under way and that a final decision has yet to be made.  It also highlights all the Government believes it is doing in the interests of small business.  As on previous occasions, I welcome the introduction - at long last - of the credit guarantee scheme.  I do not doubt that the action plan on jobs will be mentioned more often during this debate than the name of Santa Claus at Christmas.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that the Minister, Deputy Burton, has form when it comes to attacking and undermining the SME sector.  Last year she reduced the redundancy rebate from 60% to 15%.  The Government indicated that this measure was taken specifically so that the taxpayer would not be obliged to pay for the redundancies of large employers who were moving to lower-cost locations and that there would be minimal impact on SMEs.  That is a laudable aim.  However, when I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister in respect of the breakdown of companies which employ fewer than 50 and which had received redundancy rebates in the previous 24 months, she replied that information in this regard is not available within her Department.  How is it possible to state that a proposal will not impact on a sector when the most basic of information is not to hand in one's Department?  We now have an idea of the impact this proposal has had.<\/p><p>  A survey of 500 businesses carried out by Chambers Ireland and published earlier this month shows that 60.7% of respondents said the cut in redundancy rebate has had a negative impact on their business; 40.7% said it had made them less likely to employ new staff and 18.1% said it had limited their business's ability to survive.  I am putting the Minister of State, who has responsibility for small business, and the Government on notice that a second &quot;Burton burden&quot; must not be placed on small businesses.  This evening we are beginning our campaign to inform such businesses about this oncoming threat.  They must be aware that &quot;Hurricane Joan&quot; is back in town.  We encourage small businesses to act and to lobby Government Deputies, in particular, in order to protect their capacity to grow, to employ more people and, in many cases, to remain in operation.  I assure those on the Government benches that this campaign will not end with tomorrow night's vote.<\/p><p>  Nobody is denying that we need a properly thought-out debate on workplace absenteeism in Ireland and all of the causes and effects relating thereto.  However, forcing businesses to pay for the lack of a proper debate is completely unacceptable.  Let us reflect on the research available in respect of the current position.  The 2011 IBEC guide to managing absence, which is based on data provided by 635 companies which employ in excess of 110,000 people, found that employees missed 5.98 days on average, an absence rate of 2.6%, compared to 3.4% in the last comprehensive survey in 2004; and that absence levels were higher in large organisations, 3.6% for companies with over 500 employees, versus 2.2% for companies with fewer than 50.  According to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - in evidence given to the Committee of Public accounts last December - the rate of absence in the Civil Service is 4.9%, an average of 11.3 days a year.  This cost the State between &#8364;400 million and &#8364;500 million in terms of pay.  Similar absence levels are reported by local authorities, the HSE and other bodies.  When asked about this matter in the D\u00e1il on 22 February last, the Taoiseach stated, &quot;There is little absenteeism in the small and medium enterprise sector and persons who are ill are genuinely out sick&quot;.  He can, therefore, vouch for the bona fides of the SME sector.<\/p><p>  At present, there is no legal obligation on employers to pay sick pay for their employees.  If someone is sick for more than three days, he or she can claim from the Department of Social Protection.  However, IBEC figures suggest that 60% of employers have voluntarily put sick pay schemes into operation.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has claimed that the system under which the State pays for most employee sickness is different from those which obtain in the majority of other countries.  She plans to make employers pay staff for the first four weeks for which they are out sick.  However, she has not acknowledged that employers already pay billions in PRSI to cover the cost of many things, including sick leave.  In 2010, employers paid &#8364;5 billion - or 75% of the total - in contributions to the social insurance fund.  As already stated, this covers sick pay benefits.  If, therefore, we proceed with the Minister's proposal, will employers be obliged to pay on the double?<\/p><p>  The international comparisons the Minister uses in respect of this matter do not recognise that there is no cap on the employers' PRSI rate in this country - which currently stands at 10.75% - or that, unlike the United Kingdom, for example, the rate applies to all income.  While some OECD countries have statutory sick pay schemes to which employers contribute, some do not.  OECD countries where, in the main, statutory sick pay is not paid by employers include Canada, Greece, Portugal, Turkey, the United States and, except under certain collective agreements, Denmark.  These are our competitor nations and they have markets into which we are seeking to trade.  We should take note of the arrangements which exist in these countries.<\/p><p>  As the amendment to the motion indicates, in February the Minister commenced a consultation process regarding the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme under which employers will share the cost.  She suggests that the annual saving to the Exchequer of such introducing such a scheme could be &#8364;23 million, if the employer paid for the first week, or &#8364;89 million, if the employer paid for the first four weeks.  However, the Minister does not appear to be concerned with regard to from where that &#8364;23 million or &#8364;89 million will come.  I can be of some assistance to her in this regard.  For 40% of employers - mainly smaller employers who currently do not have formal sick pay schemes in place - what is envisaged will give rise to a new and substantial additional cost.  This new cost burden will be a tax on jobs and will have most effect on smaller, more vulnerable employers who operate low-margin businesses.  These employers operate in the domestic economy - in the services and retail sectors - and are among those worst affected by the crisis affecting business.  The 2010 Forf\u00e1s report, Costs of Doing Business in Ireland, showed that for the sectors to which I refer, labour already accounts for approximately 60% of domestic input costs, while for the services sector as a whole, labour costs account for 84% of location-sensitive costs and must be reduced.  In the report to which I refer, the Government's own economic agency is telling it something.<\/p><p>  For the majority of employers with sick pay schemes in place, the additional cost implication of each week's sick pay could be &#8364;188 - based on the current social welfare flat rate - per person.  This would be on top of the current high-cost burden of existing company sick pay schemes.  Many of these employers would be obliged to further realign their existing schemes in order to cover this additional cost.  This will open up entire schemes to negotiation and give rise to difficulties within companies.<\/p><p>  We know that a minimum of one in four companies has reduced basic pay since 2008.  In the current year, some 74% of IBEC members will either freeze or reduce basic pay.  As this is happening, we are imposing a statutory sick pay scheme higher PRSI charges on these employers and obliging them to pay the wages or any replacement workers.  Furthermore, we must consider the high administrative costs that will arise.  In its amendment, the Government praises itself on the work it is doing to reduce the administrative burden of small businesses and again commits itself to achieving the 25% target in this regard.  If a statutory sick pay scheme is introduced, the Government will impose a whole new burden of administration on the businesses in question.  It is acknowledged that the statutory sick pay scheme which obtains in the UK places an enormous burden on small businesses in particular.<\/p><p>  We must consider the potential impact the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme here could have on employment levels.  We are all about the creation of new jobs and the maintenance of existing employment.  A major survey carried out among over 2,000 SMEs throughout the country was published in recent days.  This survey was carried out by ISME on behalf of the local business alliance, which represents 30,000 businesses which employ 400,000 people and which is composed of members of RGDATA and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, vintners, hoteliers and companies which employ people locally.  Those businesses to which I refer have kept going despite the huge adversity with which they must deal.<\/p><p> Research by ISME and the Local Business Alliance survey show that this potential Burton burden will have a disastrous impact on competitiveness and jobs and that it will lead to an increase in absenteeism levels in the small and medium business sector.  The survey confirms that if the proposals are introduced, 96% of companies surveyed anticipate job losses; 94% of companies outlined that their cost base would increase; 94% feel that absenteeism levels will increase with only 1% expecting a reduction.  Another group which has done research in this area is Early Childhood Ireland which represents 3,330 child care professionals supporting more than 100,000 children.  Its survey found that almost four out of ten child care providers would have to cut staff numbers if the sick pay proposal was introduced while 42% said they would increase their fees.  Therefore, those on the lowest incomes who depend on child care will be faced with a cost increase or a reduction in service and this will present difficulties and challenges for small employers and for the social welfare budget.  This is the word from the coalface if the Minister proceeds with her plan.  That is why we cannot allow the plan to proceed.<\/p><p> I expect to hear a lot about the action plan for jobs. I will begin the process.  One of the comments in the jobs plan is:<blockquote>Cost competitiveness is one of the key determinants of every firm's success.  Notwithstanding the cost competitiveness gains made since 2008, a range of business inputs remain relatively expensive compared to other jurisdictions.<\/blockquote>Referring to manufacturing the plan states: &quot;Specific challenges facing manufacturing in Ireland include: reducing costs of production in Ireland including costs of labour.&quot;  With reference to the tourism industry the plan states: &quot;Costs remain high relative to competitors - a structural change to the costs of doing business in Ireland is essential - of particular concern are labour, waste and energy costs and local authority charges.&quot;<\/p><p> The Government amendment to the motion refers to those cost reductions in those sectors.  However, the Minister of State will know that such reductions are not happening.  As we continue to cosset our energy sector and the State-controlled energy sector, we are not seeing cost reductions.  This is another cost completely outside of the control of employers.  Our labour costs are too high relative to our competitors yet the Minister proposes to increase those costs.<\/p><p> I note some voices of reason within the Government.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has said that &quot;proposals for a statutory sick pay scheme would impact on competitiveness and employment.  The evidence of this impact will need to be weighed against the potential for savings in terms of reduced absence due to sickness&quot;.  We have provided evidence from more than 2,000 employers of increased absence, increased costs and very little savings.  I call on the Ministers to publish the Forf\u00e1s report which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, commissioned on the matter in November of last year.  I understand it details the potential impact on jobs and competitiveness in the economy and the direct impact on companies to proposals on sick pay from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.<\/p><p> The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, is of a similar view.  He heads another Department in a very job-sensitive area.  He said on Newstalk radio on 22 February that:<blockquote>Many small businesses across the country would struggle to afford to be able to pay a significant sick pay bill.  Before we would agree to make any changes in this area we would want to think about it very carefully in terms of its impact on employment.  That is why it wasn't introduced in the last budget even though some people were strongly arguing for it, including Joan Burton.<\/blockquote>This is a Cabinet colleague of the Minister's saying she is committed to the introduction of the scheme.  This makes a mockery of the consultation process.  <\/p><p> I suggest the Minister, Deputy Burton, should listen to voices within her own party.  Senator John Whelan warned that such measures could push many small and medium enterprises &quot;over the edge&quot;.  He cited Deputy Burton's recent comments to the effect that middle Ireland could not take more financial pain and said: &quot;I do hope that Joan Burton keeps her comments in mind when it comes to any changes within the whole area of employers' PRSI or within the whole area of sick leave in the private sector.&quot;<\/p><p> I do not doubt that any Member will break ranks on the vote tomorrow night.  However, from reading regional newspapers and Fine Gael press office statements I know that many Members will echo the views of the Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Coveney, and Senator Whelan.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, however, does not have a good record and she is not a good listener when it comes to the pressures facing small business employers and their businesses.  <\/p><p> Fianna F\u00e1il will not give up on this issue.  Tonight is merely the start of a concerted campaign on this issue to show the damage it will do to our economy, to employment and to an already fragile SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300041#OO00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351019400,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on this subject and I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is here this evening because I am sure that in his heart and soul, he knows that this is completely misguided.  Having worked for years creating employment, I always argue that reduction in costs done in a painless, non-bureaucratic way, is more important than getting grants.  The awarding of a grant involves applications and delays.  However, if some initiative was able to cut the basic cost of employing people, there was an immediate saving with no added bureaucracy.<\/p><p>  When this Government came into office it was going to have a great jobs budget.  Of course, it turned out to be a damp squib of a jobs initiative.  Since then, when the unemployment figures and the outward migration figures are factored in, this Government has failed abysmally to create jobs.  <\/p><p>  I do not believe that governments directly create jobs because in the reality of private sector employment, one is dependent on people to come up with the ideas and to create the jobs.  We do not have a command economy, thanks be to God.  However, governments can make circumstances that are either conducive to job creation or not.  This is one plan that if carried through would put an extra burden of \u20ac89 million on employers.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach is the leader of the Minister of State's party and I hope he will speak to the Minister and to the T\u00e1naiste.  With regard to absenteeism in small private sector businesses, I define absenteeism as an employee not turning up for work because he or she does not feel like working.  The rate of absenteeism is very low, as is Monday morning sickness, in small enterprises.  In most small enterprises where there is a good relationship between the employer and the employees, all of them know that their future survival depends on them all making a contribution.  In most such cases, it is more of a team than a boss-worker relationship.<\/p><p>  I ask what is the Minister trying to stop.  Is it the case she has no other way of making the cuts and this looks like a handy way?  I suspect it is the latter.  There is no social gain out of this proposal.  I refer to the very low rate of absenteeism - at 2.6% - in small private sector employment, against 3.6% for companies employing more than 500.  It is understandable why the figure is higher.  The public service has even higher levels of absenteeism.  Where abnormally high levels of absenteeism exist, then I agree action should be taken and there should be an examination of the reasons for that absenteeism in order to eliminate it.  However, there should not be a burden placed on the employer because this will inhibit the creation of employment which is also urgently needed for the physical well-being well as the financial well-being of our people.<\/p><p>  I wish to deal with two specific actions which could be considered as a means of saving money.  <\/p><p>The first is to make individuals responsible for the first five days of sick leave.  It could be argued that, under this proposal, the current period would be extended by only two days and this would be of little gain.  We all know that if someone visits his or her general practitioner with a cold on a Thursday, the automatic reaction is to write a medical or sick certificate for an entire week.  In many cases, the period from Thursday to Monday morning is more than sufficient to allow people to recover and to return to work on Monday.  In smaller, private sector workplaces, people would return to work in such circumstances without any long-term effect on their health because they feel obliged to try to return to their employment as soon as possible.<\/p><p> People have a tendency to choose round numbers and one week is a round number in this case.  I suspect that if we made individuals responsible for the first five days of sick leave, they would ensure any medical certificate provided by a general practitioner would be for two days in circumstances where the weekend was approaching.  They would not miss work on the following Monday and Tuesday if it were clear they would have recovered by the end of the weekend.  Frequently, people need two days off before returning to work, whereas the norm for doctors is to provide a medical certificate for an entire week.  Most people would testify that this is the case.  However, many doctors do not consider the consequences of this practice.<\/p><p> Departmental records show that a significant number of sick leave claims are for two days.  A great deal of public service time is required to deal with these claims. While I was Minister, I had available to me a figure on the savings that would be achieved by extending the current period of two days to five days.  The Minister of State may ask the reason I did not make the necessary change.  I was informed by officials at the time that an EU regulation prevented me from making such a change.  Unfortunately, I was not in the Department for long enough to ascertain whether, in circumstances such as those prevailing at present, the regulation in question could be changed on the basis that it does not take account of human behaviour such as the tendency of doctors to provide medical certificates for one week.  It is possible to make this change and it would not impose an unwarranted burden on employees.  In many cases, the two days normally taken at the end of a five-day medical certificate would not be taken.<\/p><p> I used to be annoyed by another practice that is common in the public service.  If a person has a medical certificate for one month and feels well enough to return to work after three weeks, he or she is precluded from doing so on the basis that liability issues would arise if he or she were to become sick again.  I assure Deputies that a person in the private sector with a medical certificate for a month who felt well after two weeks would ignore such issues and return to work.  Some of the absenteeism in the public service is caused by current rules, including those pertaining to the number of sick days that can be taken without a medical certificate.  Steps must be taken to address this problem because it is not fair that people can take sick leave willy-nilly, leaving those who work hard and always turn up for work to carry the can.  The majority of public servants do not abuse the system.<\/p><p> As I stated, certain changes could be made and we have provided the Minister with an appropriate vehicle for doing so, namely, the Croke Park agreement.  A number of simple changes could generate savings.  As our spokesperson, Deputy Calleary, pointed out, the kite flown by the Minister is deterring employers from employing people.  I am aware of the Minister of State's commitment to and involvement in small business.  As someone with experience in this area, I ask him to inform the Minister that her proposal to add \u20ac89 million per annum to the cost of employing people is exactly the opposite of what she should be doing.  What we need to do, as the Fine Gael Party consistently preached while in opposition, is to make the country more competitive.  If the systems in place in other countries are not as competitive as our system, so be it.  What we need is a margin of competitiveness that places us ahead of the competition, rather than taking steps to make it harder and more expensive to employ people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300042#PP00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351020000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Calleary on moving this important motion and welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.  If we take as our starting point that the Government's top priority must be job creation and retention must, this should guide the rest of the debate on this motion and the proposal the Minister appears to be intent on pursuing.  We must also accept that economic recovery and job creation will be led by the private sector.  While the public sector can enable and facilitate job creation, the private sector will continue to be the driver of job creation.<\/p><p>  We should not do anything that damages the creation of jobs.  The first point anyone in business will make when discussing the role of government in the economy and job creation efforts is that Government should avoid doing any damage.  That is the context in which this debate is taking place.  It is indisputable that the Minister's proposal to require businesses to pay the first four weeks of illness benefits to their employees will cost jobs and its impact will be most acutely felt by small and medium sized businesses.  Faced with such a scenario, many companies would have no option other than to pay another employee to do additional hours or bring someone else into the company to cover for the person on sick leave.  This is a burden many employers would be unable to sustain in the current economic environment.  Thousands of businesses are hanging on by their finger tips and a single policy decision such as the Minister's proposal would be sufficient to push them over the edge.  The proposal would also affect large companies and make Ireland less attractive as a location for foreign direct investment.  It would be unjustifiable to impose such a burden on the owners of small businesses who must watch every euro their companies spend.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to clarify a matter.  At a recent briefing, the representatives of the various business bodies informed us that the Minister had indicated to them that her proposed statutory sick pay scheme would only affect businesses with more than 100 employees.  However, the relevant officials subsequently informed the same bodies that this was not the case.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the proposal on the table is comprehensive and includes an assessment of the impact of the measure on small, medium and larger businesses.  It would be helpful to know what the Minister is thinking in this regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Calleary provided a comprehensive statement on the context in which this proposal must be considered.  The number of people at work has fallen by more than 30,000 in the past 18 months, while the Central Statistics Office quarterly national household survey shows that the number of people out of work has increased.  If one adds to the level of net emigration the number of people who have moved onto activation schemes, the real picture is much worse than indicated by the official measure.  <\/p><p>  It is necessary to tackle the cost base faced by businesses.  Some progress has been made and the country's competitiveness has improved by 14% or 15% in recent years.  While this is a welcome development, more needs to be done to address the costs incurred by businesses, for example, in the area of energy.  The semi-State sector is still sheltered and exposed to limited competition. <\/p><p>When the cost base that semi-State companies have to live with increases the first thing they will do is pass that on to households and businesses.  Time and again we have seen the cost of utility bills increase significantly which had a huge impact on businesses already struggling.<\/p><p> Deputy Calleary referred to the employer PRSI rate of 10.75%, which is high.  That is a cost on employment and it would be insane to do anything at this juncture in our economic development that would increase the cost on employment.  It will be counterproductive, cost jobs and a decision we will come to regret.<\/p><p> The issue of absenteeism and the difference between absenteeism in the public sector and the private sector is something to which we will have to face up.  Everybody gets sick at some point in time but why is the level of absenteeism in the public sector so much higher than it is in the private sector?  The reality is that the public sector has a much more generous arrangement in place for people who become sick.  We know that employees in a small businesses in particular are acutely conscious of the impact on the business and on their employer if they are out of work sick for a period.  They know the business will suffer significantly if they are out work and that it will push additional costs onto the employer.  They know also that if they want to protect their jobs, going out of work sick is not a choice they want to make and they will avoid it at all costs.  We will have to get to grips with that problem.  Why is the level of sick leave in the health service and in the Civil Service so high?  It is because it is seen as an entitlement and almost as an extension of annual leave.  They believe they are entitled to so many days a year and they will take those days.  The Minister will have to grasp that nettle and bring in the unions if necessary to address the issue because it is not sustainable.<\/p><p> It is clear that a battle is going on within Government.  Although he cannot admit it the Minister of State's personal views would concur to a large extent with what he is hearing from Fianna F\u00e1il Deputies tonight.  I am aware his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has put his views on the record.  The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, has to make savings in her Department.  There is no easy way of doing that but it would be shortsighted if she were to choose this particular option because the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, which is referred to in the Government's amendment and dealt with by KPMG in its actuarial review, will get worse if she makes this change as it will result in many businesses closing and their contributions to the fund will be affected as a result.<\/p><p> I raise the issue of sick notes from general practitioners which must be faced up to.  How many GPs throughout the country are refusing to give sick notes to employees when they ask for them?  That is something the Government will have to examine in terms of the control measures that are in place to ensure that people who are claiming illness benefit for a short period are genuinely sick, and that that has been correctly verified.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the issue of small businesses which have to bring in additional help and pay for substitute work.  That is key.  When one talks to Enterprise Ireland, and IDA Ireland in particular, it is clear that when it comes to inward investment the client companies they are trying to attract into Ireland look at the overall package.  They look at the skills available in the labour force, the quality of the education system and the infrastructure but they are also looking at the cost of employing people.  There is no doubt that if this change is made it will make Ireland less attractive.  We can argue by how much but it will certainly make Ireland less attractive, and that will become a factor for such companies making decisions in that regard.<\/p><p> I am glad the Minister, Deputy Burton, has joined us.  The Minister has a difficult job in the coming weeks to come up with an adjustment of \u20ac3.5 billion.  It will not be easy to find that but in making those decisions she must ensure she does not damage any prospect of an economic recovery here because as the Labour Party rightly pointed out time and again from the Opposition benches, the cost of having somebody unemployed is approximately \u20ac20,000 a year when taxation revenue lost and the cost of paying social welfare is taken into account.  That is the way we will bring about a recovery.  We must do everything to support the people who are creating and maintaining jobs and when they speak with one voice and are tell us unanimously that this proposal will cost jobs, we must sit up and take notice and not proceed with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300043#QQ00200","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351020600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>In congratulating Deputy Calleary for bringing forward this motion I am bound to say that given the circumstances the country is in where we are ravaged by unemployment and drained by emigration it is surreal that the Opposition has to come into this House and use Private Members' time to plead with the Government not to engage in yet another act of wanton job destruction.<\/p><p>  I picked out at random a question I put down to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, last year dated 19 July in which I asked him if he was satisfied with the efforts being made by Government to fulfil its election promises and to tackle unemployment.  That reply given 15 months ago states:<blockquote>The Government is acutely aware of the scale of the challenge that we face in combating unemployment, with nearly 440,000 people on the live register.  This new Government is committed to getting people back to work.<\/blockquote>That reply was given 15 months ago and 15 months later the position has not improved.  In fact, it has got worse.  As Deputy McGrath said, the official figure is still approximately 440,000 but up to 60% of that represents people who are now long-term unemployed.  Another figure we cannot quantify is the number of people who are hiding in the education system or in the various schemes, which I welcome in so far as they go but they mask the true rate of unemployment in this country.<\/p><p>  Even more tragically, in the 15 months since the Minister uttered those words across the floor of this House, and these are the Government's figures, 100,000 people have left this country not, as the Minister for Finance would have us believe, to study the seven wonders of the world but because they had no jobs.  They had to go abroad to get employment.  One hundred thousand people, 2.5% in a population of approximately 4 million, left the country in the past 15 months.  That is over 200 a day, and many of those carry with them the skills they acquired here at great expense to the taxpayer.  They are the skills necessary for this country to have if we are to trigger an economic recovery.<\/p><p>  Last year I recall pleading with the Government not to change the redundancy scheme.  It was proposing that employers who were carrying 40% of redundancy payments would have that increased to 85% but the Government went ahead anyway and laid a burden of approximately &#8364;0.25 billion a year on the backs of business, particularly small businesses which are the main job creators in this country.  That has cost jobs.  If time permitted I could give the Minister instances of employers who found it easier to close rather than involve themselves in a partial shutdown because the partial shutdown would cost them so much they would not be able to continue in business.  That is a reality.<\/p><p>  We now have further kites about increasing PRSI on employers.  That is directly taxing work again at a time when unemployment is raging, and now we have this scheme.  Deputy Calleary pointed out that we are not comparing like with like but that we are comparing like with different.  The fact is if it was four weeks across the 27 member states and if everything was equal, even costs, which are much higher here in many instances, can anybody imagine a worse time to introduce a proposal such as this?  What is the grand strategy?  I wish I could see it because viewed in isolation it makes no sense to me to continue to load burden after burden on the backs of the people who are creating employment at a time when the country is racked by unemployment.  That is the reality.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach told us as late as yesterday that 58 out of 67 of the boxes in the jobs activation programme or the programme for jobs, whatever it is called, have been ticked in the last quarter yet the situation continues to get worse.<\/p><p>As he understands the problems facing small businesses, many of which are hanging on by their fingertips, I wish the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, had the authority to reassure them that this further imposition in charges will not go ahead.  In doing so, the Government would do more for job creation and to instil confidence than what is in all of the boxes it has ticked and will tick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300044#RR00200","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351021200,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I move amendment No.1 :<blockquote>To delete all words after &#8220;D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann&#8221;

Small businesses are the lifeblood of the country.  Over 90% of companies are small businesses which employ 655,000 people and contribute \u20ac10 billion to the Exchequer each year.<\/p><p>  While statutory sick pay has been the subject of a consultation process initiated by the Minister for Social Protection, this is a very complex issue that calls for a whole of government discussion.  To date, no formal proposals have been put to the Government on the matter.  The Government is absolutely focused on ensuring Irish companies are supported in every way to develop their business, increase exports, create jobs and rebuild the economy.  The ability of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, to succeed and grow underpins our future potential for job creation, growth and prosperity.  The challenge of regaining competitiveness has been tackled head on by the Government and recent international league tables are testament to our achievements to date in this regard.  All of the actions we have taken since taking office have focused on developing the conditions which will support the creation of jobs across all regions.  More needs to be done and we will continue as we have started.<\/p><p>  I will remind the House of some of the most notable steps we have taken in support of enterprises since entering office.  For several years, owing to the collapse of the banking system, accessing credit has been particularly difficult for SMEs.  The Government has shown a determination to improve the position.  We have recapitalised the banks.  The economic management council meets them on a regular basis and has emphasised the need to provide additional lending to allow businesses to grow.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, through the Action Plan for Jobs, we are delivering several measures to fill gaps where market failures continue.  These include establishing a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme, setting up a microfinance loan fund and supporting the development of a dynamic venture capital industry.  The partial credit guarantee scheme which was launched last week by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will benefit innovative, job-creating businesses that face obstacles in accessing credit because they do not have conventional collateral, or because they operate in sectors with which the banks are not familiar.  The scheme will facilitate up to \u20ac150 million of additional lending per annum to SMEs.  The benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation include the creation of over 1,000 jobs and a contribution of over \u20ac25 million to the Exchequer through tax revenues and welfare cost savings.<\/p><p>  The microfinance loan fund has been open for applications since 1 October.  It will support commercially viable microenterprises that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The scheme will initially facilitate \u20ac40 million in additional lending in the next five years to businesses employing ten people or fewer, with provision for the scheme to be extended to provide an additional \u20ac50 million of lending over a further five years at that point.  The scheme has the potential to help create over 7,700 jobs in the next ten years.  Loans of up to \u20ac25,000 will be available to those microenterprises that have been declined credit by a bank.<\/p><p>  These are just two examples of the practical actions the Government has taken under the Action Plan for Jobs to help businesses and support employment.  The action plan contains over 270 measures to transform the economy and get people back to work.  Other measures the Government is taking to support business competitiveness include reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms to make it more appropriate to our modern economy, while reducing the administrative burden on business through a project across seven Departments and the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department has achieved a 24.5% reduction in administrative burdens in the areas of company law, employment law and health and safety law, yielding potential savings of \u20ac206 million per annum for business.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has encouraged local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.  All but one local authority have frozen or reduced their annual rate of valuation this year.  That one local authority increased its annual rate of valuation owing to a legal requirement following the extension of a town boundary.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has made it easier for employers to recruit a person off the live register through the simplification and extension of the employers PRSI exemption scheme.  The Government is actively promoting this through its engagement with companies and business representative bodies, as well as through other financial supports to business.  Recently in Sligo we launched a one-stop shop in mentoring and training for the unemployed.<\/p><p>  Ensuring more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key part of our plans for job creation and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of services to small and microbusinesses.  This will include the development of a new small and microbusiness division within Enterprise Ireland as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports for the small and microenterprise sectors.  It has also seen the dissolution of the county and city enterprise boards and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland and the establishment of local enterprise offices to provide a high quality, innovative, one-stop shop support service for small businesses within local authorities, while providing early access to the services of national bodies.  The new structures will be benchmarked against best practice, will be open to all businesses, whether they are trading locally or getting ready to export, and be measured against clear and ambitious targets.<\/p><p>  A high level implementation working group chaired by my Department is progressing the range of issues involved.  It is intended the process will be completed as rapidly as possible.  My Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding detailed primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements.  These will obviously come before the House in the normal legislative manner.  In the interim, as much as possible will be achieved on an administrative basis to get the local enterprise offices up and running as quickly as possible, well in advance of having the legislation in place.<\/p><p>  The actions we are pursuing through the Action Plan for Jobs are aimed at improving Ireland's overall competitiveness, reducing costs and ensuring the enterprise environment is supportive of companies which can sustain and create jobs.  I am often amazed at how competent and creative many of the small enterprises are that I encounter around the country.  Our efforts are being reflected in improved international competitiveness ratings.  Ireland is ranked 20th in this year's International Institute for Management Development world competitiveness yearbook.  It is ranked 27th in the latest World Economic Forum global competitiveness index.  Ireland's position in both indices has improved this year after several years of slipping downwards.<\/p><p>  There are several key areas in which Ireland tops the global list, including the business impact of rules on foreign direct investment, inflation, foreign direct investment and technology transfer, skilled labour, flexibility and adaptability of the labour force, and investment incentives.  The progress the Government has made in its first 18 months in office is encouraging.  Employment in export-oriented companies supported by my Department's agencies has increased by a net 10,000 in the past 18 months.  This is in sharp contrast to losses of 45,000 jobs among such companies in the previous three years.<\/p><p>  In spite of job losses in more traditional sectors such as construction and domestic financial services, we are seeing an increase in the numbers of jobs in emerging areas targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs such as tourism and information and communications technology.  There have been several significant job announcements in the past few weeks in the case of indigenous companies, as well as foreign investment.<\/p><p>It is particularly encouraging that exports from indigenous companies have been growing even faster than foreign direct investment, reaching \u20ac15.2 billion in 2011, the highest level ever and a remarkable achievement.<\/p><p> The action plan for jobs shows our commitment to implement change and reform on a step-by-step basis, to re-energise the economy and address a failed economic model too reliant on unsustainable sectors.  That is the backdrop.  More than 90% of all measures for delivery under the action plan in the first three quarters of this year have been completed on time.  We must continue to work across Government to ensure that we have a balanced approach to fiscal consolidation while being supportive of enterprise.  The Cabinet committee system provides a mechanism to ensure co-operation and collaboration across Government.<\/p><p> My Department works bilaterally with the Department of Social Protection on a range of issues that cut across both Departments.  With regard to statutory sick pay, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has been engaged in a consultation process with key stakeholders to examine the issues arising from the potential introduction of such a scheme in Ireland.  However, this process is not yet complete and no formal proposals have been brought to Government.  Any consideration of such an issue must be examined in great detail and in particular must be scrutinised through the lens of small business, taking all factors into account.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, will elaborate on the factors underpinning her consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300045#SS00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351021800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Before I refer to the issues directly associated with statutory sick pay, I am keen to emphasise in the clearest possible terms that the Government is totally committed to the role the 200,000 small and medium sized enterprises play in the Irish economy, employing more than 650,000 people.  This point was also outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.  These enterprises contribute some \u20ac10 billion to the Exchequer each year.  In many ways they are the backbone of our economy and our communities and they are central to our economic recovery.  Precisely because of our commitment to the SME sector the Government's action plan for jobs 2012 contains more than 270 measures to transform the economy, including many initiatives to improve supports for business.  The Government also provides a range of measures to support employers which place people in employment.  These include the JobBridge national internship scheme, which I launched, the employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme, also an initiative from my Department since I became Minister, the revenue job assistance scheme, also from my Department, and several workplace supports specifically for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  I need not remind Deputies that our social welfare system is the product of an evolutionary process dating back at least 100 years.  Welfare states have evolved in Europe and elsewhere as a combination of the social welfare system, what the State provides; the fiscal welfare system, benefits provided through the tax system; and the occupational welfare system, social benefits provided by employers or employees through their contributions.  Other countries, including Sweden, for example, which has an open trading economy like ours, have undertaken welfare reform in the area of disability and illness.  They have placed certain obligations on employers, including paying for an initial period of absence through illness.  This formed a key element of the reform process of social welfare.<\/p><p>  My Department will spend an estimated \u20ac847 million on illness benefit payments in 2012.  The Department will spend some \u20ac3.4 billion this year on the range of illness and disability payments to provide income supports to almost 300,000 people, adults of working age, and their families.  These figures are somewhat incredible and the figure of 300,000 people indicates that almost one in six people of working age, or 16% of our working age population, is in receipt of an illness or disability related payment.  The figures are truly astonishing.  During the past ten years, especially when the economy was going so well, the number of people in receipt of an illness or disability-related payment from the Department of Social Protection has risen by more than 100,000 and expenditure on disability payments has increased by more than \u20ac2 billion.  I listened carefully to the contributions of the two spokespeople from Fianna F\u00e1il but how or why did Fianna F\u00e1il let this occur at the most prosperous time in the history of the country?  How did Fianna F\u00e1il manage to put an extra 100,000 people on some form of illness or disability payment?  We must reflect on that question as part of the discussion under way tonight.  These are staggering figures and Members will be aware that the social insurance fund, from which illness benefit payments are made, is seriously in deficit.  The deficit is expected to be \u20ac1.82 billion in 2012.<\/p><p>  While consideration of all the issues is not yet complete and, as the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, noted, no final proposals are under consideration by the Government, this is the background against which the question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, SPP, for the public and private sectors is being considered.  Anyway, it is part of my role as Minister for Social Protection to provide for the long-term sustainability of the social insurance system for our pensioners and those who become unemployed or fall ill.  This is the essence of the social insurance scheme, an insurance scheme into which one pays when one is earning such that one can draw benefits at another stage.  Like all insurance schemes, if one has far more people claiming than the scheme was designed for, then one must question how to keep vital supports for people who have fallen ill and as a result can no longer work.  Both Fianna F\u00e1il Deputies across the floor have been involved in business and they know perfectly well what I am referring to, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.  This is an important issue, one that we must reflect on as a country in terms of how we best direct resources to the people who require this support.<\/p><p>  The least I can do is to ask my officials to examine where the boundaries between the State and the private sector lie in the area of protection of people from loss of income from employment through illness.  This aspect is vital.  An earlier Fianna F\u00e1il from the time of Lemass would have recognised the importance of doing this and of carrying out an honest examination of these matters.  This is difficult for all parties throughout the House because during the boom years, Fianna F\u00e1il had no problem raising the numbers claiming by the astonishing figure of 100,000.  Will the Fianna F\u00e1il Deputies present go back to some of the people who were in government at the time - I realise Deputy Calleary held a Minister of State position for some time - to ask how this occurred?  I have received no explanation for it yet.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to some of the specific issues associated with the question of statutory sick pay.  Consideration of the merits of introducing such a scheme revolves around two separate but related strategic issues, the need to secure Exchequer savings on one hand - let us not forget that Fianna F\u00e1il bequeathed us a very tough programme that it signed up to with the IMF - and the need to drive positive policy reforms on the other.<\/p><p> The question of introducing statutory sick pay was advanced in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure undertaken in 2011.  It was also considered on several occasions by Fianna F\u00e1il in Government, for instance, in 2009, as part of the an bord snip nua process.  Such a scheme undoubtedly has the potential to deliver savings to the Exchequer, in terms of reduced expenditure on illness benefit.  It is estimated that savings of \u20ac23 million would result if statutory sick pay were payable for one week and \u20ac89 million if it were payable for four weeks.<\/p><p> The House will be aware that I recently published the 2010 actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund.  Among the key findings of the review was that the fund currently has a significant shortfall of expenditure over income with, for instance, estimated expenditure of \u20ac9 billion set against income of \u20ac7.5 billion in 2011.  In the absence of any action to tackle the shortfall, the 2011 deficit of \u20ac1.5 billion will double to \u20ac3.0 billion by 2019 or, expressed as a percentage of GNP, the shortfall will increase from 1.1% of GNP in 2011 to 2% in 2019 and unless PRSI income increases and-or expenditure levels are reduced, the Exchequer subvention will need to more than treble, from 2011 levels, by 2030 and increase by a factor of almost eight by 2040.<\/p><p> It needs to be said also that we still have one of the lowest average rates of employer PRSI as measured by the OECD.  Many of our European competitor countries devote more of the total contribution by employees, in particular, in terms of tax and PRSI-like payments, to funding their social insurance system.  At an average employer contribution of 9.7%, Ireland is well below, for example, 18.2% in Finland, 16.2% in Germany, 23% in Belgium, and 12.9% in Poland.  That, of course, is one of the reasons that the Social Insurance Fund is running a substantial and growing deficit.<\/p><p> I need to stress another important point, one which has been lost in some of the more strident responses to the possibility of the introducing a statutory sick-pay scheme.  Under the illness benefit scheme, there is a waiting period of three days where, subject to any arrangements within the company or the employment, the employee bears the cost.  This waiting period would be carried through into any scheme of statutory sick pay, and any notion that statutory sick pay would create an incentive to take extra days off is, therefore, wrong.<\/p><p> Ireland is an outlier when it comes to employers being obliged to fund some element of sick absence pay.  Most other European countries, including all of our major competitors, oblige employers to pay for some sick pay costs.  The reason for that is it helps to manage the sick pay and places a focus in the company on wellness so that the employer and the employee take responsibility for an employee who becomes ill for whatever reason being assisted to get back to work as quickly as possible.  By contrast, in some instances, unfortunately, our arrangements almost end up encouraging employees to stay out longer and longer and then miss their connection with the labour force.  That is something of which Members on all sides of the House will be aware.  Across the Border, the extent of the obligation is 28 weeks for employers in the North.  It is two years in the Netherlands; six weeks in Germany; and nine days in Finland.  Those are our competitor countries and Ireland is an outlier.<\/p><p> The 2008 OECD report, Sickness, Disability and Work - Breaking the Barriers, was explicit on this point, noting that in Ireland &quot;the potential of employers being part of the solution for raising labour market participation of people with health problems or disability is largely untapped&quot;.  The report went on to recommend that Ireland should &quot;investigate the potential of strengthening the financial incentives for employers e.g. by introducing a mandatory period of employer-provided sick-pay&quot;.<\/p><p> We are living through an intensely difficult economic period.  Deputy Perry and I have spoken of the commitment of everybody in the House to small employers being encouraged and supported.  As Minister, I have launched several schemes to support them because they are the backbone.  However, we need open minds.  How can we, as a first-world country, have 16% of those of working age on some kind of illness or disability benefit?  I do not know how Fianna F\u00e1il added on an extra 100,000 people in the good years when there was a great deal of money in the economy.  All I will say is that for employees who become ill when they are in work, who maybe develop a serious condition or a mobility problem, a good structure of support on illness is central to the concept of the welfare state, which is what earlier members of Fianna F\u00e1il such as the late Taoiseach, Se\u00e1n Lemass, always stood for.  Equally, we must have a system that encourages people to get back to work so that a couple of days' illness that becomes repeated does not end up in that individual, unfortunately, losing all connection with the labour force.  That is a social loss to us as a society but it is also as great a loss to the individual and his or her family.  We need a detailed debate on the issue of how we built up the level of problems that have become evident in terms of the numbers of people affected and how we help them to get back to work so that they become, once again, financially independent for themselves and their families.  Equally, for those who develop a serious illness, our system needs to be able to recognise that even more rapidly, and then give them the very careful consideration and support of which, in terms of a welfare state, they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300046#TT00200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351022400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I will outline the context of this debate.  In the three years up to March 2011 when the Government took office, the retail jobs sector was in free-fall and 250,000 jobs were lost in that area.  From the point of view of small businesses and what Government has done to support them, let me remind the House that the action plan for jobs has four critical areas, namely, starting a business, growing a business, recruitment and, in particular, access to credit.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State touched on this in their contributions.  The microfinance scheme is a fund set up to assist small businesses with ten employees or less to get loans of up to \u20ac25,000.  That fund, in the region of a number of million euro in total, will be used to create 7,700 jobs over the next three years.  The credit guarantee scheme, an innovative way to provide much needed lending to small and medium-sized enterprise, is a fund of \u20ac450 million.  That scheme will provide additional lending of \u20ac150 million per year for three years.  That is a significant issue because we will all be aware of the difficulties that SMEs encountered in terms of accessing finance.<\/p><p>  That brings us to the motion before the House.  The social welfare spend is approximately \u20ac20 billion.  One would not need to be an economist to know that it is entirely unsustainable.  This Administration, in the last budget, did something that many of the commentators stated was not possible, namely, it maintained basic rates of social welfare.  One must bear in mind that as an economic generator, the social welfare spend is vital to the economy, in particular the rural economy.  These are the people who go into towns and villages around the country and spend the payment that they receive every week.  There is a connection.  These measures are not isolated.  The dynamic that is necessary to support businesses is as much about the person spending as it is about the person providing that service.<\/p><p>The Netherlands, for example, had a rate of absenteeism of 8% until it introduced a scheme similar to the one proposed here and that rate is now only 4%.  Absenteeism is costing Ireland over \u20ac800 million per annum, which is an enormous amount.  How did we allow that to develop to the point that it did during the boom years?  It does not say much for us now, in recessionary times, if we do not try to address it.  <\/p><p> Managing sick leave is also an issue in this debate.  At the moment there is no incentive for employers to manage sick leave because the State is carrying the can and providing the cash.  There is a vicious circle in operation.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister is setting up a forum through which all stakeholders can come to table, debate the issue, exchange views and formulate opinions.  That process is very important in terms of reaching a decision.  We must look at this not from the perspective of moaning and groaning about businesses here and there - although there are genuine issues and we are required to raise them on the floor of the House - but from the perspective of the public purse and obtaining value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300047#UU00200","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351023000,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Some months ago the Minister for Social Protection indicated that she intended to introduce statutory sick pay and that she was considering making employers pay the first four weeks of illness benefit which is currently paid from the PRSI fund, and Exchequer transfers when that fund is low, as it is currently.  The PRSI fund and its associate schemes are like one big community-rated insurance policy which protects both employers and workers when they fall on hard times.  The references that were made to the introduction of statutory sick pay made it sound like a positive development but in reality what is proposed is essentially a cut of \u20ac89 million in the illness benefit scheme into which employers and employees pay.  Employers and workers have a reasonable expectation that the Social Insurance Fund into which they pay will also pay out when needed.  This particular proposal, or more correctly, cut, which passes on an \u20ac89 million burden to employers, with no regard to their ability to pay, will result in some employers being forced to close their businesses.  It will also lead to redundancies and wage cuts.  Sick workers will see their pay packets reduced.  One of the worst elements of this proposal is that it may lead to discrimination against those with disabilities or recurring illnesses.<\/p><p>  I caution the Minister against proceeding with her proposal, especially since there are alternatives, and I will come to my party's alternatives later.  The Government has proposed cutting illness benefit because there is not enough money in the PRSI fund, which we accept as true.  However, to some extent, that problem is not just the fault of Fianna F\u00e1il, as some have tried to claim here, but is also of the current Government's making, when it cut the amount that employers had to pay into the fund from what was already a very low base by international standards.  From 1 July 2011, the lower rate of employer PRSI was halved to 4.25% for all jobs that pay up to \u20ac356 per week.  The rate is due to be restored to 8.5% from 1 January 2014.  Far from stemming job losses, as was claimed at the time, some 33,000 additional jobs have been lost in that period.  The lower rate of PRSI also incentivised unscrupulous employers to cut wages and reduce workers' hours.  We warned the Government and the Minister for Social Protection at the time that the cut would make the deficit in the PRSI fund even worse but they chose not to listen.  <\/p><p>  This Government has already cut the redundancy rebate.  Now it is proposing to cut the illness benefit scheme.  What is next?  Will the maternity benefit scheme be next?  What is the next cut to workers' protection that the Minister will propose?  The Government's proposals will possibly force small employers to close down their businesses.  If one takes the example of a garage with one employee who keeps the garage open, if that person is on sick leave, the employer not only has to provide illness benefit, but also has to pay another person to keep the garage open and keep the business going.  Small operations potentially could be wiped out by such additional costs and jobs could be lost.  <\/p><p>  Sick workers will suffer because many employers will abandon their more generous sick pay arrangements and offer only the statutory minimum.  One of the employers' organisations has suggested that up to 60% of employers include some type of sick pay provision, over and above the illness benefit, in contracts of employment.  That extra element will be the first thing to go.  We must not forget that a householder's outgoings do not reduce just because he or she is sick.  In fact, in most cases, they increase and the maximum rate of illness benefit, at \u20ac188 per week, is well below what most people would earn.<\/p><p>  The move would prompt an increase in discrimination against people with disabilities and those who suffer ill health.  When employers are hiring people, they look at the potential future cost of employees.  This is a small country and potential employers could know, for example, that candidate X suffered from cancer or candidate Y has had a relapse of a serious illness.  That could become a disincentive to employing that person and cause him or her to suffer discrimination.  While there are laws to protect workers against discrimination, it is very difficult to prove and very hard to win such a case.  All that will happen is a further clogging up of the industrial relations mechanisms.  The Minister can prevent that by not proceeding with her proposal.<\/p><p>  The motion before us rightly calls on the Government not to proceed with the proposal but it does not offer an alternative.  To be credible in opposition, one cannot just say &quot;No&quot; to everything.  One must put forward realistic alternatives.  Hopefully, I have done so with the proposals I have put forward today.  Sinn F\u00e9in is opposed to the cut to the illness benefit scheme and will vote against it.  The Minister's proposal to hike employers' costs in an indiscriminate way, without heed to ability to pay, could not come at a worse time.  It will undoubtedly cost jobs and cause hardship.  If the Minister really believes that employers should be contributing more in terms of illness support for workers, she should raise money from those employers who can afford it, with PRSI contributions set at rates that are progressive and reflective of ability to pay.  My party suggests that the Minister raise the employer's PRSI contribution made on pay exceeding \u20ac100,000 to 15.75%, which would raise \u20ac91.5 million, a figure very close to the Minister's-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300048#VV00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1351023000,"counter":647,"content":"<p>That represents an increase of one third.

Over the past four years, more jobs were lost in this State on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis than in any other western country since the Great Depression.  All we see from the Government, however, are policies that will further depress the economy and make it more difficult for small businesses.  The Taoiseach promised 100,000 new jobs, although his tally currently stands at minus 33,000, and promised that the all-consuming obsession of every Minister would be the creation of jobs, but the Minister for Social Protection must have missed that day's memorandum.  While the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation trumpets the strategy of reducing PRSI contributions for small businesses, the Minister for Social Protection plans to do the opposite by shifting &#8364;89 million from her budget onto the small and medium-sized enterprises sector.  We are told this must be done because of the pressures that bear down on the PRSI system.  The primary pressure on the PRSI system at present is the burgeoning unemployment figure.

The Government has failed to tackle upward-only rents or energy and insurance costs.  It changed procurement guidelines to make it more difficult for small businesses to tender for contracts.  This is being done in the context of the Government's pursuit of the troika programme despite the damage it is inflicting on the economy.  The absence of a comprehensive and co-ordinated strategy across Government has resulted in 33,000 fewer jobs since it came to power.  Emigration is at levels not seen since the 1800s.

I cannot believe the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, could stand over these policies.  As a businessman, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, should know better.  He stated the Government is profoundly aware of the role that small and medium-sized enterprises play in terms of employing more than 650,000 people and contributing \u20ac10 billion to the Exchequer annually.  These businesses are tired of all this back slapping and the Government's empty promises.  Small business people are on their knees.  Deputies from rural constituencies see this every day of the week in their clinics.  Business people cannot get finance or support from anyone.  Local authority rates and the other costs associated with businesses are too high.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Burton, cited international figures but other countries know how to support employers.  Businesses have received no support from recent Governments.  The Minister admitted privately to me in the restaurant one evening during an event with the Irish contractors association that the real problem is in the public service.  We are afraid to tackle the public service, however.<\/p><p>  I have been a small employer for more than 30 years.  I know my business intimately and I have the best of employees.  Most small employers have excellent relationships with their staff.  Big companies which are supported by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland can afford sick payment schemes.  They are cushioned, but the man in the middle is the backbone of rural Ireland.  The Minister did not mention the 20,000 to 30,000 farmers who employ their wives or two or three farm workers.<\/p><p>  I beg the Minister to listen before she puts the final nail in the coffin for small businesses.  I admire what she is trying to do at Cabinet and I recognise the difficulties she faces in dealing with right-wing Ministers.  I respect that she must try to protect her own budget but this is not the way to do it.  I recently held a public meeting on this subject in my constituency and I received a very large number of e-mails and messages of support.  People have told me that they have faced repeated knocks.  Their overdrafts are being removed and they are made to take out term loans if banks are even prepared to give them a penny.  Banks are choking small businesses.  Tax officials, who I respect in the main, have pursued aggressive policies over the past two years to balance their books.  The officials who work in the tax offices, local authority rates departments or health and safety agencies should be put behind the counter of a small business for at least one week every year to learn how difficult it is to earn the money to pay wages, overheads and PRSI.  In many cases employers pay the first three days of sick leave because they have an exceptional relationship with their employees.  The employee may return from sick leave after one or two days because of this good relationship.  That relationship will be destroyed by the Minister's proposals.<\/p><p>  I received an e-mail today from a hotelier in my constituency who employed two workers, who were, unfortunately, non-nationals, but that does not matter because it applies across the scheme.  Six weeks ago he put them on a three day week but he wanted them to return on a full-time basis this week because he was busy again.  They told him they would lose too many benefits if they did so.  I have been there myself.  Employees have told me they have too many benefits.  We have to change that system.  It has to be rewarding to go to work.  There are certain costs associated with work but we cannot permit such a system to continue.  People might have been working with an employer for years, as they were in my case, and it hurts to put them on a three day week, but that may be all the employer can afford.  The benefits take over and the employers are doing better with three days of work and two days of social welfare.  They do not want to come back.  There is evidence that such problems have arisen.<\/p><p>  If this new sick pay system is introduced, certain people will take advantage of it.  If it is not available, they will not abuse it.  The low hanging fruit will be taken.  I plead with the Minister and her officials to visit small business people.  The troika should be made aware of what is happening to the backbone of our country.  They do not get any grants and they set up enterprises with their own savings.  They were supported by the banks for a number of years but now they are left high and dry.  Make haste slowly.  If there is a problem in the public service, it should be addressed.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced he would save \u20ac75 million but all he achieved was \u20ac3 million.  We have to deal with the elephant in the room.  I do not want to criticise ordinary public servants but the problem with sick play does not lie with private employers.  Why use a sledgehammer to crack a chestnut?  Deal with the problem fairly and honestly and consult widely before acting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012102300049#WW00700","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351023600,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351023600,"counter":657,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 October 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
