Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department did provide funding to Cavan County Council, acting as lead authority for Councils in the area,  of over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design. However, the  extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance\/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. <\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason the primary focus for capital investment at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.  There is no provision under the NDP for the  improvement of the Cavan to Dundalk section of the East- West link. <\/p>  <p>  Some limited provision is being made in the capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects.  This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.  In this context the Department has provided grants to Cavan Council since 2018 to enable the Council to update the assessment of the regional and local road section of the proposed scheme in line with the current requirements in the Public Spending Code. The aim was to assess the extent to which the scheme or elements of it could be justified.  The work undertaken to date has pointed to a substantial increase in the estimated cost of a full scheme to upgrade roads between Dundalk and Cavan.

It was a fruitful and productive meeting which facilitated a useful exchange of views and ideas and I look forward to meeting with them in the near future once I have had an opportunity to fully consider these issues with officials in my Department.  Nonetheless, I remain of the view that meetings with such groups can complement engagement with the Advisory Committee for Small Public Service Vehicles, but should not substitute for engagement with the Committee.  That statutory Committee has an important role to play and I therefore do not favour its abolition.<\/p>  <p>  The small public service vehicle industry is a diverse one, featuring taxis, which are predominantly based in urban areas, hackneys and local area hackneys which tend to provide services in more rural areas, and limousines which are often particularly geared towards overseas tourism and special events like weddings and funerals. Given this range of services it is only fitting that this diverse industry is represented by a body such as the Advisory Committee which enjoys a broad membership which can represent the diversity of service providers, service users, and other stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  To date, membership of the Committee has been somewhat Dublin-centric. This is perhaps understandable given that most of the meetings of the Committee were held in Dublin. However, the onset of COVID-19 has meant that, like many State Boards and Advisory Committees, meetings have shifted online. This, I believe, creates an opportunity to secure broader participation in bodies of this nature than may have been possible previously. As the Deputy may be aware, two vacancies recently arose on the Committee. These vacancies, combined with a further three vacancies which the Committee had been carrying pre-pandemic, provide me with an opportunity to try to secure greater representation from rural and remote parts of Ireland. A recruitment campaign for the Committee will shortly commence and I will be actively seeking new members from other parts of the country to ensure the Committee has an appropriate geographic spread of perspectives. As a means of securing further balance in terms of the range of representation on the Committee, I will be encouraging applications from individuals who are hackney operators and limousine operators as part of this forthcoming campaign.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to vehicle age limits, as I mentioned in my earlier response, this is a matter for the NTA as the statutory regulator. I would like to remind the House that, for vehicles that were due to reach the age limit from March onward, the NTA has already provided an extension until the end of the year. This means that no operator has needed to replace their vehicle due to the vehicle age limit rule since the start of the pandemic. However, while the NTA will consider further limited extensions later in the year, it will not enact the kind of blanket extension of age limits of the type proposed by taxi representatives. This Government is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of the national SPSV fleet and a blanket extension of age limits would undermine these efforts. My Department has a number of specific initiatives to encourage the movement away from fossil fuels in the small public service vehicle sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme offers up to &euro;10,000 towards the purchase of an electric small public service vehicle, and a further &euro;2,500 towards its conversion to a wheelchair accessible vehicle. To date almost 90 electric taxis have been purchased under this Scheme, converting mostly from diesel models to zero-tailpipe battery electric alternates.<\/p>  <p>  The eSPSV Charger Project which will see the installation of SPSV-dedicated EV chargers at Dublin and Cork Airports as well as in train stations in Dublin (Heuston), Limerick (Colbert) and Cork (Kent). This project is funded from ring-fenced revenue arising from the increase in carbon tax following Budget 2020, and it is expected that the chargers will be installed by the end of the year and operational from early 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned in my earlier response, I do not believe the reintroduction of quantitative limits on SPSV licences by Government would serve the wider public interest and therefore I do not plan to implement a moratorium on the issuance of SPSV licences at this time. The present SPSV licensing system is built upon the principle that the purpose of a licence is to indicate a person&rsquo;s suitability to carry out a function and to ensure that the holder of a licence is subject to lawful conditions and restrictions. As such, a licence should not have, by association, a monetary value or be tradable on the open market. Accordingly, there is no basis for a \"buy back\" scheme of the type outlined by the Deputy in his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[15878\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will bring forward sectoral specific legislation or measures to protect jobs in the aviation sector.","asker":"1467","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>I wish to thank the Deputy for her question.  I appreciate that the challenges facing Irish aviation are having a real impact on many of her constituents, given the employment in North Dublin, especially, provided by Dublin Airport and by all of the ancillary businesses serving the airport. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s long term economic wellbeing is closely linked to our global connectivity.  Being an island nation, aviation plays a key role in this connectivity, and it will be an important part of our economic recovery from this crisis. While Covid-19 has impacted many parts of our economy and society, it is clear that the aviation sector has been particularly severely affected.  <\/p>  <p>  It has not been easy for the sector to see demand depressed for so long a period. I accept that there is a desire within the industry to stimulate a recovery and to allow it to trade itself back into financial health.  However, we must also accept that we are in an unprecedented environment, with a good deal of uncertainty still surrounding the future.  As the current resurgence of Covid cases within Ireland and throughout Europe shows, as much as we all want to return to life as normal that choice is not open to us at this moment.    <\/p>  <p>  The Government understands fully the role that aviation plays in terms of its contribution to GDP, FDI and job creation.   Measures have already been implemented to provide it with support:  the wage subsidy scheme, continued alleviation of commercial rates, tax claw back measures, and the offer of liquidity support, which is available to the aviation sector through the Government&rsquo;s &euro;2 billion ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund. <\/p>  <p>  There is a case to be made for further sector specific measures.  This is because clearly in trying to limit the level of international travel to essential travel only, aviation is not being given a real chance to recover.  I can advise the Deputy that such measures are being considered, and the recommendations of the Aviation Recovery Taskforce - which reported in July - are part of that.  I cannot give specific commitments at this time because it is part of the ongoing Budget deliberations, and there are many competing demands on the public purse, especially from the health sector.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the importance of the aviation industry is well understood and that the Government will do all that it can to support it through the very difficult period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[25895\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will continue to engage with representatives of taxi drivers in view of the difficulties they are experiencing due to the fall off in demand as a result of Covid-19.","asker":"1568","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, I met with delegates from four taxi representative groups the week before last.

I also intend to meet again with taxi representatives in the near future once I have had an opportunity to fully consider these issues with my Department and the NTA. However, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs remains the primary stakeholder engagement forum for the SPSV industry. This is appropriate given its broad membership which represents a wide range of interests. It is also important to recognise the statutory basis and remit of the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (sometimes known as the Taxi Advisory Committee) which is established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to advise the Minister and the NTA in relation to the SPSV industry. <\/p>  <p>  The Committee meets monthly and has a broad membership, with representatives of drivers, Licenced Taxi Dispatch Operators, disabled passengers, older passengers, the tourist industry, consumer groups, local government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Its strength comes from the diversity of voices represented all sharing the commitment to having a well-functioning, effective SPSV sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee plays an important role advising the National Transport Authority and Minister. In that capacity, in June earlier this year, former Minister Ross invited the Committee to develop proposals on how to support the small public service vehicle industry during the Covid-19 pandemic. The proposals received in July have been an important basis for dialogue and engagement as we have sought to understand the challenges faced by the industry and how best to address their needs.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the Committee&rsquo;s proposals have been accepted and are in the process of being implemented. For example, the Committee recommended a review of demand for taxis be undertaken &ndash; the National Transport Authority is undertaking such a review.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee also recommended that late licence renewal fees be waived - the National Transport Authority has waived those late renewal fees through to March 2021. The Committee recommended that small public service vehicle operators be able to avail of interest-free credit &ndash; operators may avail of loans with an interest-free period under the COVID-19 Business Loans Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Some proposals within the Committee&rsquo;s report relate to policy areas under the remit of my Ministerial colleagues. the report has therefore served as a valuable basis for engagement by my Department with counterparts across Government, as it has worked to ensure that SPSV operators, many of whom are self-employed, are able to access the Government's range of financial support measures to the  greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the NTA have since briefed the Committee on two occasions, giving initial feedback to the proposals and outlining progress made on their implementation. They have also briefed the Committee on the supports available to SPSV operators under the Government's July Stimulus announcement, including outlining how self-employed SPSV drivers can access measures such as grant schemes, low interest loans, and tax relief.  It is hoped that a final comprehensive response to the Committee on its proposals will be ready at the end of September. Furthermore, I expect the close co-operation with the Committee to continue for the duration of the present pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[25825\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the draft Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Transport Strategy; his views on whether the document contravenes the climate change commitments as set out in the programme for Government; his further views on whether the modal shift as proposed in the draft document is adequate; if a ministerial review of the draft document will be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The Deputy is aware that the draft Limerick Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy has been developed by the National Transport Authority, in collaboration with Limerick City and County Council, Clare County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).<\/p>  <p>  And let me first of all say I very much welcome the development of transport strategies for the major cities.

According to recent figures from the EPA, the majority of transport emissions originate from the passenger car fleet (51%), while the heavy duty freight sector accounts for 18% and vans a further 8%. Public transport (bus &amp;amp; rail) vehicles are responsible for approximately 4.5% of transport emissions.<\/p>  <p>  Maximum impact in emission savings can, therefore, be achieved in the private car and freight sectors. We must work to take emissions out of the movement of people and goods while recognising how important such movement is to our society and our economy.  The Government is, therefore, focusing primarily on:<\/p>  <p>  - Promoting a shift from private car use to public transport and active travel, while making public transport itself greener and cleaner;<\/p>  <p>  - Transitioning the private car and van fleets to alternative fuel technologies; and<\/p>  <p>  - Reducing emissions from heavy duty vehicles and the freight sector generally.<\/p>  <p>  Before COVID, the number of journeys made by public transport, walking and cycling was increasing, particularly in our capital city with 70% of all journeys into Dublin at peak morning times being made by sustainable mobility means. This was a significant increase from 59% in 2010. <\/p>  <p>  In the July Stimulus announcement, the Government showed our commitment to sustainable mobility by allocating &euro;82m to local authorities to support Covid Mobility Plans and deliver active travel infrastructure improvements across the country.  We&rsquo;ve seen some fantastic examples of improved active travel projects delivered at speed in recent months. This type of investment not only supports local businesses and communities as they reopen and adjust to the post-COVID future, it can also play a crucial role in revitalising local towns and villages. Similar supports will continue throughout the lifetime of the Government with approximately &euro;1.8 billion to be allocated toward active travel. It is our intention that the NTA will work with local authorities in developing, and, most importantly, delivering multi-annual programmes of active travel investment in the years ahead. Safe and segregated networks of walking and cycling infrastructure are fundamentally important to enable people to make the switch to active travel.<\/p>  <p>  Continued investment in increasing capacity and improving the quality of the sustainable transport systems is also critical. Under the National Development Plan, &euro;8.6 billion has been indicatively allocated over the period 2018 to 2027 to further develop sustainable mobility options, including BusConnects, DART + Programme and MetroLink as well as investment in upgrading cycling and walking infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, together with the NTA, is advancing the greening of the public transport fleet. The NDP commited to no longer buy diesel-only buses for urban public transport services. To date, Dublin Bus has entered nine diesel-electric hybrid vehicles into service in the second half of 2019, and the NTA has entered into a contract for the purchase of a further 100 double-deck hybrid buses in 2020, although this may be delayed a little due to the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis on manufacturers. My Department is also funding a number of electric public service vehicles pilot projects under the Local Link Rural Transport Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  We are also progressing the electrification of the rail system, with public consultation open on the DART+ West Project which will see the expansion of the DART out to Maynooth and the M3 Parkway. Further DART+ Projects are planned for the Connolly-Balbriggan and Heuston-Hazelhatch rail lines. A 10-year procurement framework for electric and battery-electric train units has been established. Also, the Climate Action Fund is supporting Irish Rail&rsquo;s proposed year-long trial of hybrid powering of intercity diesel trains, which, if successful, could be rolled out across the fleet. <\/p>  <p>  It is not always possible, however, to provide alternatives to the private car, especially in rural areas; the State has, therefore, provided incentives to mitigate the cost of, and encourage the transition away from, conventional fossil fuel vehicles towards lower emitting fuels and technologies. The Climate Action Plan sets a target for 936,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  Work in this space had already begun. The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established in 2016 to consider the range of measures available to accelerate the uptake of low-carbon technologies in the road transport sector. Its recommendations ahead of Budgets 2018 and 2019 resulted in the introduction of a number of measures which, together with existing incentives, formed a comprehensive suite of measures available to EV drivers, such as purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls and a home charger grant. These measures led to a significant increase in EV numbers on Irish roads, albeit from a low base. As of the end of August 2020, there were approximately 22,000 EVs under taxation in Ireland. More work is evidently required if we are to reach our Climate Action Plan targets.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the LEV Taskforce and on foot of Action 79 of the Climate Action Plan, an inter-departmental working group was established by my Department earlier this year to consider a potential roadmap to achieving the Plan's EV targets. The Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group has considered further measures, regulatory, financial and taxation, to increase the rate of EV uptake . The Working Group&rsquo;s final report will be published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in the freight sector, we are seeking to limit emissions in three key ways. Firstly, at an EU level, Ireland will continue to work to secure improved vehicle standards. Secondly, at home, we are encouraging the transition of freight fleets to alternative fuels (including electric, natural gas, biogas and hydrogen) and my Department will introduce a Low Emission Heavy Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant Scheme in early 2021 to support companies in transitioning their fleets to lower emitting alternatives. And finally, we are funding research projects considering emission mitigation measures specific to the Irish freight sector &ndash; outcomes of these studies will help to develop a strategy for a low-carbon transition, reflecting the complexities of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  This ongoing work, along with the progress we have made so far, illustrates how decarbonising the transport sector is and will remain a key priority of Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[25681\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400055#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if funding will be provided in 2021 for the upgrading of a road (details supplied) in view of its strategic importance in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

I have been particularly encouraged by how well road haulage operators have streamlined operations and promoted working time, fleet and fuel efficiencies across the industry.  Transport operators have shown a commitment to reducing emissions and have taken various initiatives including transitioning to low and zero-emission technologies. I recognise the value and vital importance of working with both sectors to support and accelerate the necessary decarbonisation of the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  To this end, my Department has engaged directly with members of the road haulage industry, including representative bodies. The establishment of the multi-stakeholder Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce in 2016 was an important initiative. The taskforce was jointly convened by the Department of Transport and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the take-up of low carbon technologies in the road transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  Following extensive stakeholder consultations, the Taskforce produced two reports, the second of which, published in November 2019, had a particular focus on the heavy duty vehicle sector. The Phase 2 report outlined a series of recommendations to Government to help accelerate the uptake of alternative fuels and technologies.  Arising from the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Taskforce recommendations, a new reduced tolling incentive regime for alternatively fuelled Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDVs) was introduced in 2020, and a new purchase grant scheme, also for alternatively-fuelled HDVs, is expected to be launched early in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the framework established by the LEV Taskforce, my Department has also worked to maintain engagement with road haulage representative bodies and operators, particularly the Freight Transport Association of Ireland (FTAI) and the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA). This has facilitated dialogue and the sharing of information between Government and industry on the challenges and opportunities associated with decarbonising the freight sector. Through site visits, and other contacts, my Department has developed a greater understanding of industry and operator-led decarbonisation issues and initiatives. These include the use of solar energy to power battery-electric goods-loading vehicles at a major Irish logistics centre; the use of CNG vehicle technologies and renewable biogas to reduce carbon emissions from waste and road transport; and the promotion of emission-reducing eco-driving techniques for Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDVs) by industry bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the scale of the decarbonisation challenge facing the Irish haulage sector, my Department has also commissioned a number of studies to identify actions that haulage operators and companies can take to reduce carbon emissions. Involving the industry, academia and public bodies, these studies examine how best to maximize the emission reduction potential of the existing HDV fleet, and to identify the most viable decarbonisation options going forward, and also, in some cases, involve consultation with  operators. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also co-funded, with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), a  freight decarbonisation study, to better understand the policy and logistics contexts within which the Irish freight industry operates, and to identify the most efficient and effective decarbonising measures for the sector in the medium to long term. To date, and despite COVID-related disruption, the project has included a series of workshops that have drawn together industry members, academia, Government Departments and agencies. The overall aim of this engagement has been to identify and co-design effective and affordable interventions that will have a meaningful impact in real-world conditions. A final project report is being prepared and is to be published by the end of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;, includes a commitment to publish and implement a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector focused on improving efficiencies and standards and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future, and my Department is beginning to undertake this important work. It is envisaged that we will carry out a public consultation, and I look forward to working with the road transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  Engagement with transport operators is of critical importance and the reduction of carbon emissions cannot be achieved without their buy-in and support. The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the lead agency for all matters of public transport and have been key promotors of the decarbonisation agenda. The NTA was a member of the steering committee for both phases of the LEV Taskforce.  A clear roadmap has been developed for the transition to low and zero-emission vehicles of the public transport fleet.  An alternative-fuels bus trial was undertaken, the results of which have informed the development of this roadmap. Recognising that all alternative fuel technologies must be explored, my Department, in conjuction with the NTA, has re-opened this trial to assess the viability of hydrogen as a fuel for our public sector fleet. My Department also has a monthly monitoring meeting with the NTA at which decarbonisation and alternative fuels is a standing item on the agenda. <\/p>  <p>  Not only are our transport operators looking to reduce carbon emissions, they are committed to reducing all emissions and the NTA is a key member of the Urban Transport Air Pollution (UTRAP) Group looking at how air pollution, in particular nitrogen oxides and particulate matters, can be reduced in urban areas, where these pollutants are most detrimental to our health.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), CI&Eacute; and Dublin Bus also participate in the Group which is seeking to identify short, medium and longer-term solutions to the reduction of transport pollutants and which is considering various options including fuel efficiencies and appropriate technologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[25677\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of plans for the N11-M11 project in north County Wicklow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":52,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network. <\/p><p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the Government's <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business<\/i>on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2-metre social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of bus and rail fleet.  Alongside this change, new Regulations were introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions. This has helped to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity.<\/p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and therefore should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so and encouraging staggered retail and office opening hours. People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services.<\/p><p>The Government's newly announced <i>Living with Covid Plan<\/i>, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  This advice along with other measures (such as continuing to work from home where possible) is aimed at suppressing the spread of Covid-19 in Ireland.

Travel to the seven countries on this list, which currently have a &lsquo;normal precautions&rsquo; (&ldquo;green&rdquo;) security status rating, are exempt from the general advice against non-essential travel overseas and the request to restrict movements does not apply to individuals arriving into Ireland from these locations. This is a positive step in opening up international travel.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also taken the decision to broadly align with the European Commission&rsquo;s co-ordinated approach to international travel, which is expected to be considered on 13 October at the General Affairs Council. With regard to countries other than those on the green list, the proposed new EU approach would involve graduated requirements for testing for incoming and outgoing passengers. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard my Department is in consultation with the Department of Health, the HSE and maritime and aviation stakeholders, to consider the possibility of introducing testing for Covid-19 in the context of international travel, as an alternative to the current restrictions, which is consistent with public health requirements and cognisant of the resources and capacity available in our health sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports measures to help mitigate the effects of the crisis on our citizens and businesses, including the aviation and maritime sectors.  These measures include the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the new Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which will now run to April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2020, the Government announced the formation of a Taskforce for Aviation Recovery, which delivered its final report on 10 July. The report, which is available on the Gov.ie web site, contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for as long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth at the appropriate time. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the broader financial supports for jobs and businesses set out in the July Stimulus package, the Government is also providing targeted supports for aviation, many of which arise from the Aviation Task Force Final Report recommendations. These are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Subvention of air services to the regions is being maintained  <\/p>  <p>  - Some &euro;2.5 million in Exchequer funding is being provided for capital investment in the areas of safety and security to the airports of Donegal, Ireland West (Knock) and Kerry  <\/p>  <p>  - A new Regional Airport Programme for the period 2020 &ndash; 2024, which will incorporate a number of support Schemes for our regional airports, is due to be published shortly<\/p>  <p>  - Shannon Airport has been given an emergency grant of &euro;6.1m to enable the Airport to complete its Hold Baggage Screen project &ndash; which is a safety and security requirement under EU Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  - Legislation has been introduced to provide a State-guarantee for Refund Credit Notes issued to the customers of Irish licensed travel agents and tour operators who have had to cancel holiday bookings.  This guarantee ensures that where a Credit Note is accepted by a customer then its monetary value will be secured until such times as it is used in the future.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also examining how best to help secure the future of the Shannon Group, including the Airport, and in this regard it is proposed that a Memorandum for Government will be submitted in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Other recommendations, including further targeted financial supports to help reinstate connectivity, regional development and sustainability in the aviation sector, are being developed by my Department.  This work will feed into the Government&rsquo;s further plans to re-launch international connectivity and to aid broader economic recovery at the appropriate time, while being cognisant of prevailing public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  The maritime sector is essential to the continued supply of goods coming in and out of the country, accounting as it does, for 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s international trade in volume terms. It is, therefore, vitally important to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s ports, shipping operations and all the elements of that maritime supply chain continue to function.<\/p>  <p>  In the earlier part of the year my Department provided for a financial intervention by way of the designation of five key strategic routes as public service obligation routes.  This measure was taken in order to maintain continuity of service and to mitigate against some of the financial impacts of the crisis. However, as freight volumes have recovered somewhat and the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; element has now gone, this measure has now been discontinued. My Department continues to explore all avenues available in terms of supports to ensure our strategic maritime routes are maintained. As we move to align ourselves more closely with the EU position on a more co-ordinated approach to international travel, I am confident that the clarity being provided will help in restoring consumer confidence in the maritime sector.   <\/p>  <p>  I and my officials have met stakeholders in both the aviation and maritime sectors and will continue to engage with them to determine what measures we can put in place to assist these sectors. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[25673\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will allocate the funds required for a feasibility study on the Navan to Kingscourt rail line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's similar question yesterday, I am informed that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann (I&Eacute;) has no current plans to reopen this line, nor to undertake a feasibility study at this time.

The Taskforce report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been badly affected by the huge reductions in international passengers travelling by air due to the travel restrictions which remain in place on public health grounds. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right.

Shannon Group is availing of these supports which are designed to assist businesses, including our airports, in terms of the management of their companies during this unprecedented time.<\/p>  <p>  The Aviation Recovery Taskforce set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The Taskforce report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been particularly badly hit by the crisis. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right. The Government has already implemented several recommendations, including the publication of safe air travel protocols and the progression of the European slot rule waiver for airlines in consultation with the European Commission.  The wage subsidy scheme was also extended to April 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The other recommendations, including further targeted financial supports to help reinstate connectivity (including for Shannon Airport), regional development and sustainability in the sector are being examined by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 specifically addresses the approach to international travel and proposes that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission&rsquo;s recently published proposal to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU\/EEA.  This proposal will now be considered by the Council of Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  As already mentioned, Shannon Airport is part of Shannon Group, which operates in both the aviation and tourism sectors and as such has been particularly severely affected by the impact by Covid19.  For this reason I committed to undertaking an examination of Shannon Group.  This review is currently underway in my Department and I will bring recommendations to Government in this regard in order to secure the future of the company. <\/p>  <p>  It is my intention that the Company, including Shannon Airport, will be well positioned for the future particularly given the importance of Shannon Airport to the economy of the Midwest region and indeed nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB03650"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[22243\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to deal with the issue of illegally driven scrambler bikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>The legislation under my remit in relation to the regulation of scrambler bikes, quad bikes and other similar small vehicles, falls under Road Traffic legislation, and relates solely to their use in a public place.  It does not extend to private property, or to public parks which are under the jurisdiction of local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Scrambler motorbikes, quadbikes and other small similar vehicles, are mechancially propelled vehicles, which means that they are vehicles intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical power.  As such, irrespective of engine capacity, under Road Traffic legislation, the user of a scrambler motorbike, a quad bike or similar vehicle, in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, and must also wear a helmet, with severe penalties under the road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements.  It is also, incidentally, and offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a minor. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; means any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.  Road traffic law does not extend to the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on private property.  Certain places, such as parks under the control of local authorities, can be subject to bye-laws, which those authorities have the power to introduce, to prohibit the use of vehicles.  Gardai can also prosecute scrambler and quad bike users in these areas under public order laws.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Department of Justice convened a task force comprising representatives from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice, my Department, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to examine the current legislative provisions in place and to examine whether further laws need to be enacted to deal with the problem of quads and scramblers.  <\/p>  <p>  The taskforce concluded that there is a wide suite of legislation available to an Garda Siochana, including road traffic legislation (for using these vehicles illegally in a public place), and public order legislation (for using them on public land).  There is no jurisdiction for using quads or scramblers on private land.  Consideration was given to whether an extension of the concept of 'public place' in the Road Traffic Acts to cover parks would assist in this area.  However, it was concluded following legal advice that the extension of such a fundamental concept in road traffic law in an attempt to address one particular issue would have wide-ranging unintended consequences, and would not be a viable solution.<\/p>  <p>  The Task Force has since met to consider other more precise legal avenues, and will be meeting again shortly to follow up on the options being considered.  Any solution will need to involve a combination of legisaltion - whether new or existing - enforcement, public awareness campaigns, and approaches to local youth groups, to educate teens on the dangers of using such vehicles.  I will be happy to consider any recommendations resulting from this process which fall within my remit.<\/p>  <p>  I would add that, whatever the legislation and whether we are talking of a 'public place' or a park, there remains a major difficulty of enforcement.  A Garda giving chase to a youth on a scrambler must be mindful of the safety of other members of the public in the area, and this makes it more difficult to detain the scrambler drivers, whatever the legislation in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB03850"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[25880\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of plans for the electrification of the bus and rail fleet.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[25667\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400056#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the proposal in the Programme for Government for new buses to be electric or hybrid after 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 55 together.<\/p><p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.<\/p><p>At a policy level, the Deputy has highlighted the <i>Programme for Government<\/i>commitment that all new urban buses be electric or electric hybrid and I am glad to say that commitment is built into this year's bus purchase programme and obviously remains an integral part of all future bus purchase programmes.<\/p><p>Again at a policy level, in terms of the potential, or further, electrification of the rail network there are three important strands to that - <\/p><p>- extension of the existing DART network as part of the DART+ programme;<\/p><p>- future introduction of electrified services on the Cork commuter network as set out in the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Study; and<\/p><p>- options for the major inter-urban network which will be considered as part of an imminent Departmental-led major review of speeds on the Belfast-Dublin-Limerick Junction-Cork line <\/p><p>In terms of the current status of the bus purchase programme, DART+ programme and roll-out of the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy I have referred your question to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for direct reply.

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>As of 15 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 21 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. <\/p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. <\/p><p>The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates\u00a0through\u00a0its website (<i><\/i>).<\/p><p>I am advised that in Co Clare surveys have\u00a0recently commenced\u00a0in the areas of Cratloe, Ballycannan, Ballyglass and Cloghrea and further surveys are due to commence in the areas of Kilkishen before the end of this year. \u00a0<\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

Further details can be found at\u00a0<i><\/i>. <\/p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network.

Since its launch in 2018, almost 90 SPSV drivers have availed of the grant and changed to an electric vehicle. The first zero-emission wheelchair accessible taxi in Ireland was also purchased with assistance from this grant scheme. In addition, my Department is currently funding the installation of SPSV-dedicated EV chargers at Dublin and Cork airports and train stations in Dublin, Cork and Limerick to help support the sector in moving to electric.<\/p><p>Similarly, progress is being made to decarbonise our rail network. Significant electrification is envisaged, with proposed expansion of the DART out to Balbriggan, Maynooth\/M3 Parkway and Hazelhatch.A 10-year procurement framework for electric and battery-electric train units has also been established and the <i>Climate Action Fund<\/i>is supporting Irish Rail in a year-long trial of hybrid powered intercity diesel trains, which, if successful, could be rolled out across the fleet. <\/p><p>It is estimated that the entire public transport system accounts for fewer than 5% of all land transport emissions; nevertheless, I am committed to reducing this further due to the important leadership role the sector can play in Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation effort. Greening public transport will remain a key priority for the Department of Transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400058#WRD06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400058#WRD06700"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[26246\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400058#WRD06800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he can assist the transport sector to recover after Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>Measures implemented with regard to travel restrictions, due to Covid-19, are decided by Government as a whole, based on public health advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team.<\/p><p>I and my Departmental officials are working continuously to develop and implement measures in order to keep our vital transport networks moving, and to ensure the ongoing operation and viability of the transport sector Since my appointment as Minister for Transport in June, I have met with stakeholders in all transport sectors and will continue to engage with them to determine what measures can be put in place to assist the sectors. Any such measures will feed into the Government&rsquo;s aim to support the transport sector and aid broader economic recovery, while being cognisant of prevailing public health advice.<\/p><p>The Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports measures to help mitigate the effects of the crisis on our citizens and businesses, including those working in the transport sector.  These measures include the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the new Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which will now run to April 2021.<\/p><p>In addition to the broader financial supports for jobs and businesses set out in the July Stimulus package, the Government is also providing targeted supports for the transport sector. <\/p><p>In relation to the Maritime and Aviation sectors of Transport I refer the Deputy to <b>Dail Question No.35<\/b>, which outlines a number of specific and targeted measures taken by my Department to assist both of these sectors, which are in addition to the broader financial supports set out in the July Stimulus package. <\/p><p>With regard to other transport sectors, which are within the remit of my Department, the specific measures and supports being provided to assist in mitigating the effects of Covid-19 are outlined below.<\/p><p>Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society and is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping, public services, and social engagement. Targeted supports for this sector include: <\/p><p>- A substantial increase in the 2020 budget for the existing Public Service Obligation (PSO) service;<\/p><p>- The introduction of new temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators;<\/p><p>- The introduction of mandatory face coverings on public transport to enable greater numbers of passengers to use services and<\/p><p>- The introduction of enhancements to certain PSO bus services as announced under the Stimulus package.<\/p><p>The Government has worked closely with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (SPSVs) to take action to support the industry and reduce the costs of operators from the very start of the pandemic. The industry&rsquo;s statutory regulator, the National Transport Authority (NTA), has provided a number of measures to assist the sector, including:<\/p><p>- extending licences that were due to expire between 13 March and 12 June of this year;<\/p><p>- working with the insurance industry to facilitate the suspension of SPSV insurance for operators who decided to stop working and chose to suspend their licences;<\/p><p>- waiving late renewal fees through to March  2021, effectively allowing operators to stop operating for up to one year without facing any undue cost for doing so and<\/p><p>- extending vehicle age limits for vehicles that were due to reach those limits between March and December this year.<\/p><p>Given the importance of the work of our road haulage sector during these difficult times, my Department implemented a number of measures to support the continued functioning of the sector in recent months, including:<\/p><p>- A prolonged temporary derogation from certain provisions of the EU driving and rest hours rules (which expired at the end of May);<\/p><p>- The extension of expiry dates on driver Certificate of Professional Competence cards (of a maximum of six months up to the 26th September 2020) and  <\/p><p>- The extension of validity periods for driver licences.<\/p><p>A number of communications have also been issued to help support the freight sector including:<\/p><p>- Guidance to all supply chain workers stating that they are exempt from self-restricting movements on their return to Ireland, as long as they are not displaying symptoms of COVID-19;<\/p><p>A communication regarding Access to Sanitary Facilities and Motorway Services;<\/p><p>- A summary of Motorway Service Area Facilities; <\/p><p>- Communication on the Importance of all Essential Workers at Every Level in the Supply Chain; and<\/p><p>- Publication of Guidelines for Cleaning HGVs.<\/p><p>In addition, in line with the EU&rsquo;s &ldquo;Green Lanes&rdquo; guidance, HGV drivers are exempt from the requirement to complete the Passenger Locator Form.<\/p><p>In line with the roadmap published by the Government for re-opening the economy, local authorities and contractors resumed general roadworks operations on regional and local roads from the 18th of May this year. These works have been undertaken on the basis of safe working arrangements which involved establishing site specific and activity specific operating procedures in line with published public health guidance.<\/p><p>On foot of the Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus package, over &euro;30m was allocated by the Department&rsquo;s Regional and Local Roads Division to local authorities on the 31 August, 2020 for Active Travel Measures. These include measures to support pedestrians and cyclists in urban and rural areas and to improve accessibility, and over &euro;10 milion for Climate Change Adaptation Works\/Repairs. This funding will allow 531 active travel projects to be completed this year under this programme.  <\/p><p>Due to the Covid pandemic the Road Safety Authority (RSA) had to close many services in the interest of public health, including in particular, the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS), National Car Test (NCT), Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Testing (CVRT), Driver Testing and Driver Theory Test services.<\/p><p>As a result of these closures, the validity periods of the following documents, in cases where they were due to expire between 1 March and 30 June 2020 inclusive, were extended by four months -  <\/p><p>- Learner permits<\/p><p>- Driving licences<\/p><p>- Driver theory test certificates<\/p><p>- Certificate of competency (issued when a person has passed a driving test)<\/p><p>- Certificates of motorcycle training<\/p><p>In addition, the requirement for those over 70 to provide a medical report when applying for or renewing a driving licence or learner permit was removed. This provision, granted in March and extended in July, means that since 20 March and until 31 December 2020, persons of 70 years of age or over, can apply for and renew their driving licence or learner permit without the need to submit a medical report as long as they do not have an identified or specified illness.<\/p><p>The National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) resumed its services on 8 June 2020. Due to Covid 19 related disruption of services, learner permits and driving licences were further extended as follows: <\/p><p>- Learner permits that expired or are due to expire between 1 March and 31 October 2020 were extended by 8 months and <\/p><p>- driving licences that expired between 1 March  and 31 August 2020 were extended by 7 months.<\/p><p>The RSA, which operates the NDLS on behalf of the Department, continues to work with its providers to see how capacity can be increased within the NDLS while adhering to the return to work protocol.  The RSA also hopes to extend its online services over the coming months, subject to the appropriate legislation and technical solutions being in place. <\/p><p>A 4-month extension has been provided for National Car Test (NCT) due dates and a 3-month extension for Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT) due dates.  The CVRT service resumed on 18 May and the NCT service resumed on a phased basis from 8 June 2020 with all test centres in the network having resumed testing by 20 July 2020. <\/p><p>The Driver Theory Testing service reopened on 8 June and the driver testing service reopened from 29 June for some vehicles, and 16 July for all others, including cars.  <\/p><p>Capacity in the Theory Test system since resumption is actually increased on pre-Covid but the scale of backlog combined with the time of year, when many school-leavers will apply, means increased waiting lists.  The RSA is working with the service provider to see how capacity can be further increased.  The capacity of the driving test has been reduced, while a large backlog has developed.  My Department has already approved retention and hire of a number of temporary testers to assist in the situation.  <\/p><p>The RSA has submitted a comprehensive plan for addressing the demands on the service, which is being considered in my Department, having regard to public health and safety issues.  <\/p><p>The EU introduced Regulation (EU) 2020\/698 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 2020, in order to, inter alia, minimise disruption and ensure a continuous flow of goods within the EU.  As a result, drivers with valid Irish Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) cards that were due to expire between 1 February and 31 August 2020 were granted an extension of seven months on their expiring card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400058#WRD06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400058#WRD07000"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[26247\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400058#WRD07100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans regarding the upgrading of the national road network in areas throughout the country that have not benefited from such enhancement in the past with particular reference to the need to ensure an adequate and reliable network for commercial transport both throughout the island of Ireland and gaining access to European markets in the wake of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

These measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements, and included a loan payment break of up to three months which was subsequently extended for up to a six month period.<\/p>  <p>  The financial circumstances of many of the borrowers that availed of a Covid-19 payment break have now normalised and they are in a position to return to making payments.  In that regard, the BPFI has indicated that the broad options available to borrowers coming off a payment break will be to return to payments over the existing term of the loan, or to extend the term of the loan so as to make the monthly repayments more affordable for the borrower.  It is important that lenders and borrowers coming off a payment break engage so as to select the most appropriate new repayment arrangement in their individual case.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, at the end of a payment beak there will be some borrowers who will continue to experience financial difficulty.  In these circumstances, it will be particularly important that engagement should take place as early as possible.  I would, therefore, encourage any borrower who feels he or she may have difficulty in resuming payments after a Covid-19 payment break to contact their lender and if possible to do so before the payment break end date.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations, under the Central Bank consumer protection framework, to support and work with borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears. In particular, lenders are obliged to engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate and sustainable solution having regard to the particular circumstances of a case and that lenders should use the full suite of restructuring solutions available to them.  In that regard, while the European Banking Authority has recently stated that it would not extend its 30 September closing date to qualify for a Covid-19 payment break, it has also made it clear that banks can continue to support their customers with an extended payment break after 30 September on a case by case basis with such loans classified according to the normal prudential framework.<\/p>  <p>  I will make it clear, in my on-going engagement with individual banks and with the representatives of the banking industry, that banks should work with and pro-actively assist their customers who will still be experiencing difficulty at the end of a Covid-19 payment break and I will also work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support following a Covid-19 payment break.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this overall engagement, it is important to highlight that, as Minister for Finance, I cannot mandate or overrule the internal decision making processes in any individual bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding, including decisions in relation to Covid-19 payment breaks and the decisions individual banks may make at the end of a Covid-19 payment break. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.  However, all banks, including those in which I have a shareholding interest, will have to fully comply with all the applicable Central Bank and other consumer protection requirements that apply to all Central Bank regulated banks and mortgage lenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400059#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400059#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[26076\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400059#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a series of matters raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) will be given consideration; the steps that will be taken to alleviate the inability of cross-Border workers to work from home due to double taxation legislation; if steps will be taken to remove the double taxation rules to allow persons here working in the Northern Ireland a better work life balance (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that Transborder Relief may apply in the case of an individual resident in the State but who commutes to his or her place of work outside the State.

I am eager to get our musicians, our performers and all their behind-the-scenes technical support people back to earning a living and doing what they do so well. <\/p>  <p>  In announcing members of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, I have included representation from the Events Industry Alliance. The Taskforce will prepare a report including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  I look forward to receiving the Taskforce report in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing live performance promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view.  I was pleased to have recently announced a new fund that will assist established commercial venues and promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians, creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance.   <\/p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; under my Department which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The scheme will help to de-risk the costs of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. This scheme is open to applications until 1pm on the 25th September and I hope to announce the recipients of this funding in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  A further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.<\/p>  <p>  The music support schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[26124\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the sports capital grant scheme will open in 2020 for applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.

Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April with 6 new allocations approved. The priority to date this year has been to advance all of these projects to ensure the facilities are available for use and that the relevant grants are drawn down.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to future grants, following the finalisation of the appeals process, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP was undertaken. This Review has now been complete and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review. Work on these terms and conditions is now being finalised and a new round of the programme will be open for applications before the end of the year with an announcement in this regard expected in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[26010\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the Cork events centre.","asker":"1460","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>The Cork Event Centre is included as a commitment under Project Ireland 2040 and it underlines the Government&rsquo;s objectives around urban regeneration, enhanced amenity and heritage, associated quality of life standards, balanced regional development, and the regeneration and development of Cork City Centre. <\/p><p>It was agreed in the context of Budget 2020 that responsibility at central Government level for making the grant aid support available for the project would transfer to my Department.

It is a relief that there are no reported deaths or injuries, but the very sudden displacement of thousands of people, including children, has caused great suffering and created a major humanitarian emergency as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the COVID pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart on 9 September immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities have requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from our humanitarian logistics base in Brindisi, Italy. The Greek authorities have thanked us for our offer of assistance and we now stand ready to respond to a request for the deployment of emergency humanitarian supplies.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. On 23 September 2020, the Commission published a major new proposal on reforming the EU migration and asylum system - a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;. I welcome the release of this Pact and the renewed impetus that it will give to arriving at an agreed common approach to this difficult issue. We need to find more sustainable solutions involving consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. Ireland is committed to continue to work with our EU partners to resolve these issues. In the meantime, it is essential that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met by all Member States.<\/p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. We have also committed to accept 36 unaccompanied minors in need of international protection in Greece, and I was pleased that the first group of eight such minors arrived in Ireland last June. In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided to accept another group of four unaccompanied minors, as part of this overall commitment, and is continuing to keep under review what further actions it can take to meet the enormous humanitarian and relocation needs arising from this tragic event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF06200"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[26077\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400060#WRF06300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the highlighting by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the lack of respect by Spain for international bodies with regard to the situation in Catalonia; the steps Ireland can take to impress on the Spanish authorities the need to respect international law in relation to the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>My Department follows developments in Spain closely and I am aware of the United Nations Working Group to which the question refers.<\/p><p>I maintain contacts with my Spanish counterparts on a range of issues, including the situation in Catalonia.

With less than 100 days to go until the end of the Brexit transition period, it is vital that businesses step up their preparations for the range of changes that will definitively take place on 1 January, 2020.  From that date the UK will be outside the Single Market and Customs Union and this will have profound and immediate implications for every business who moves goods to, from or through Great Britain. <\/p>  <p>  Government Departments, enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies have made available a range of business supports, including financial, upskilling, and advisory supports to assist in preparing for the end of the Brexit transition period.  More information on these supports, including to businesses in the border counties, is available in the Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan.  <\/p>  <p>  The Border Enterprise Development Fund (BEDF) was launched in January, to assist businesses in the border region.  The BEDF is administered by Enterprise Ireland and provides support for collaborative, enterprise capability building projects, to advance entrepreneurship, productivity and innovation in the border region. The aim of the fund is to improve the international competitiveness of enterprise in the border region in the context of Brexit and other market challenges,  which now also includes COVID-19.  The Fund is part of a &euro;28 million economic stimulus package announced earlier this year for the six border counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the EU and the UK and will apply in all scenarios from 1 January 2021, ensuring that many of the changes arising in our trade with Great Britain will not apply to trade with Northern Ireland.  The Common Travel Area will also continue to operate as it does today.<\/p>  <p>  Together with EU partners, the Government is closely monitoring developments in relation to the UK Internal Markets Bill.  We have outlined to the UK Government our very strong concerns about the Bill.  Any unilateral departure from the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Trade connectivity between Ireland and continental Europe, both via the landbridge across the UK and via direct routes, is of major strategic importance to Irish businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The efficient and effective functioning of the UK landbridge is a priority for Government.

Businesses should also be aware that ports will experience delays following the end of the transition period with Dover-Calais identified as a likely bottleneck.<\/p>  <p>  These new procedures will not apply to goods that move directly to the continent. The Government remains in contact with shipping companies regarding direct maritime connectivity to continental Europe, including through Rosslare Europort.  In consultations with shipping companies, they have indicated that sufficient capacity is in place on direct routes and that they expect to be able to respond to any additional demand for direct services.  So far this year, we have already seen a number of new direct services commenced from Irish ports to continental ports, including a new service from Rosslare Europort to Bilbao. <\/p>  <p>  Where feasible, traders moving goods to or from EU markets through the UK should consider direct maritime services as an alternative to the UK landbridge.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.<\/p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.<\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.  <\/p>  <p>  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process is also outside of the scope of the appeals process.<\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a searate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.  <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will also have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400061#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400061#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[26033\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400061#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when after-school facilities such as homework clubs may open in schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The position is that decisions on the use of school facilities lies with the relevant school authority in consultation with the property owner and priority has to be given to the interests of the school, teachers and pupils.<\/p><p>My Department's policy is to encourage the use of school facilities, where possible, for community, training and education related activities such as homework clubs.

This unique three-pillar approach was developed in close consultation with agencies, stakeholders, provider representative bodies and social partners.<\/p>  <p>  These guides have since been supplemented by Implementation Guidelines developed by experts within the higher education sector, and endorsed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, published on August 5th.  These guidelines can be further updated and modified as the public health situation evolves.<\/p>  <p>  Both our own guidance for returning to on-site activity and the Implementation Guidelines state that social distancing of 2 metres should be maintained where possible.. However it is recognised that there will be circumstances under which tuition cannot realistically be delivered while maintaining 2m distance between students, and the Implementation Guidelines include provisions for reduced social distancing in certain situations with clearly specified mitigation measures such as the wearing of face coverings to minimise the risk of viral transmission. The full range of recommended mitigation measures are clearly outlined in the Implementation Guidelines and all of the measures are directed at ensuring the safety of staff and students. The overarching priority of all involved is to safeguard public health in the return to on-campus learning.<\/p>  <p>  It is not intended for my Department to review or approve specific measures put in place by individual institutions. The diversity and flexibility of the Higher Education sector has been key in driving responsive and adaptable approaches to the challenges created by the pandemic.

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The plan is framed to account for periods which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.<\/p><p>Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. Any measure included at any level in this plan is underpinned by expert advice and recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another.

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.<\/p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. <\/p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme is currently working on a document which will issue to all maternity services, seeking to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions in maternity  hospitals, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.  I am advised that the paper will issue over the coming week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK06700"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[26032\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK06800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider the pre-budget submission from an organisation (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>Protection of the vulnerable continues to be a Government priority, especially in these challenging times, and those with mental health issues are often among the most vulnerable in society. <\/p><p>Access to services is central to the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Sl&aacute;intecare and the new national mental health policy, <i>Sharing the Vision,<\/i>and the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future highlights these policies. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.<\/p><p>Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland is fortunate to have fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas<i>,<\/i>including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life. <\/p><p><i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.<\/p><p><i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.<\/p><p>Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.<\/p><p>This year has been exceptional. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world, from the disease itself and from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.<\/p><p>The HSE has continued to provide all community services, as far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure protection for patients and staff. Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.<\/p><p>Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and well-being, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports and to support the HSE psycho-social strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the<i><\/i>free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for front line workers from Turn2me.<\/p><p>A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020.<\/p><p>Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.<\/p><p>Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of <i>Sharing the Vision. <\/i>This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK07000"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[26034\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK07100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are research teams or research clinics set up to treat and research the conditions those recovering from Covid-19, post-covid19 infection are suffering, including but not solely chronic fatigue; if there is medical research ongoing, the detail of the different research and treatment facilities and teams; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[26035\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK07200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the person or body responsible for the treatment and research into the ongoing health complications of patients who are post-Covid 19 infection; the types of conditions being examined for inclusion in post-Covid-19 treatments and research; the locations the research and treatment is being conducted from; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[26036\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK07300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE or another organisation is researching the conditions affecting patients post-Covid-19 infection; if they are being considered as post viral fatigue syndrome patients; if so, if they can be examined at a later date to ascertain if they are possibly suffering from ME as a result of Covid-19 infection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 to 233, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department plays a lead role in public health and medical research in Ireland. The Department supports research in these areas through the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory body under the aegis of the Department and a lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. The HRB supports the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials (in addition to health services research, population health research, and managing several national health information systems) on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the long-term impact of COVID-19 we are still at an early stage post wave one infection, and there is a need for patients to be followed for a further period of time to understand conditions that are a long-term consequence of COVID-19 infection. There are several studies underway of note for which the Lead Investigators responsible, study details, and sites are provided. <\/p>  <p>  Led by Professor Colm Bergin, a study at St. James Hospital is currently evaluating patients clinically post infection and in the context of an emerging disease undertaking research of outcomes in the patients reviewed to date, and including fatigue experienced and quality-of-life for a cohort of the patients seen to date. <\/p>  <p>  The HRB currently funds a project on improving healthcare delivery for COVID-19 patients in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city: The North Dublin COVID-19 Cohort Study. The research is led by Dr John Lambert and Professor Walter Cullen of University College Dublin and the study site includes the Mater Hospital and surrounding GP practices. The North Dublin COVID-19 Cohort Study was established in April 2020 and researches the health of these patients and the long-term impact of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  By analysing healthcare information about patients attending the Mater Hospital and general practices with COVID-19, and by involving consenting patients in follow-up studies, it will capture important insights into the health experience of people living in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city during the pandemic and will provide reports to the HSE and other health agencies. In this way, it will help to plan health services according to the needs of this at-risk population and reduce the negative effect of the pandemic on local communities. The study is not limited to specific patient groups or people with specific health conditions, or specific long-term health outcomes. This study may, therefore, in the long-term capture the conditions of interest to the Deputy.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on behalf of the Irish Government, the Department of Health is providing funding of up to &euro;2.5 million to enable participation in the SOLIDARITY Trial. The SOLIDARITY Trial is an international clinical trial launched by the World Health Organisation and partners to compare various treatment options for COVID-19. The trial will enable the identification of treatments that will reduce the severity of the infection, decrease the need for intensive care and reduce the infection&rsquo;s mortality rate. <\/p>  <p>  The WHO SOLIDARITY Trial is one of only a few large, international, multicentre trials for COVID-19 treatments. Importantly, it has an adaptive design so WHO decide to cease treatment arms or to introduce new treatment arms if they feel that emerging evidence on safety and efficacy warrants this. Globally, the SOLIDARITY Trial has recruited over 5,000 patients to date, in over 400 hospitals and across 35 countries, with another 100 countries awaiting approval to participate in the trial. Eligibility to participate in the trial is not limited to specific patient groups or with specific conditions, instead all patients aged 18+ who are confirmed COVID-19 positive are eligible to be enrolled in the trial and this may therefore, overtime, include people with the health conditions of interest to the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  For the SOLIDARITY Trial in Ireland, there are 10 trial sites (6 main University-based Clinical Research Facilities and Centres and their affiliated hospitals: Beaumont Hospital; Cork University Hospital; Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; Mercy University Hospital; St James's Hospital; St Vincent's University Hospital; Tallaght University Hospital; University Hospital Galway; University Hospital Limerick; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital). Recruitment of patients to the trial is underway and will continue through to Spring 2021. Professor Joe Eustace of University College Cork is the lead investigator for the trial. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the REMAP CAP trial will shortly start enrolling patients in Irish intensive care units. Conducted at clinical research facilities and centres across Ireland and led by Professor Alistair Nichol of St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and University College Dublin, the trial will test interventions for COVID-19 in critically ill patients in order to mitigate the long-term impact of COVID-19 for them and reduce mortality. The trial will capture outcomes and analyse data across an international network in a global effort to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in intensive care settings. Rapid data sharing will ensure findings relevant to the COVID-19 outbreak are shared quickly with others working in the area to inform decision making. As part of the trial, the Irish arm recently published results showing that the common steroid hydrocortisone, administered to critically unwell patients in intensive care units, reduced the mortality rate from 40% to 32%.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400064#WRK07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":651,"content":"<p>Question No. 232 answered with Question No. 231.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":653,"content":"<p>Question No. 233 answered with Question No. 231.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400065#WRL00300"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[26039\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400065#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current waiting times for consultations with audiologists in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400065#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400065#WRL00600"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[26040\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400065#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the inequalities that exist between professional psychology doctoral training courses; and if there are plans to address this by funding both the educational and counselling psychology doctoral courses in line with clinical psychology doctorates.","asker":"1563","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, this is a matter for the Health Service Executive.

If Public Health determines there is an outbreak, an Outbreak Control Team is convened who would then advise on control measures. <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; which was published on 9 May, 2020 by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol is mandatory, and it applies to all workplaces right across the economy. Specific sectors may need to introduce additional safeguards, but this document sets out the standard set of measures to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. It is a matter for the employer to make decisions relating to actions to be taken in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a workplace. This should be described in the COVID-19 Response Plan to be developed by all employers and which is a requirement of the Protocol.<\/p>  <p>  The National Standing Oversight Committee on Cases and Outbreaks of COVID-19 in High Risk settings - Food Processing and Construction sector was established in August 2020 to maintain an ongoing review of the impact of COVID-19 in high risk industries. The membership of this Committee includes relevant Government Departments and Agencies to ensure a cross Government approach is taken to such sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400066#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400066#WRM01600"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[26178\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400066#WRM01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a procedure for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year.

This is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government as the National Parks and Wildlife Service falls under the remit of that Department<\/p><p>However, there are a number of issues which are of direct relevance to the area-based schemes implemented by my Department in order to provide support to farmers.  <\/p><p>Eligibility for payments under EU funded area-based schemes such as the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme is established under Article 32.1 of Regulation 1307\/2013 which provides that &ldquo;Support under the basic payment scheme shall be granted to farmers,  ....... upon activation of a payment entitlement per eligible hectare ....&rdquo;<\/p><p>The definition of an eligible hectare is set out in article 32.2.(a)  and (b) of this regulation.  An eligible hectare is defined as  (a)  &ldquo;any <i>agricultural area<\/i>of the holding,  ........ that is used for an <i>agricultural activity<\/i>or, where the area is also used for non-agricultural activities, is predominantly used for agricultural activities&rdquo; and  (b) &ldquo;any area which gave a right to payments in 2008 under the single payment scheme ... and no longer complies with the definition of 'eligible hectare' under point (a) as a result of the implementation of Directive 92\/43\/EEC, Directive 2000\/60\/EC and Directive 2009\/147\/EC.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Article 4.1.(c) provides the definition of an agricultural activity as &ldquo;(i) production, rearing or growing of agricultural products, including harvesting, milking, breeding animals, and keeping animals for farming purposes, (ii) maintaining an agricultural area in a state which makes it suitable for grazing or cultivation without preparatory action going beyond usual agricultural methods and machineries, based on criteria established by Member States on the basis of a framework established by the Commission&rdquo;<\/p><p>Article 4.1.(e) of that regulation provides a definition of agricultural area as &ldquo; any area taken up by arable land, permanent grassland and permanent pasture, or permanent crops&rdquo;.<\/p><p>With regard to 4.1 (c) (ii), Ireland has defined that the usual agricultural methods and machineries are topping, spraying, mulching and legal burning. <\/p><p>In determining the area of land eligible for payment under the relevant area based schemes, the Department deducts ineligible features from the gross area of the parcel. These include non-agricultural area (e.g. raised bog and areas that are too wet for animals or machinery to access), fenced off areas, hard features like buildings and rock, and the area of the parcel that is covered in scrub or other non-forage vegetation. In addition any land where there is no agricultural activity (abandoned land) is deducted. <\/p><p>Where a farmer claims on land in an area protected under Directive 92\/43\/EEC, and\/or Directive 2009\/147\/EC, payment is made on such land where it is agricultural land, with an agricultural activity and where it gave right to a payment and was claimed for payment in 2008.  For this land, non agricultural areas along with hard features are deducted. The area covered in scrub or other non forage vegetations within the parcel is also deducted unless &ldquo;Activities Requiring Consent&rdquo; (ARCs) for Special Protection Areas or &ldquo;Notifiable Actions&rdquo;  (NAs) for Special Areas of Conservation specifically forbid the cutting or removal of such vegetation. In addition, the area that was covered in ineligible features in 2008 is also deducted as these areas could not give a right to payment in 2008.<\/p><p>The habitats that are protected under these EU directives developed over a long period of time in conjunction with agricultural activities, which also sustained economically important farming activities and in most cases they require agricultural activities in order to be sustained as habitats. Payment may only be made for parcels with no agricultural activity in cases where the ARCs or NAs prevent the farmer carrying on an agricultural activity. In all other cases where there is no agricultural activity payment cannot be made as set out in article 32 of regulation 1307\/3023.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that one of the four objectives of the Green, Low, Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) administered by my Department is to contribute to positive environmental management of farmed Natura 2000 sites and river catchments in the implementation of the EU Directives in question. This is achieved through compensating farmers for actions such as Farmland Habitat (Private Natura) where applicants manage the land to avoid farming practices that cause environmental damage and protect vulnerable habitats such as wetlands, which in turn helps to safeguard animals and plants which occupy them. This action may also be chosen in conjunction with any of the Farmland Bird, Bat or Bee actions also available under GLAS.<\/p><p>In relation to the part of the questions relating the work of the Agriculture Appeals Office (AAO), I wish to inform the Deputy that the AAO operates independently of my Department. The Director and the Appeals Officers carry out their functions in accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 and the Agriculture Appeals Regulations 2002.  There are distinct and specific statutory functions assigned to the officials delivering the appeals service which require the Appeals Officers and the Director under law to be independent in the performance of their functions when making determinations on appeals made by affected persons against decisions taken by the Department. <\/p><p>Appeals Officers are required to have regard to the principles of natural justice and to comply with the terms and conditions and EU regulations applying to the Department schemes when considering and making decisions on appeals.  I have been advised by the Director that she is satisfied that the Agriculture Appeals Office is carrying out its functions as required under the governing legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400067#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Issues","counter":797,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400067#WRN00600"},{"type":"question","counter":798,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[26021\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092400067#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of hectares of farmland that have been lost to erosion and notified to his Department via changes in land parcel information by county in tabular form; if he will consider a scheme to assist farmers whose land is affected by erosion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":799,"content":"<p>The issue of coastal erosion is primarily one for the Local Authorities who have mitigation and control plans in place.<\/p><p>The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is the mapping system used by my Department to manage the various area-based farmer schemes that it operates such as the Basic Payment Scheme, Greening and the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme.<\/p><p>My Department updates the land parcel boundaries on the LPIS when land ceases to be involved in agricultural production.

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. <\/p><p>Two issues have now arisen<\/p><p>1.  The new requirement under EU Law for a veterinary prescription to be issued before antiparasitic products can be dispensed and<\/p><p>2.  The question as to whether Ireland can avail of a derogation in the Regulation which permits professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions. <\/p><p>In relation to the first issue, since 2004 European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006\/130\/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.<\/p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019\/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed. In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019\/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website www.hpra.ie.<\/p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019\/6. Therefore antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022. Ireland has no national discretion on this issue.<\/p><p>On the second issue, there is a separate derogation in the Regulation, which allows professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions, in limited circumstances, but only if this was provided for in a Member State's national legislation prior to Regulation 2019\/6 coming into force in January 2019.<\/p><p>Ireland's national legislation has never permitted anyone other than a veterinarian to issue a veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland has no national discretion to now provide for a regime which would permit Responsible Persons in Licensed Merchants or pharmacists to dispense antiparasitic veterinary medicines without a veterinary prescription issued by a veterinarian.<\/p><p>I recognise these legislative changes will result in challenges for all impacted stakeholders. In recognition of this, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer. Two meetings have been held to date and a programme of work containing over 30 antiparasitic related projects is currently underway. This group will examine all the issues related to the changed route of supply with two principal objectives <\/p><p>-  Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.<\/p><p>-  Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers<\/p><p>My Department is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products.

The organisation in question has been allocated funding of &euro;70,066 in 2020, towards the cost of one manager and two FTEs. My Department has also put in place a CSP Support Fund which provided additional funding to many of the CSP supported organisations including the organisation in question which was successful in receiving additional funding of &euro;1,038 through the Support Fund.<\/p>  <p>In addition the Community and Voluntary Sector Covid-19 Stability Fund provided up to &euro;35 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund to organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector and Social Enterprises. The Fund was intended to provide a targeted, once-off, cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. To date, three tranches of successful applications have been announced, allocating funding of over &euro;25m to 489 organisations. This funding is now supporting the delivery of many critical front line services in every part of the country. <\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, some organisations were unsuccessful in securing funding for a number of reasons. I understand that some organisations may be disappointed with the outcome, or may have additional or updated information they may wish to have reviewed. For that reason, there is a Stability Scheme Appeals Process, the details of which each unsuccessful applicant has been made aware of. I understand that the organisation in question is currently engaged with the appeals process and I expect that a final decision will be made shortly. <\/p>  <p>In addition, the 2020 Community Enhancement Programme was launched in June, with funding of &euro;2m provided towards small capital grants to community organisations.  Separately, under the July stimulus package my Department launched a &euro;5m fund for repairs or upgrades to community centres and community buildings.
