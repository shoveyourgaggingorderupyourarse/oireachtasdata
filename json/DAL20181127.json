The original national broadband plan was published in 2012.  The procurement process was approved by Cabinet in December 2015.  It is now almost December 2018.  Progress has been at a snail's pace and many people are deeply frustrated despite all of the political promises made before and after election campaigns.<\/p>  <p>  The procurement process has become mired in controversy.  We have the report from the independent auditor, Peter Smyth, which I was reading prior to Leaders' Questions.  The extraordinary level of connectivity between Granahan McCourt and the former Minister stands out.  There were 18 meetings, nine telephone calls and five dinners.  The majority, especially the 12-minute phone call, clearly related to the broadband plan.  This is a level of engagement that is without precedent in the context of ministerial involvement with a lead bidder in a tender process.  It is extraordinary by any yardstick.  One has to ask why Mr. McCourt would feel it so necessary to have such regular engagement with the lead Minister.  The auditor acknowledges that those meetings gave rise to concern.  He also indicates that he cannot state unequivocally that the broadband procurement process was not discussed during two of those dinner meetings.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to put on the record that the New York meeting dealt with the character and nature of the consortium.  The independent auditor does not deal with this but it seems to us from an objective reading that the lead bidder and the character and composition of the consortium changed.  There is a question as to whether the final bidder in the race would have passed the pre-qualification stage.  We do not know that because we do not know the criteria.  Enet was the lead bidder.  That changed with the sale of Enet and Mr. McCourt's investment fund became the lead bidder.  An investment fund with a list of subcontractors is now the final bidder in the race as opposed to a number of major telecommunications companies that were involved initially.  This raises questions about the capacity to drive this through.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the final bidder is the same as the original consortium that made a bid and passed prequalification?<\/p><p>I am told an economic evaluation is under way.  When did that start and who commissioned it?  Who is conducting this evaluation, which is being done in parallel to the tender evaluation process?

A lot of progress has been made on broadband in the past couple of years.  When the Fine Gael and Independent Alliance Government entered office, only half of premises in Ireland had access to high-speed broadband.  Today, three quarters of homes, businesses and farms in Ireland have access to high-speed broadband.  A huge amount of this has been driven by Government policy and actions.  However, it means that one quarter of homes, businesses and farms in Ireland still do not have access to high-speed broadband and approximately 500,000 will need State intervention to give them access.  We are determined to get this done.  Increasingly, public services are available online and we need people to be able to access them.  It is increasingly important when it comes to business that people have access to high-speed broadband.  We are determined to make sure every home, business and farm in Ireland has access to high-speed broadband.

Almost 4,000 children will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight.  The plight of parents and children in poverty is shockingly illustrated in the picture in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which shows young mothers and their children queuing for nappies and baby formula outside the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People in Dublin.  These are examples of how the Government is failing in its responsibility to protect some of the most vulnerable citizens in society, namely, our young people and children.<\/p><p>During Leaders' Questions last Thursday, I raised the scandalous waiting lists facing children and families who try to access the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Barnardos released its winter waiting list report, which illustrates the scale of the problem in the health service in the context of children awaiting care, this morning.  The report states that 37,000 children are waiting for health assessments, be they mental health, disability or speech and language assessments.  Some 78% of children with disabilities or suspected disabilities are overdue assessments of need to identify their health requirements.  That is scandalous.  The report also highlights an issue I raised last week, namely, the fact that thousands of children are waiting for mental health assessments to identify their needs.  Many of them have been waiting over a year to be assessed.  That is another unbelievable figure.  However, this is not about numbers but about young lives, real people, families who are at their wits' end and children who are being put at risk.  The reason for this, as the Minister for Justice and Equality accepted last week in the context of CAMHS, is that there is chronic understaffing within the system.  Approximately half of the positions in CAMHS teams have been vacant for some time, yet when we raise the crisis regarding recruitment and retention that is in full swing - including the issue raised last Wednesday in respect of psychiatric nurses - the Taoiseach dismisses our concerns.  What is needed is an immediate response, particularly in areas where the problems are worst.  By filling the vacancies and improving the conditions, we can begin to improve services and attract the staff required to ensure that there are proper services.  We cannot allow a situation to persist whereby a child or young person who needs care must face an extended waiting period before obtaining access to the healthcare he or she needs.<\/p><p>During that time their healthcare and, in some cases, their lives are at risk.  We need to see dedicated action to attract new staff, to keep the excellent staff we have within our system and to reduce waiting times.  Promises were made last year that the staffing gaps in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, would be addressed.  Those promises have come and gone.  I ask the Taoiseach to recommit to ensuring that it happens this time.

It rose dramatically during the recession but has been falling for several years.  This is because of increased employment, and 97% of people in employment and their families avoid poverty.

In the past six years 2,000 posts have been approved, of which 1,500 have now been filled.  The budget next year for mental health will be &euro;1 billion, which is the biggest budget for mental health in the history of the State.  We have difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff.  All countries in the world have difficulties recruiting and retaining staff currently because there is a shortage of these people.  It is not the case that there are huge numbers of unemployed qualified staff looking for jobs here or in any country.  There is a huge shortage of people with these skills and it is a problem for our next door neighbour, for almost every country in Europe and for every western country.  We are managing to add to the staff, with 1,500 extra staff in six years, as I said, and with 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists being hired recently.  This will help us to focus on especially complex cases.  The Deputy will also be aware of the expansion of the Jigsaw services.<\/p><p>It is noteworthy from the Barnardos report, which is worth studying, that currently there are 2,621 children on the waiting list for CAMHS, waiting to see a mental health professional.  For speech and language services, over half of the children are waiting fewer than 16 weeks.  I do not know the figures for mental health but it is quite possible that more than half could be waiting fewer than 16 weeks, but it would still leave more than 1,000 who are waiting more than 16 weeks, which is not acceptable.  The Barnardos report also shows that the figure for those who are waiting a very long time, for more than one year, has actually fallen by 15% in the last year, out of 327.  The report also shows huge regional variation, which concerns me.

One parent said their seven year old son has no coping skills and is crying out with sensory issues but here they are again on a waiting list.  The child began his journey on a waiting list in 2015 and is still waiting for services he should have received years ago.  That is the reality.  When we deal with CAMHS it is not just in terms of sensory issues, it is in terms of mental health.  The system is broken.  The promises that were made in terms of resourcing the system have not been fulfilled.  In community healthcare organisation area, CHO 4, the T&aacute;naiste's constituency, there are over 700 children waiting for an initial assessment for mental health services, a third of whom have been waiting over a year.  The Taoiseach says he does not have the figures on speech and language but I can tell him what the report outlines in that regard.  Between March and August of this year there was an increase of 50% in those waiting over a year for initial assessment or to receive therapy.  By any stretch of the imagination the Government is failing these children.  On behalf of all those children and their parents, I ask the Taoiseach when he will step up to the mark and make sure there is a service fit for purpose after eight years of Fine Gael in government, such that we do not have children waiting month on month and year on year for basic services to help them reach the potential they should all have a chance to reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700006#D00900","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543329300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>On speech and language, I do have the figures.

The drug has been shown to have a significant impact on tumours in some cases.  The Government owes a duty of care to those women who have been failed by our health services, but this decision risks setting a dangerous precedent if the Government does not make the same drug available to all cervical cancer patients.<\/p> <p> Article 40 of the Constitution holds that all citizens shall be held equal before the law.  The State cannot unjustifiably or arbitrarily discriminate between citizens.  However, that is what is happening in this instance because the Government has decided to provide a treatment to some patients but not to others on the basis of dubious legal grounds.  It is not for the Government to determine who does and does not deserve the hope of a longer life and a better quality of life than others who are suffering from same fatal illness.  How can the Government decide that Vicky Phelan from Limerick should have a chance to prolong her life, but not &Aacute;ine Morgan from Galway as we saw on last night's \"Claire Byrne Live\"?  Either a treatment is so prohibitively expensive that it cannot be provided or else it must be made available to all; there is no middle ground.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Kelly, has raised this issue repeatedly.  Many patients and their family members have contacted us.  Some of them are paying privately to access pembrolizumab.  It is unsustainable for them to continue to pay privately.  In some cases, the drug may be all that is keeping people alive.  Leading oncologists, Dr. Fennelly and Professor Crown, have contacted the Minister for Health with a proposal that pembrolizumab be made available on a trial basis.  Surely the Government can come up with some arrangement with the Irish-based drug company that is making this drug in Carlow to provide it to those who could materially benefit from it now.  We need to have a plan in place to ensure equity in accessing this drug for all who need it and time is not on the side of the many people dependent on this treatment.  My question is very simple.  Will the Taoiseach, as head of the Government, provide legal clarity on the availability of pembrolizumab?  Will he give a timeline as to when the drug will be available to all cancer patients who can benefit from it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700007#E02700","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543329900,"counter":62,"content":"<p>We all appreciate the reasons the Government took exceptional actions and put in place exceptional measures for the 221 women and their families who were affected by the CervicalCheck audit scandal.  Those measures included, for example, the provision of medical cards regardless of income, counselling and a refund of out-of-pocket medical expenses.  While pembrolizumab is not specifically referenced in that package, it is counted as an out-of-pocket medical expense if a consultant prescribes it for a woman who is affected.  While this medicine is licensed for some conditions in the European Union, it is not licensed for the treatment of cervical cancer and that creates a difficulty for us.  It is licensed for other cancers, but not for cancer of the cervix.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that this has created an anomaly - an inequity - in that women who are part of the group of 221 can have that particular medicine refunded through the out-of-pocket expenses system, whereas others whose doctors may wish to recommend it for them and prescribe it for them cannot.  I accept that we need to try to resolve that anomaly.  The Deputy's suggestions are helpful.  This could be done by means of a trial or perhaps as is done in other countries but is often resisted by pharmaceutical companies here, namely, by means of a payment-by-result system whereby the reimbursement happens if the medicine actually works.  This does not happen much in Ireland but it has been done in other countries through a risk-sharing system.  We have made contact with Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme about this in the past.  We will renew our contacts in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In resolving one anomaly or inequity, we need to be careful not to create another.  Often we do these things with the best intentions of resolving one issue but, as a result, create a new inequity.<\/p><p>If it is the case that we will reimburse the cost of medicine that is not licensed for the treatment of one cancer, will the same issue then not arise for other cancers?  There are many cancers other than cervical cancer and there are many unlicensed medicines that we do not reimburse.  In resolving this inequity, as the Deputy describes it, we have to be careful that we do not create a new one.  That is part of the dilemma.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700008#F00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543330200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's response and I thank him for it but he and I both know that the current position where women suffering from the same form of cervical cancer are treated differently is not sustainable.  It is only a matter of time before they or their legal representatives will go into the court to demand that the constitutional requirement for equal treatment be vindicated.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House today that he will sit down with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to instruct the HSE to begin to negotiate with the drug company mentioned to ensure that all women who suffer from cervical cancer and whose clinicians determine that Pembrolizumab would be of benefit to them will have that drug made available to them?  If there is a knock-on from that in respect of other cancers, that is something we can deal with.  However, this is a form of cancer and the Taoiseach cannot look two women suffering from the same disease in the eye and say that the State will provide potentially life-saving treatment for one of them and not the other.

We know how sensitive we are when somebody suggests that we are a tax haven.  However, there are examples of each positive step that we have taken being accompanied by a negative one.  For example, it is positive that there was an independent review of Ireland's corporate code, a public consultation, engagement, recommendations and further consultation.  That was all part of the bigger picture relating to the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive and the new controlled foreign companies, CFC, rules but, on the other side, there were two options for Ireland to take in implementing the CFC rules.  There was model A, which most European countries chose, as it would ensure optimum effectiveness, or model B, which Ireland chose and was one of the few European countries to do so.  However, model B is reckoned to do little, if anything, to address corporate tax avoidance.  It simply applies guidelines which we are supposed to do anyway under current legislation on transfer pricing.<\/p>  <p>  There is another positive regarding corporate tax residence rules, which is the shutting down of what was known as the double Irish.  Why was that not done straightaway?  Why are we waiting until 2021?  Why was there a lead-in of ten weeks, which allows multinationals to set up a double Irish structure to use until 2021?<\/p>  <p>  It is also positive that we were one of 24 jurisdictions to have been fully compliant on tax transparency and exchange of information by the global tax forum but, while Ireland requires countries to report tax information on a country-by-country basis, the information remains confidential.  If it were public where countries are making profits and paying their tax, that data would show where tax reform is needed to ensure fairness.<\/p>  <p>  Another positive is that we undertook the spillover analysis but it only examined 6% of transfers so the analysis was not comprehensive.  Will a second more comprehensive analysis be undertaken on such corporate tax avoidance?  If we do not, it will have effects on developing countries, some of which are our partners.  We also give aid to some of them.<\/p>  <p>  A further positive is that we agreed to the EU directive for a common mandatory reporting regime for certain tax advisers and companies.  We were one of only three EU member states to have a mandatory disclosure regime in place prior to agreement on the directive, but there are questions about its effectiveness because there are so many exemptions to it.<\/p><p>Base erosion and profit shifting was a good first step.  We were in a group which signed that multinational instrument at the first opportunity, but we chose not to sign article 12, which is key to ensuring no tax avoidance by multinational companies.<br\/><br\/>Small steps are being taken, but why are we not taking the big steps that will make a real difference to tax avoidance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700009#G00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543330800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for a comprehensive and detailed question.  I have read up on these areas but I am no expert.  I remember reading in detail about why we opted for model A rather than model B, but it might be best to ask the Minister for Finance to explain that or to give a more detailed answer because I do not remember the exact reasons, although it made sense when I read the memo at the time.<\/p>  <p>  On a more general point, Ireland is a pro-business, pro-trade and pro-enterprise country.  It has worked for Ireland and it is one of the reasons we are approaching full employment, incomes are at a record high and we are a relatively prosperous country.  Part of our economic and industrial policy is having low corporation profit tax.  It is one of the reasons so many multinationals base operations in Ireland, although it is not the only reason.  It is also one of the reasons our companies are so successful and are able to grow and expand.<\/p>  <p>  It is very much my firm view that large and small profitable companies should pay their fair share of tax in full, where and when it is owed.  Ireland is not a tax haven and nor do we wish to be perceived as one.  We have done much work to correct that perception if it has existed in the past couple of years.  This has involved phasing out the double Irish, to which the Deputy referred, and getting rid of the whole concept of stateless corporations, which is no longer permitted or at least not in our jurisdiction.  It has also involved information exchange, and we were one of the first countries to sign up to that.  Our Revenue Commissioners will tell their counterparts in other countries how much tax was paid here in order that we can see whether companies are paying tax in other countries.  On the night of the budget, we introduced the exit tax, and in the next couple of weeks we should have a solution to the issue of the single malt.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware we collected all the moneys the European Commission says are owed by Apple.

While there is no problem with being pro-business and pro-trade, there must be fairness.  I sometimes wonder how much weight is given to the submissions and recommendations from non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as Oxfam Ireland and Christian Aid, because it is obvious that other organisations carry much greater weight.  It is damaging our reputation, and we have a strong reputation in humanitarian work and human rights.

Recent data from the Central Statistics Office suggest there is a noticeable slowdown in the Border region and that the devaluation of sterling has had a significant impact on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, there.  There are many Brexit schemes but the combined take-up of these to date has been minuscule.  Is the Taoiseach willing to set a specific target for the number of businesses receiving support in order that they might cope with the impact of Brexit?  To date, all there has been is the announcement of amounts of money to be spent at some point in the future.  Until we see specific targets for businesses directly helped, the delivery deficit is likely to be continually hidden behind the advertising campaigns which promise a lot but deliver little.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Taoiseach became very defensive when I raised the Government's love of referring to things as \"action plans\".  He even claimed the Government had delivered 200,000 jobs through the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, reviewed the action plan and said it is not possible to isolate any specific figure of job creation under the plan.  We do not need action plan for Brexit designed to help the Government claim credit for other people's work.  We need hard targets for businesses directly helped through the schemes launched with such fanfare by the Minister.  There needs to be a stronger correlation between the announcement and what is actually done.  The vote is taking place in the House of Commons on 11 December and the draft withdrawal treaty is coming into far more focus.  Most business and farming people on both sides of the Border support the withdrawal treaty.  It is disappointing, therefore, that the DUP seems to be hardening its original stance on the draft withdrawal treaty following its conference at the weekend.  Will the Taoiseach provide an update on the preparation of east-west arrangements for Dublin Airport following Brexit?  Given that most goods entering the North come via Dublin Port, is there any further update on scoping and expansion to facilitate further checks if needed?  Is the Government scoping the use of Rosslare Europort in order to ease any possible congestion and ensure the smooth transport of goods via truck, etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700017#P01000","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1543334700,"counter":191,"content":"<p>It would be surprising if, when visiting the Border, any politician did not involve himself or herself in dialogues on Brexit.

Did the Taoiseach discuss the implications of a hard Brexit, which is now a very real prospect?  Will he share his view on preparations for such an eventuality?

It is good on occasion to have days where we focus just on education, childcare, disability, health or housing.  The particular focus of this visit was education, disability and childcare.<\/p>  <p>  We have not set particular targets for businesses accessing credit under the various Brexit loan schemes.  We have decided not to do this for good reasons.  There are a lot of businesses that do not want to borrow or increase their debt and this is a decision they are entitled to make.  Many of them have paid off debts they built up over the recession period and they do not want to take on new debt.  Some have their own reserves and they will use them rather than take on more debt.  We want to make sure these low-cost loans are available to business but that is quite different from encouraging businesses to take on additional debt if they do not want to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I meet businesses all the time that tell me they feel they are being unfairly criticised when we say they have not taken up offers of vouchers, Brexit assessments or loans because they have made an assessment themselves that Brexit will not affect them dramatically because they do not trade much or they only trade with particular countries.  Sometimes they state they have made a decision to wait and see.  They want to see how things will pan out over the coming weeks or months before taking action.  We need to make sure the loan supports and information vouchers are available to business but we need to respect the fact that many businesses will decide they do not want to take up these supports because they do not trade with the UK, because they feel they have adequate reserves and finance or because they are already adequately prepared.  We have to respect their autonomy and their right to make their own decisions about their own businesses in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  We approved another memo at Cabinet today on contingency planning.  We have planned for two things.  These are the central case scenario, which is pretty much the deal that has now been made and the deal we hoped would be made, with a transition period, a single customs territory and backstop.  We have also planned for a no deal hard Brexit scenario, which we do not think is likely but we must prepare for nonetheless.  In many ways they are a graduation of the same contingency plan because the central case scenario requires one amount and the no deal scenario requires another amount of activity.  This involved an update on recruitment and we are confident.  We have an assurance from Revenue and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that the necessary recruitment is under way.  I cannot remember the exact figure with regard to Customs and Excise officials, but several hundred will be in place in March and the rest will be in place after that.  We also examined what would be required in terms of physical infrastructure at Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort and how it can be provided.  In Dublin Airport it would involve an upgrade to the customs and border services and at Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port it would involve physical infrastructure, such as parking areas for HGVs and examination stations.  These preparations are very much under way.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt we can be totally prepared for a Brexit with a deal because we have the transition period and we know what will happen if there is no deal.  We will have a backstop.  It will be impossible for any country to be fully prepared for a no deal cliff edge hard Brexit but we will be as prepared as we possibly can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700018#Q00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Digital Strategy","time":1543335300,"counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700018#Q00250"},{"type":"question","time":1543335300,"counter":195,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[45623\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700018#Q00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the consultation process on the digital strategy recently announced by his Department.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1543335300,"counter":196,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[45639\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700018#Q00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his Department's digital strategy.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1543335300,"counter":197,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[46990\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700018#Q00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the digital strategy of his Department.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1543335300,"counter":198,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[49144\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700018#Q00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the recently announced consultation process in respect of the national digital strategy.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543335300,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is developing a new national digital strategy to help Ireland maximise the economic and societal benefits from digitalisation.

The strategy is being led as a shared effort by the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the office of the chief information officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  An interdepartmental group, which includes representatives from all Departments, is also assisting the development of the strategy.  This approach reflects the broad spread of policy areas impacted by digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  In July, the Government agreed a framework for the national digital strategy, which reflected preliminary consultations with civic society, business representatives, education providers and academics.  A wider public consultation exercise to allow citizens to influence the development of the strategy started on Monday, 22 October, and closed last Friday, 23 November.  This allowed people to submit their views online, by email or by post.  More than 300 responses were received and the submissions are now being analysed.  In parallel, there is ongoing consultation with stakeholders and experts to inform development of the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the new national digital strategy will set out Ireland's vision and ambition in the fast-changing digital world as well as specific initiatives in areas such as eGovernment, enterprise policy, digital inclusion, access and regulation.

Given recent reports, the strategy cannot be done quickly enough.  It seems it has infiltrated all of our lives far quicker and deeper than anyone could have anticipated.

Young people are accessing them not just in greater numbers but also at a younger age.  The Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently discussed the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill, which was brought forward by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The Bill is supported by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, CyberSafeIreland and the Ombudsman for Children's office.  Industry bodies have also stated that they are open to the concept.  The Bill complements many of the objectives in the Minister for Justice and Equality's action plan for online safety.

Obviously there is upskilling of people already in the workplace.  That is important to ensure they can continue to have jobs into the future and that companies embrace the digital economy.  That is done through a number of existing mechanisms.  Sometimes it is fully funded by the Government and sometimes businesses have to make a contribution.  A great deal of learning is happening in schools.  Children in primary and secondary schools are getting a good digital education and I am impressed when I visit schools around the country to see the extent to which technology is being integrated into schools, particularly primary schools.  Deputies will be aware that computer science is now an examination subject in the leaving certificate examination for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the future jobs programme.  Last week, we took the first steps in developing that programme, which anticipates the reality that the world of work will look very different in the next couple of decades.  People will not have a job for life, and most people will have two or three different careers in the course of their lives.  Many jobs that currently exist will not exist in the future and many jobs that we have not even imagined will exist.  Changes such as automation, augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics and so forth will fundamentally change the world of work.  Autonomous driving is one example.  Between 10% and 16% of men in this country drive for a living in some way or other.  If we replace buses, trains, taxis and trucks with autonomous vehicles we will have to find new jobs for the people who currently drive those vehicles.  The future jobs programme is all about that.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of encouraging greater use of online Government services, a healthy digital Government is fundamentally connected with the wider digital health of a country.  We have made substantial progress in increased delivery of high quality online public services.  For example, we have centralised portals for communications and services, gov.ie and MyGovId.ie.  We also continue to work on improving the citizen experience and promoting the uptake of online activities.  The national digital strategy will help to raise awareness and highlight the benefits of engaging with online Government services.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the digital divide and digital engagement, increased digitalisation is going to change Ireland and the world with or without policy action.  We cannot stem the tide but we can determine how to embrace digitalisation positively for the benefit of every citizen, business and community in Ireland.  To this end we are working to develop a strategy that is collaborative and is developed in partnership with citizens and stakeholders.  The public consultation is very important and that is why continuing engagement with stakeholders in all sectors of society will be a hallmark of the strategy's development.  There will be a focus in the strategy on trust, society and inclusion.  We are putting the well-being of citizens at the heart of the strategy.  Digitalisation presents us not only with challenges but also profound opportunities.  Digital Government services, for example, offer the chance of more equality and efficiency in how our public services are administered.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding digital protection and digital safety, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, came into effect on 25 May last.  We enacted the Data Protection Act 2018 which gives effect to limited areas of flexibility under GDPR before this date.  Ireland is among a small group of member states to meet the deadline.  Since GDPR came into effect the Data Protection Commissioner has seen a rise in data breach notifications, which are now obligatory.  In addition, the Date Protection Commission is already seeing numerous major difficult cross-border complaints being transferred to it under the EU one-stop-shop model.  There are several significant data protection cases before the Irish and European courts, as well as other cases that might end up before the courts.  Whatever the outcome, the Government will continue to comply with GDPR as it evolves.  Funding for the Data Protection Commission is &euro;15.2 million for next year, which represents a 30% increase on the 2018 allocation and an eight-fold increase since 2014.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of a digital safety commissioner, many stakeholders have called for the establishment of such a commissioner.  Last February the Government did not oppose the passing on Second Stage of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Private Members' Bill which seeks to establish the office of a digital safety commissioner.  The Bill has been referred to the joint committee by the Oireachtas.  The action plan for online safety covers a range of activities relevant to the proposed office of the digital safety commissioner, including education, awareness raising, communicating with the public, oversight and consultative structures.

Save the Children estimate that 50,000 children died in 2017 as an indirect consequence of the blockade.<\/p>  <p>  We must also consider what is happening in Saudi Arabia itself.

Amnesty International recently produced a report on the routine sexual harassment, torture and degradation of civil rights activists, including hanging prisoners from the ceiling and sexual tormenting of women prisoners by people wearing face masks.  Three activists who had just received the alternative Nobel prize in Stockholm have been imprisoned for between ten and 15 years for crimes such as \"disobeying the ruler\" and \"harming the reputation of the State\", \"engaged in peaceful protests where they criticised the Government\".

What are we doing about all this?  What are we doing to assist the humanitarian response to the crisis?  Aid organisations cite the blockade over the past three years by the Saudi-led coalition at the city port of Hodeidah, which handles 90% of Yemen's imports, as the reason for the food shortages.

Since 2015, we have provided almost &euro;16.5 million in humanitarian assistance directly to Yemen and we are also providing additional humanitarian aid through our contributions to the EU.  Ireland has consistently and strongly communicated its concerns, especially regarding the safety of civilians and the need for safe access for humanitarian assistance.  We have conveyed this to all parties to the conflict - to Saudi Arabia but also the United Arab Emirates and Iran, which are involved as well.  In October, the T&aacute;naiste relayed Ireland's strong views directly to the Saudi ambassador and will continue to make our views known both bilaterally and at the UN and EU.  At present, there is no consensus at EU level for an arms embargo on Saudi.  Ireland does not have an arms industry and, therefore, unilateral action would not have any effect.  However, all exports from Ireland of military and dual use goods are subject to a strict assessment on a case-by-case basis against eight criteria contained in the EU code of conduct on arms exports.  <\/p> <p> The agenda for ASEM was focused primarily on regional geopolitical issues affecting the European and Asia-Pacific regions.  It is important to understand that ASEM covers Europe and east Asia but does not cover the Middle East or the Arab world.  Yemen, Iran and Saudi Arabia were not present and are not members of ASEM.  However, I anticipate that the conflict in Yemen will feature in discussions at the EU-Arab League meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Egypt next February.  Ireland continues to work at EU and UN level to seek a resolution to the crisis in Yemen.  The issue was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 November, at which EU foreign Ministers reconfirmed our backing for the efforts of the UN special envoy, Martin Griffiths, to bring all parties to the negotiating table.  I was not present at the EU-Korea meeting, as that was handled at Commission President and Council President level.  I did not have a formal bilateral with Prime Minister Medvedev but we were at the same table for one of the meals and I did raise the issue of election disruption with him.<\/p> <p> Regarding Saudi Arabia, the Government fully supports calls for an independent and impartial investigation into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  There has been some progress in identifying the perpetrators but we are still awaiting clarification of what transpired.  The ongoing investigations must be transparent and credible, get to the facts of the case and ensure that all those responsible for the killings are held accountable.  Ireland and the EU are closely monitoring investigations as they proceed and we will consider what further steps to take in due course in close consultation with our EU partners.  Ireland raised its concerns about the killing at the UN Human Rights Council on 5 November during Saudi Arabia's universal periodic review and we will continue to raise our concerns about this case, in particular, and human rights issues in general both directly with the Saudi authorities and at EU and international level whenever appropriate opportunities arise.  As I mentioned earlier, the T&aacute;naiste met the Saudi ambassador in Dublin last month and stressed the need for a credible and open investigation leading to accountability for all of those involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700020#S00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1543337100,"counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700021#T00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Funding","time":1543337100,"counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700021#T00300"},{"type":"question","time":1543337100,"counter":218,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[49186\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700021#T00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his Department has undertaken a value for money review of the cost of the national broadband plan; the impact it will have on the on the wider national development plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1543337100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Cowen ready for action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700021#T00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543337100,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I will let the Minister answer first and will add up my time after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700021#T00600","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1543337100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Under the public spending code, value for money reviews are conducted on existing programmes of expenditure and are targeted at areas of significant expenditure where there is the greatest potential for them to add value and influence policy developments.

As is widely acknowledged, there is currently an international shortage of consultants, especially for CAMHS.  The Cork-Kerry CHO has established a CAMHS medical recruitment task force to review efforts to recruit and retain medical staff, led by the head of service for human resources.  Every possible option is pursued in order to recruit consultant psychiatrists.  That is accepted.  Acknowledging the critical impact medical vacancies have on service provision, a dedicated medical manpower office has been appointed.  Local management is working with 11 national and international agencies to source suitably qualified candidates.  All options are being explored, including the provision of out of hours or weekend clinics by a consultant working elsewhere, along with the potential use of telemedicine solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Some 2,453 children were on CAMHS waiting lists nationally at the end of September.  Some 656 of these were in CHO 4.  There has been a decrease nationally in children on the waiting list for longer than 12 months from 317 in August 2018 to 313 in September 2018.  This decrease is reflected in CHO 4 with 174 children waiting in excess of 12 months in September, down from 183 in August.  The recent budget saw the mental health allocation increase to nearly &euro;1 billion, a clear indication of the importance placed by the Government on the mental health of the nation.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;245 million in the HSE's mental health budget since 2012.  This has helped to fund a number of initiatives aimed at reducing demand on mental health services.  It has also provided an extra 130 psychiatric nurse undergraduate places each year to come on-stream in 2020 and 2021.  Some 40 postgraduate posts have been funded.  Together with the recent appointment by the HSE of approximately 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists into primary care, and ten advanced nurse practitioners directly into CAMHS, it is anticipated that these posts will help to reduce demand on CAMHS.

On 1 October, I asked the Minister for Health the status of the provision of new contracts to HSE home help staff, the timeline for completion and whether he is satisfied with the progress on it.  I received a very comprehensive reply.  I was told the contracts for home help staff are being rolled out, rostering arrangements will be put in place and the work will be completed by March 2019.  I remind the Minister of State the agreement was put in place under the auspices of the WRC through engagement between SIPTU and the HSE.  The key provisions of the arrangements are that there will be an increase in contracted hours for more than 90% of the home support staff if they choose to accept the HSE's offer, there will be a change in title from home help worker to healthcare support assistants to better reflect the nature of the service being provided, rostered arrangements will be introduced to give staff greater certainty regarding their hours of attendance, with travel time factored into these arrangements, and there will be an assignment of work bases.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, as of last week, little or no progress had been made, which forced the union to ballot staff members on strike action and an overwhelming majority of members voted in favour.

By way of background, in April 2014, following a Labour Court recommendation, the HSE implemented new contracts for its directly employed home help staff.  These contracts provided each home help with a guaranteed minimum number of hours per week and a guaranteed income each week with work assignments managed in a reasonable way to meet the needs of clients over the course of 12 months.  This new contract was regarded by staff unions and management as a positive development for HSE employed home helps.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, in 2017, the HSE engaged with SIPTU under a WRC conciliation to review current home help staff contracts.  This review was provided for in the 2014 home help agreement.  The aim was to ensure that contracted arrangements reflect the needs of the service, to maximise contracted hours for HSE directly employed staff and to take further steps towards professionalising the home support service.  The agreement, under the auspices of the WRC will provide for an increase in contracted hours for more than 90% of home support staff if they choose to accept the HSE offers; a change of title from home help worker to healthcare support assistant to better reflect the nature of the services being provided; the introduction of rostered arrangements to give staff greater certainty regarding their hours of attendance, with travel time factored into these arrangements; the assignment of work bases; and a requirement that all new home help staff should possess, on recruitment, the minimum qualification equivalent to a relevant QQI approved major award at level 5 or higher.<\/p>  <p>  While this agreement involves home help staff who are represented by SIPTU, the agreement will also have implications for the direct line managers of home help staff, the home help co-ordinators.  These co-ordinators are represented by F&oacute;rsa.  In particular, I understand the co-ordinators are concerned about the impact of this new contract on their role and responsibilities.  I understand the HSE has met F&oacute;rsa at national level regarding the co-ordinators' concerns about the impact of the home help contract review and the HSE has made a number of proposals to address their concerns.  These include the introduction of an IT system to assist in the production of rosters and an examination of the role and function of the home help co-ordinators under the clerical and administration job evaluation scheme.  A review of the structure and supports of the role was also proposed.  I understand that F&oacute;rsa has agreed to these proposals.

The report in June 2017 refers to the local authorities being significantly under-resourced and resources being significantly reduced by between 20% and 35% from 2008 levels.  The April 2018 interim report of the expert advisory group has only nine pages but attention is repeatedly called to the underfunding.  It states: \"We believe it is now all the more urgent...\" and refers to underfunding of Galway local authorities in comparison with other local authorities.  It recommends. \"that the existing deficiencies in respect of both the human and financial resources be expeditiously resolved as an essential prerequisite to the amalgamation process\", on page 3.

Deputy Connolly was probably attending the Committee of Public Accounts meeting last week when the Galway Deputies, and some strays from Roscommon, attended a meeting about the Local Government Bill 2018.  It particularly focused on funding but also dealt with other issues.  I have held this office for a little more than a year and the funding measures relating to the Galway County Council have been raised on many occasions by Members of both Houses.<\/p>  <p>  The funding system that applies to local authorities is complex, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources, including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from the Government.  Local authorities vary significantly in size, population, public service demands and infrastructure.  It is not possible to compare absolute levels of funding received in local authority areas as to do so would not take account of the significant differences between them.  Government funding of local authorities similarly presents a complex picture, with transfers coming from a wide range of Departments and offices and not solely from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Most of the funding sourced from the Government and provided to local authorities must be used for specified purposes and services.  In 2017, funding from Government sources to local authorities totalled more than &euro;2.66 billion.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a wide agenda, including the targeted provision of a range of necessary housing supports.  To deliver on this agenda, the Department allocates significant resources to local authorities and channels local property tax receipts to those authorities, the use of which is largely at the discretion of individual authorities.  Funding from the Department to Galway City Council totalled &euro;18.6 million in 2016, &euro;25.7 million in 2017 and &euro;22.3 million to date in 2018.  In the case of Galway County Council, a total of &euro;71.8 million was provided in 2016, &euro;86.2 million was provided in 2017 and &euro;87.8 million has been provided to date in 2018.  This must be recognised as significant funding.  I work closely with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector generally, and local authorities individually, have the financial wherewithal to meet existing and emerging challenges.  In doing so, I must operate within the parameters of the national fiscal and budgetary situation and competing priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Local property tax, LPT, payments replaced general purpose grants in 2015.  The role of local authorities in deciding the local adjustment factor for LPT, up to 15% annually, is vital.  The decision provides an important connection between local revenue raising and local expenditure.  While Galway County Council increased the LPT by 10% for 2018, by not doing so for 2019 the council has forgone &euro;2 million of additional revenue for 2019.  The adoption of a balanced budget is probably the single most important duty that the elected members are called upon to carry out each year.  To achieve that balance, the members must make informed and necessary choices to balance the level of service provision with the available income, prioritising as necessary.  Galway City Council adopted its budget for 2019 last week and the county council is scheduled to hold its budget meeting next Friday.<\/p>  <p>  A review was established to examine local authority baseline funding more generally and to develop a methodology for distributing any available additional funding to achieve a greater balance and equity of funding outcomes.  This work is almost complete and I will provide further information in due course.  Separately, the expert advisory group on local government arrangements in Galway, in its report in April this year, recommended that ahead of the amalgamation of Galway city and county councils existing deficiencies in respect of both human and financial resources be expeditiously resolved as an essential prerequisite to the amalgamation process.  Both the city and county chief executives participated in the group and endorsed its recommendations.  My Department is currently engaged with Galway County Council with regard to additional funding, which was discussed at the meeting last week, and will continue to engage constructively in that process over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700033#FF00600","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1543344900,"counter":368,"content":"<p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I welcome constructive engagement at any level but at this stage we need action.

We have to make sure that we do this right.  Galway deserves to be treated well.  There are three counties on the bottom of the scale and Galway is one of them.  With regard to the Bill, and for the benefit of trying to get agreement with everyone, the funding is the first issue that must be addressed.  We need to get this sorted.

I believe the Deputy quoted a reduction of between 20% and 30% in staff numbers in the Galway councils since 2008.  There is not a local authority in the State that has not had a 20% reduction in staff members since 2008.  There might be an issue in Galway about the increase in numbers since, such as in the last year or two.  I do not have those figures on projected increases in staff numbers but I will try to ascertain them.  The local authority sector was decimated by the downturn as funding was decreased.  The recruitment embargo in the public sector also had a huge effect on local authorities across the State, not least in Galway.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal to have a joint chief executive stems completely from what happened in similar merges in Tipperary, Limerick and Waterford.  The first step in the process, before the merger had even begun, was to appoint a joint chief executive.  We will endeavour, with the Oireachtas Members who represent Galway and with the Galway councils' management, to ensure there is a cash injection for Galway on the basis of reform.  The discretionary fund that is available to anyone in my position is tiny.  Despite the fact local government annual budgets amount to anywhere in the region of &euro;4 billion, discretionary funds for the Ministers are very small and are ring-fenced for advancing reform in the local government sector.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that Galway's municipal district structure is weaker because the funding issue has been an overhang for years.  I put it to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that it was an overhang when he was in government also, and it was not resolved.  It did not just appear in recent years.  It has been exacerbated by the downturn, which exacerbated everything with regard to funding.  I acknowledge and accept that in order for a merger to happen the funding issue has to be addressed.  We will address it by short-term funding in Galway and by the adjustments to the baseline.  The fundamental problem in Galway is the baseline figure.  The model that is used currently has 100 individual variables.  Shortly we will propose a much more streamlined baseline calculation mechanism for local government funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700034#GG00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","time":1543344900,"counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700034#GG00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1543344900,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for coming to the Chamber this evening to deal with this Topical Issue matter.  We might have a difference of opinion at times but the Minister of State engages quite a lot.  We also had a scenario with the centre in Ballaghadereen some time back.<\/p>  <p>  This Topical Issue matter concerns a centre, which I accept is a direct provision centre, on the Leitrim side.  It is not in the Roscommon-Galway constituency.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and I represent the Roosky area and much of the village is in County Roscommon.  I am not here with any flowery presentation for the Minister of State nor to make a glossy speech.  I am here to talk facts.  I acknowledge we need to accept the agreements Ireland into which has entered to take in asylum seekers and to make their lives an bit better,  and I fully pledge my support in that regard.  However, the method by which it is being done in many parts of the State is causing grave concern.  People should not be locked away in direct provision centres for seven, eight or ten years as I heard one lady say last night on the television.<\/p>  <p>  Whether one is on the Leitrim or Roscommon side of Roosky, and Deputy Fitzmaurice will be aware of this, it is the veil of secrecy that surrounded this news that is really annoying the local community.  This community is rebuilding its village.  This community has many foreign nationals living in it who are treated like everyone else in the village.  It is unacceptable to me and the other public representatives in the area to suggest bringing in 80 plus people to live in a hotel there, increasing the population by at least 15% where there is not the proper infrastructure, where there are not the jobs and where there is not the public transport.<\/p>  <p>  We have to change the way we deal with direct provision.  The way it is being dealt with is not good enough.  I am sure the Government also recognises that there will have to be improvements in the way the matter is dealt with.  We need to have more consultation with local people.  It is really annoying to think that there was such a lack of consultation with the local community in this case.  Were the teachers in the school spoken to?  Were the local doctors spoken to?  Was there any talk about reopening the health centre that was closed in the last 12 or 18 months?  No, there was not.  That is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  I consider the communities I represent in Roosky and other places in the Roscommon-Galway constituency as mature communities and I am sure the representatives on the Sligo-Leitrim side also feel the same.  These people would like to be told what might be happening in their community.  I consider them to be intelligent people who certainly would not turn a blind eye to people in need.  The manner in which Government is dealing with this is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is a decent individual who always picks up the phone to people when they make representations on issues.  Why were the people of Roosky not informed of this?  Why was there no consultation? Why was there no engagement with the schools or the doctors?  I asked for a meeting last week for the public representatives from Roscommon-Galway and Sligo-Leitrim, which was granted, but it now seems to have gone off the agenda.  Why were the people in the community not met, as they requested?  I will give the Minister of State an opportunity to answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700034#GG00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1543344900,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Eugene Murphy for raising this important topic.  I also acknowledge his interest and support in Ballaghadereen previously and his sincerity in this regard.  It is important to set out for the record and for public awareness the chain of events that led to this development.  In January and again in September of this year, the Reception and Integration Agency of my Department published a call in the national press for expressions of interest for premises to meet the increasing demand for accommodation for persons in the protection process, known as asylum seekers.  This call sought expressions of interest from parties who may be interested in providing accommodation and related services on an urgent and emergency basis.  This was issued in response to the urgent and unforeseen demand for accommodation and related services from those persons arriving in the State seeking international protection.<\/p><p>The criteria against which the Department assessed the offers of accommodation were availability, standard of property, ability to provide communal social spaces for residents, ability to cater at mealtimes and proximity to various other services.<\/p> <p> It should be noted that these premises were offered to the Department by individual contractors across the country.  The Department did not randomly choose any one location over another location.  The owners of the properties came forward and offered them.<\/p> <p> Following on-site assessments carried out by staff of the Department, the Shannon Key West Hotel in Roosky, County Leitrim, was deemed to be a suitable premises for the needs of the Department.  The premises will be available following refurbishment, is capable of providing meals to residents, has scope to provide the required communal social areas required by residents and is located close to other services.  My Department has engaged with the chief executive officer of Leitrim County Council and has provided the elected members of the council with information regarding the opening of the new accommodation centre.<\/p> <p> As with every other accommodation centre in the country, my Department works closely with the HSE, the Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection and all other relevant Departments and agencies to co-ordinate the delivery of State services to residents.<\/p> <p> The Shannon Key West Hotel will provide accommodation and ancillary services for approximately 80 asylum seekers for one year, pending compliance with all regulatory requirements.  The indicative timeline for the opening of the centre is within the next six weeks.  I understand there are other legal issues involved at the moment; that is one of the reasons our meeting did not go ahead at this time.  As I have indicated, this centre is opening on an emergency and time-limited basis.  To meet the accommodation needs in the longer term, the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services by way of the independent living model, to persons in the protection process, will be advertised.  This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and is scheduled for completion in 2020.  This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State.<\/p> <p> As soon as it was known that an agreement was possible, people were notified straightaway.  Prior to that, it could be that an agreement would not be possible.  As soon as it was known, people were notified.  I also wish to stress again that this is on an emergency and time-limited basis.  The alternative is for people to be on the streets.  We are also working hard using the McMahon report and others to improve and upgrade the standard of accommodation throughout the country; 98% of the recommendations in the McMahon report have been fulfilled.  The Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children also can visit all these centres to take complaints.  We are in the process at the moment in co-operation with the NGOs of putting together a series of standards to upgrade things even further.  As well as that, we have decreased the amount of time people are staying in these centres quite a bit.  People are offered accommodation; they are not locked away.  They can come and go as they wish.

He has spoken about communications with the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments.  My information comes from speaking to the medical and educational people.

A lot of people criticise direct provision, but we have made significant improvements in the system over the past number of years and continue to do so.  That has to be acknowledged.  We have shortened the time people live in the centres and we move them on as quickly as we can.  Either they are told their application has not succeeded and they must leave, or they are told they can stay and we try to get accommodation for them.  Some 60,000 people have benefitted from that over recent years.  People can come and go as they wish.  I have outlined the services that are available.  I have yet to see a better alternative.  If the Deputy has one, he might tell me what it is.  I would be delighted to sit down with him for as long as it takes to learn about it.<\/p>  <p>  To meet our obligations as set out in the EU directive, which lays down standards for the reception of persons seeking international protection, and which was transposed into Irish law as the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, the State must have available sufficient accommodation to meet the demands of persons in the protection process.  Due to significant demand, my Department has sought to identify additional accommodation by publishing expressions of interest in the national press, as the current accommodation portfolio will not meet the demand.  In response to that expression of interest, the premises in Roosky and elsewhere were offered to the Department by the owner.  As with all our accommodation centres, whether located in rural or urban areas, my Department will work closely with all relevant State agencies such as the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills to make sure the residents get what they need.  All contractors are obliged to meet the reasonable transport needs of residents and so on.  The contractor in each centre is also required to set up a friends of the centre group.  There are 37 such centres around the country and they are all working well.  I am sure Roosky will be no different.  The friends of the centre groups were recommended by the McMahon report to facilitate linkages between the residents and the local community and to encourage integration and inclusion.  My Department worked closely with this group to achieve these aims.  That is happening all over the country and is going very well.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the other questions the Deputy asked, there is no difficulty whatsoever meeting Oireachtas Members.  As he will be aware, there is a question mark over this centre at the moment and until that is resolved, it would be better for us to hold on and see what will happen.  As soon as that is resolved, I have no difficulty meeting the Deputy and his colleagues at any time and place to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700035#HH00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"African Development (Bank and Fund) Bill 2018: Instruction to Committee","time":1543345500,"counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700035#HH00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1543345500,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;That it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in relation to the African Development (Bank and Fund) Bill 2018, that:(a) Standing Order 154 is modified as outlined in Standing Order 200 to provide that the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the existing subject matter of the Bill, in relation to sections 1 and 2 of the International Finance Corporation Act 1958, in order to allow for proposed changes in the International Finance Corporation's Articles of Agreement to be approved by way of D&aacute;il Resolution rather than by primary legislation; and<br \/><br \/>(b) pursuant to Standing Order 154, the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill, in relation to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the confidentiality of taxpayer information, in order to allow for this information to be disclosed by the Department of Finance when authorised by the Freedom of Information Act;and that it has power to make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>The purpose of my remarks is to explain to Members the background to, and the need for, amendments to the International Finance Corporation Act 1958 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, respectively, and to explain why they are being tabled by the Minister for Finance to the African Development (Bank and Fund) Bill 2018.<\/p><p> As Members will recall during his Second Stage speech on the Bill the Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, outlined that we were considering introducing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  While these amendments do not directly relate to the original intentions behind the Bill, which as Members will be aware serves to facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the African Development Bank and African Development Fund, both amendments are of a time-sensitive nature, with the African Development (Bank and Fund) Bill considered an appropriate vehicle to address them.<\/p> <p> I will now provide further details.  Although outside the scope of the Bill as published on 25 September, the first proposed amendment relates to an issue that is relevant to Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with development banks generally, through amending the International Finance Corporation Act 1958 which provides for Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the International Finance Corporation, IFC.  The IFC is a sister organisation of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group.  Its focus is to encourage private sector development in developing countries.  Ireland has been asked to vote in respect of a proposed change to the IFC articles of agreement before the voting deadline of September 2019.  The proposed legislative amendment seeks to alleviate the legislative burden associated with Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the IFC through allowing for changes in the IFC&rsquo;s articles of agreement to be approved by way of D&aacute;il resolution rather than by primary legislation.<\/p> <p> As Members may be aware the International Finance Corporation Act provides for the approval of the IFC&rsquo;s articles of agreement and allows for the Minister to make payments related to this agreement.  This is in line with Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution which provides that the State shall not be bound by an international agreement, including any amendments, which involves a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p> The proposed amendments to the International Finance Corporation Act will enable changes in the articles of agreement to be approved by way of resolution of the D&aacute;il.  Currently, as has been advised by the Office of the Attorney General, approval of changes to the IFC articles of agreement would require primary legislation.  In the case of Ireland's membership of other international financial institutions, the Development Banks Act 2005 provides that such changes may be approved by means of a D&aacute;il resolution.  This approach has reduced the administrative and legislative burden associated with our membership of these institutions, while still allowing for full D&aacute;il oversight via a resolution.<\/p> <p> In summary the proposed legislative amendment seeks to replicate this provision in the case of the IFC legislation through amending the definitions within sections 1 and 2 of the Act.  This would bring it in line with the legislation governing Ireland&rsquo;s membership of other international financial institutions.<\/p> <p> The second amendment proposes to amend section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides the basis for confidentiality of taxpayer information.  Section 851A also provides the basis for the circumstances in which such information can be disclosed by the Revenue Commissioners, including the limited circumstances in which such information can be disclosed to the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p> The proposed amendment will address a conflict between the legislative provisions of section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act and those of the Freedom of Information Act, which currently prevents the Department of Finance from providing records to the Office of the Information Commissioner, even when it is statutorily required to do so in the context of the operation of freedom of information legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700035#HH00700","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543346100,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this instruction to committee motion.

The second seeks to resolve the conflict between the FOI rules and the tax Acts.  We will discuss the matter in more detail in committee.  I have no problem with allowing it to proceed.  It is interesting to consider the balance between taxpayer confidentiality and the right of the public to access information deemed by them to be important.  I understand this change will allow the Office of the Information Commissioner to access and assess information that is confidential under tax laws.  That is a necessary change, but it is limited to the Information Commissioner, which is worthy.<\/p>  <p>  I have had freedom of information requests refused when I sought records related to the Department of Finance, for example, in its meetings with Apple at a time when the House was discussing changing our tax code, a change which actually favoured the company and others to the tune of billions of euro.  Private meetings which result in potential changes to the country's GDP are of public interest and the influence of big businesses in a small country means that their business becomes our business.  That discussion may be appropriate for another day when the amendment is discussed in committee.  The motion should open up a wider conversation about how in very limited circumstances freedom of information and the notion of taxpayer confidentiality can coexist.<\/p>  <p>  I do not object to the first amendment the Minister of State mentioned, as it will still require D&aacute;il resolution.

This is in the context of the relationship with the International Finance Corporation which is a sister organisation of the World Bank.  I recommend the Minister of State read some of the recent statements by Dr. Kim, the president of the World Bank who comes from South Korea, in which he points to the error in the approach of organisations such as the World Bank which over many decades has just really been about big dams and other very large infrastructural projects, which in many cases did not particularly benefit local communities and may have moved them off their lands in parts of Asia and Africa.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Kim has suggested we should now have a focus on investment in people, particularly in education and in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.  Ireland's commitment to the African Development Bank is relatively modest and will take place over a lengthy period.  As a new contributor to the bank, we need to ensure that our contribution reflects this welcome change of heart on behalf of institutions such as the World Bank, which, of course, in Africa and Asia is very influential in the projects that get the international funding.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed concentration on investment in people, education and the Millennium Development Goals would mean that post Ireland joining the African Development Bank the focus would be more people centred than simply, as we have very often seen, very rich western bidders for contracts walking away with most of the money spent in Africa and local people benefiting very little.  Among these local people I include women and children who by and large are the people who suffer most from poverty in Africa.<\/p><p>Women, by and large, are the people responsible for carrying out the bulk of subsistence farming.  In the context of farmers, women, by and large, are the small business people who are not necessarily part of the modern money economy.  However, many parts of Africa are now advancing.  I welcome that EU countries generally are beginning to have a fresher and deeper relationship with African countries because Africa is a vibrant continent with a huge population.  The millennium development goals have helped reduce infant mortality, increase girls' access to education and generally widened the scope of third level education.<\/p> <p> In terms of Ireland's participation in the African Development Bank, if we can be assured that it will meet the millennium development goals requirements, I would have no difficulty in supporting it.  However, if this is about mostly men driving around in massive Land Rovers to very poor parts of Africa and spending working people's tax payments in Europe and the rest of the world in a way that simply aggrandises the people in certain types of development agencies and leaves little or nothing behind, I will not welcome it.<\/p> <p> It will be for the Minister, and this Government, to answer how they propose to address that because as a country we spend well over &euro;0.5 billion every year on development in our contributions.  The African Development Bank commitment will be approximately an extra &euro;8 million per year over the coming period.  That is not a major sum in the scale of things but it is important that our development programme should be a quality programme aimed at enhancing the lives of the people who are very poor, particularly women and children, but also enhancing the capacity of African countries across the continent to make provision in a full way for their own people and lead to that period which many African writers and intellectuals have spoken and written about of an African renaissance that we would see in this decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700036#JJ00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543346700,"counter":387,"content":"<p>To conclude the comments I made at the outset on the second amendment to which the Deputies referred, the change in the law this amendment speaks to is necessitated by a specific issue that arose during the course of a review of a freedom of information decision by the Information Commissioner, which in part involved records that are taxpayer confidential.  Under the current provisions of section 851A, officials in the Department of Finance are precluded from providing these records to the Information Commissioner as to do so could constitute a criminal offence.  On the other hand, however, under the Freedom of Information Act there is a statutory requirement to furnish this information to the Information Commissioner and failure to comply may constitute a criminal offence.  That has resulted in a highly unsatisfactory legal position with the conflicting legislative provisions, and prevents the Department providing the records to the Information Commissioner as it wishes to do.  That is the purpose of it.<\/p>  <p>  On the broader discussion about specific amendments, those will be matters for debate on Committee Stage.  Regarding our role in the future with development funds and banks, particularly in Africa and Asia, I am very familiar with the Asian Development Bank and the efforts it is making.  Earlier this year, I was in Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for a few days.  We have a permanent member on the Asian Development Bank, Mr. Gibbons, who happens to be from Kilkenny also but of a famous name, and he explained to me some of the issues Deputy Burton spoke about such as moving away from the big bang infrastructural projects to more people-based projects.  In terms of some of the forms of agriculture, the production in Malaysia of palm, which is something I was not very aware of but is a highly sought after product, has led to a conflict between that industry and environmental issues.  I am aware the Asian Development Bank is examining ways of ensuring that Malaysian farmers will have alternative sources of income and activity into the future.  I agree with the Deputy on that but, ultimately, those will be matters for discussion on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700037#KK00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543346700,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018: Instruction to Committee","time":1543346700,"counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700037#KK00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1543346700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That, pursuant to Standing Order 200, Standing Order 154 is modified to provide that it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that it has power to make provision in the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 in relation to:section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to enhance the effectiveness of the statutory requirement for a plaintiff to serve a notice in writing on the defendant stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her; and section 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to allow for the court to draw inferences from non-compliance with the requirement to lodge a verifying affidavit within 21 days after the lodgement of the service of the pleading concerned, and deduct costs from the party responsible for the failure;and to make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.<\/blockquote><p>The purpose of my remarks is to explain the background to and the need for amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, and the reason they are being tabled by the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018.<\/p><p>Members of the House will recall that the Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, signalled that amendments were being considered to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 on 20 September as part of his Second Stage contribution on the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018.  Both of these amendments arise from key recommendations 6 and 14 contained in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.<\/p><p>I will now give some further information on the amendments.  The first amendment relates to section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  The key aim of this amendment is to reduce the notification period for the serving of a letter of claim from two months to one month.  Its rationale is to align the time period with data protection legislation, which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained - generally, no more than one month.  However, an exception to this rule is where information or CCTV footage is held in the context of an investigation such as a personal injuries claim.  Consequently, by requiring a plaintiff to notify a defendant within one month of an alleged incident under section 8, the defendant is being given the opportunity to identify within the data protection time limits any relevant CCTV footage he or she may have of the incident, and keep it beyond the one month period for investigation purposes where they believe the claim is questionable.  This earlier notification period will also help a defendant prepare his or her defence in a range of other ways such as being able to put together more accurate employee witness statements where this is relevant.<\/p><p>In addition, the working group believes that the existing wording of section 8 needs to be strengthened to ensure it is used more effectively by the courts.  In this regard, it is proposed that instead of a court having the option to draw inferences from the failure to serve a letter of claim on the alleged wrongdoer within the prescribed period of time through the use of the word &quot;may&rdquo;, it should be required to do so as a matter of course through the use of the word &quot;shall&quot;.<\/p><p>Amendment of section 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 proposes the insertion of a new subsection (4A) into section 14 of the Act.  Section 14 deals with the matter of a verifying affidavit in a personal injuries action.  At the time this Bill was being legislated for it was described as a key element of the 2004 Act and was designed to combat false and exaggerated personal injury claims.<\/p><p>The working group concluded that non-compliance with section 14 as a whole is not frequently raised in court as an issue, and no instance of a prosecution or conviction pursuant to section 14 was found.  The working group also took the view that the requirement to lodge an affidavit within 21 days of the service of the pleadings was not unreasonable.  However, it would appear that this regularly does not happen.<\/p><p>Consequently, it proposed a new subsection which would provide for a court hearing a personal injuries action, where there is a failure to lodge an affidavit in court by the deadline set out in the existing subsection (4) to draw inferences and, where it thought it appropriate in the circumstances of the case, to deduct costs from the party responsible for the failure.<\/p><p>The working group hopes that by providing for potential financial consequences to be applied for non-compliance with the procedural requirements, where a court thinks it appropriate, it will force parties to the action to strictly adhere to the requirements set out.  The aim of the working group regarding this amendment is to reinforce the original intention of the provision as a measure to combat fraud and exaggeration in personal injury claims.<\/p><p> In summary, both of the amendments are seen as important for small and medium businesses in particular.  When implemented, they should make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, believe these proposed amendments form important steps in the reform of the overall personal injuries framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700037#KK00500","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543347300,"counter":392,"content":"<p>We support the motion to instruct the committee to enable the Minister to bring forward these amendments on Committee Stage on Thursday, at which time we can have the substantive debate on them.  The Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 is in need of reform.  It is clear that the Minister agrees and his amendments speak to that.  There are issues with the mismatch between the period for notification by a plaintiff to a defendant of an incident and the data protection rules governing the retention of CCTV data, which must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The working group also identified issues with allowing the court the discretion to consider the failure to report an incident within the timeframe.  Merely reducing the two months to one will not resolve this issue but it is movement in the right direction.  We will deal with the substantive issue on Thursday.

We will examine that in more detail on Committee Stage but I would not be surprised if a section of the amendment was challenged in the courts.  I could speak more about that but our time is restricted.<\/p>  <p>  Given the impact of what is proposed, it should have undergone pre-legislative scrutiny.  The report has been available since the start of the year and it should have been scrutinised to give an opportunity to hear from other sides.  I am aware that there is an insurance crisis which involves many factors but the Government seems to be fixated on the issue of fraud, which is an important issue but is not the only one.<\/p>  <p>  At the committee meeting last week, insurers ran rings around the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  It is time to pause and look at the actions.  Why is the insurance industry time and again allowed to block or delay unfavourable measures while pushing ahead with favourable ones?  This is a procedural motion to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage, and I have no issue with that.  While there are issues with the inference that could be drawn from the wording, which we should change from \"may\" to \"shall\", I would like to hear what impact a reduction of the prescribed period from two months to one would have on genuine claims.  The House is united in its view that fraudulent claims need to be stamped out, but there also needs to be prosecution in respect of fraudulent claims.  Suspect claims are coming from notable people but nothing happens.  Other claims are thrown out of court when the judge deems them fraudulent, yet no convictions result.<\/p>  <p>  The question I always ask is: where is the Garda fraud unit?  We were told that there will be a meeting between the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Garda Commissioner.  I made the point time and again, to the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and others, that the idea that a private enterprise would fund a section of the Garda is not right.  It is a precedent we should not establish.  I know it operates in London, but it should not happen here.  We should not allow any private interest to fund a section of our police service.  As I said to the Minister of State, he needs to make it clear on behalf of the Government that it and this House stand foursquare behind the Commissioner in terms of resources and personnel to establish a publicly funded Garda fraud unit.  We should no longer tolerate people walking out of court after chancing their arms in the context of bringing fraudulent cases and knowing they will never be prosecuted, which is what happens.  I would also like to hear an update on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's investigation into cartelism.<\/p>  <p>  These issues will be examined in detail on Thursday.  I am not opposed to them but they are only a part of the picture.  While it is more of a justice issue than a finance issue, it should have been subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, or at least there should have been an option for the committee to tease out the wording of this in written format with other sectors.  We are united in the idea of stamping out fraudulent claims.  There is an issue with how long the video files can be kept, which I understand, but I would like to see what, if any, unintended consequences there are for genuine claimants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700038#LL00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543347300,"counter":394,"content":"<p>We will support the motion on the understanding that we will receive a full and detailed briefing before the debate on Thursday.  These amendments seem to be innocuous at first glance but, on closer inspection, the period in which one may make a claim will be reduced from two months to one.  In the case of genuine claimants, there may be reasons for providing for the longer period.  We need to hear both sides of the argument on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am somewhat concerned about the retention of CCTV footage and the requirement to notify a defendant.  There is an issue with the retention of the data and general data protection regulation, GDPR, is quoted in this context.  I would be extremely disappointed if GDPR became the go-to reason in the public service and other situations for limiting information and access thereto.<\/p>  <p>  Before the matter is discussed in greater detail, I would like us to get a note or a briefing in advance.  I know the civil servants are busy and, therefore, a note will suffice in order that we can examine what is proposed and seek legal advice on it.  These changes are significant and the D&aacute;il has not had an opportunity to discuss them.  They need to be examined in the light of honest claimants - for example, a person who is injured in a genuine accident and who must then make an insurance claim or someone whose car is badly damaged in an accident and who makes a genuine claim - and how their access to the court and their experience in court may be affected.  We must also deal with the issue of fraudulent claims.  As has been stated, it is astonishing that while we frequently read about fraudulent claims in the newspapers, there is never any follow-up or prosecution.  If people are bold enough or criminally minded enough to make what judges describe as fraudulent claims, why is no subsequent action taken against them?  It is important to state that most people are honest and the claims they make are honest.  Insurers' profits are significant or, for most of the insurance cycle, extremely significant because premiums are high.  We need more information about this and I would like it to be supplied to Deputies before we discuss these matters in greater detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700038#LL00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1543347900,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I will try to address some of the issues.  No one has objected to the Motion itself and the Deputies will have opportunities to tease out issues further at Committee Stage.  I share Deputy Doherty's reservation that the insurance industry would directly fund An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as would many Members of the House.  I have discussed this with the Minister and I understand that he is like-minded to a certain extent.  The Deputies will have to tease it out with him at Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton spoke of the timeframe of a month for people to lodge their papers.  I understand that the court would still have discretion in extreme circumstances if, God forbid, somebody was in a coma or incapacitated and could not direct a solicitor, where a judge could consider the circumstances.  Data protection rules require business owners and others to dispose of personal information, in this case, CCTV footage specifically.  It is not inappropriate that we should try to get those two time periods to coincide which is the primary aim of this.  It is also highly appropriate that the affidavit which followed the proceedings would be submitted within three weeks.  Perhaps only anecdotally from my own dealing with the law and from dealing with constituents, but often that time period can be lengthened for any number of reasons.  Those are contributory factors and, as Deputy Doherty said, fraud is not the only reason we have high premiums.  Delays in the legal system and in the processing of claims are a significant contributing factor.

However, there are also parts that are not helpful in the overall sense of trying to establish women's rights which we are trying to amend, which relate to the continued criminality and stigmatisation of abortion by the inclusion of the provision of offences in respect of the intentional ending of the life of the foetus, and also the avoidance of word abortion, which is not mentioned anywhere, and the phrase &quot;access to abortion&quot;.<\/p><p>We believe the Minister's Title does not reflect the purpose of the Bill or the intention of the &quot;Yes&quot; vote which was to provide access to abortion within the Irish healthcare system so that women are not forced to travel or buy abortion pills illegally online.  The problem with the Bill as drafted is that the only reference to access is in the offences section.  Access to health services should mean the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best outcomes for all women, regardless of their geography, economic status or other factors.  What we should say in the Title is that people with disabilities, those in direct provision and those in any form of incarceration must be guaranteed access, and this is not mentioned currently.  They should get the same care and it requires gaining entry to the healthcare system and finding the information through a number of platforms.  They need much more than just a helpline, which we will deal with later.  A helpline is not acceptable to everybody, for instance deaf women cannot access a helpline.  We need to look at access, which is what the referendum was about.  We need healthcare officials to be able to communicate with their patients and so on.  The legislation should be about removing barriers to abortion care.  Therefore, it is very important that the title reflects the tone of what we are doing here.  There was a vote to provide access to abortion.<\/p><p>I know the Minister has said that this is on the advice of the Attorney General who says that it is not in the Constitution so that we cannot use the word, but that is an incredibly weak argument.  Legislation does not have to mirror the Constitution: that argument is absolute nonsense.  The Constitution refers to the dissolution of marriage yet we have the Family Law (Divorce) Act.  Divorce is in our law when it is not in our Constitution, and this is exactly the same thing.  The group, Lawyers for Choice, in particular, has been very clear that the term &quot;access to abortion&quot; that we want to include does not create any inconsistency with the Constitution and, if anything, it reflects the reality and is flexible in terms of access.  People voted against messing around with ambiguous language that created barriers for women and we think that the Title should reflect that.<\/p><p>The Minister has said that if mention of the foetus is removed, that will remove all protection of the foetus because of the eighth amendment but that is not true.  The whole law is framed in the context that the protection of the foetus grows with the foetus, in that we are not providing access to abortion beyond 12 weeks, except in very limited circumstances.  There is a whole raft of protections there and they do not need to be specified in the headline as is the case here.  It is important, particularly given where Ireland is coming from, that we set the tone correctly up front, and the manner in which it is being done does not reflect what Irish people voted on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700039#MM01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1543347900,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Louise O'Reilly next.

Repetition could become a problem as we discuss these matters.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 1 seeks to make clear that the Bill is primarily about access to healthcare, not criminalisation.  Earlier today, Alison Spillane of the Irish Family Planning Association stated that parliamentarians must take the criminal law out of medical consulting rooms and replace it with a provision guaranteeing access to abortion care.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 2 is a reworked version of the earlier Committee Stage amendment which sought to remove &ldquo;Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018&rdquo; as the Title to the Bill and replace it with &ldquo;Health (Access to Healthcare by Women Seeking Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018&rdquo;.

However, there is still much in it that seems to create barriers to access.  I acknowledge the Minister's words on Committee Stage regarding the amendment to which I refer, when he spoke of the need to stick with the phrase \"Termination of Pregnancy\" in the Title due to the fact this is used in the Constitution, as amended by the referendum.  This amendment would retain the phrase \"Termination of Pregnancy\" while also introducing a reference to abortion, specifically &ldquo;Access to Abortion&rdquo;, in the Bill.  On Committee Stage, the Minister also referred to the broader scope proposed in the phrase \"Access to Healthcare by Women Seeking Termination of Pregnancy\" and stated that this might open up the scope of the Bill well beyond its intention.  I accept his point.

We have a difference of opinion on it so I will restate my view.  To be clear, this Bill is enabling legislation that provides for access to abortion and for termination of pregnancy here in our country in a way that has not been the case up to now.  It will allow a woman to access termination of pregnancy in a safe manner in her own community, where possible, and free of charge.  The key provisions of the Bill are exactly the same as that of the draft general scheme approved by Government and published prior to the referendum and the updated scheme made public in July.  In that sense, there are no surprises in terms of what the Title to the Bill is doing, or, indeed, what the Bill is endeavouring to do.<\/p>  <p>  On the reference to ending the life of the foetus, we had this debate on Committee Stage.  The committee would have received a letter from the doctors drawing up the clinical guidelines to say that, regardless of the debate in the House, it is a phrase they find clinically useful because that is how they define the issue clinically.  This is a Bill about access to abortion, of that there is no doubt.  People can lay out all the reasons they want in respect of pejorative terms but the legal advice available to me is that it is better to align the wording in the Bill with that contained in the Constitution.  Given that this is an area which has been subject to so much court adjudication and challenge over so many decades, I, for one, do not intend to take any risk or do anything that would heighten the chance of success of any challenge.<\/p>  <p>  These are technical, legal titles and they reflect accurately what this Bill is endeavouring to do.

As Deputy O'Reilly said, I had an excellent meeting yesterday with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, BeLonG To and with LGBT Ireland to outline to them how this legislation is trans-inclusive but also how I wanted to make sure that was beyond doubt.  It has always been my Department's policy, that of this Oireachtas and my own, that a biologically female individual identifying as a male should enjoy the same rights and liabilities as a woman for the purpose of the legislation.<\/p><p>Section 18(<i>b<\/i>) of the Interpretation Act 2005 is of pivotal importance in ensuring that rights contained in legislation of a gendered nature apply seamlessly to trans people.  It provides in an Act passed on or after 22 December 1993 and in a statutory instrument made after that date that a word importing the feminine gender shall be read as also importing the masculine gender.  As Members and the trans community know, I considered inserting words such as &quot;pregnant person&quot; into the Bill but I have received legal advice, which I have discussed with the trans community, that to do so would create significant risk, as it would have the potential to cast doubt on other gendered provisions in other Bills.  It could open up the possibility for people to argue successfully or otherwise but by implication that references to women or other gendered references in the Statute Book did not appropriately include trans people.  Visibility and inclusivity are important.  Following our Committee Stage engagement and the engagement with the community, I have included in the explanatory memorandum in section 2 definitions the following text: &quot;For the purposes of the Bill a woman is defined in section 2 as meaning a female person of any age, in line with section 18(<i>b<\/i>) of the Interpretation Act 2005, a word importing the feminine gender shall be read as also importing the masculine gender so a biologically female individual identifying as a male will enjoy the same rights and liabilities as a woman for the purposes of this Bill.&quot;<\/p><p>Explanatory memorandums are read and published alongside the legislation.

They seek to modify sections 26 and 27, which were inserted only after the referendum had taken place and, therefore, would not even have been seen by those who read the Bill before the referendum.  They place abortions among special categories of health services not to be charged for.  The Minister has said he does not want cost to be a barrier.  That is an artful way of telling people that they should have to pay for the State-sponsored elimination of the most vulnerable.  We know cost is a barrier to most things, including things that no one would have a moral objection to paying for and, unfortunately, including even forms of necessary medical treatment.  Surely it cannot be that when it comes to the taking of an innocent human life, we are all to be forced to pay for it in every case and for any reason.<\/p><p>I ask Members to think about that and what it is we are talking about forcing people to pay for here.  This is not health care.  Real health care does not have a victim but abortion does.  I want to mention a few facts about the victim who is most affected by it, the one for whom it is the end.  These facts are from the embryology textbook, <i>The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology<\/i>by Drs. Moore, Persaud and Torchia.  I mention this because at times some important points about embryology such as the commencement point of the heartbeat have been denied to suit a particular agenda.  She or he has a heartbeat which begins to beat at three weeks after conception.  Eight weeks after conception, the baby's fingers and toes are distinct and separated and purposeful limb movements first occur at this time, though it is too early for the mother to feel them.  He or she has hands and feet, eyes, ears, arms and legs.  What is to happen to that baby?  What are we expected to compel citizens to pay for?  We are told that after nine weeks the abortions will be surgical abortions.  Section 14 allows abortion for any reason up to 12 weeks.<\/p><p>Dr. Anthony Levatino, an obstetrician who performed 1,200 abortions before changing to a pro-life stance, has explained how a surgical abortion is done up to 13 weeks.  He says:<\/p><blockquote>The suction is then turned on, with a force ten to twenty times more powerful than your household vacuum cleaner. The baby is rapidly torn apart by the suction, and squeezed through this tubing down into the suction machine.<\/blockquote><p>Later abortions, which are provided for in this Bill on broad grounds, particularly under section 11, are even more shockingly brutal.  How can we tell people that they must fund such things?  How could that be anything other than an abuse of public power?  The position of some in government amounts to this: as a condition of being allowed to live and work in this State, they are to be forced continuously to pay for the infliction of fatal acts upon the most vulnerable who have done no wrong.  The despicable injustice of forcing people who cherish human life to pay for babies to be destroyed is simply too plainly obvious for any of us not to see it.  People deeply upset by seeing this State become a place where the law provides for the deaths of the innocent and defenceless should not have foisted upon them the added pain of having their taxes fund that killing.<\/p><p>There are many different views on whether and in what circumstances abortion should be lawful but it is surely reprehensible to force people to pay for the infliction of fatal acts upon innocent, helpless, little human beings.  We should not talk only of the \"No\" voters in this regard.  No one, whether he or she voted \"Yes\", \"No\" or abstained, should be put in such a horrendous position.  It should be remembered that the sections on taxpayer funding for abortions were not even in the Bill before the referendum.  Even those who knew everything that was in the Bill could not have seen them.  A poll conducted since the referendum found that, excluding \"Don't knows\", 59% of adults, including 44% of \"Yes\" voters, opposed the taxpayer funding plan.  Can the Government not find compassion in its heart for people who just want to live their lives without continuously financing abortions?<\/p> <p> Not providing taxpayer funding for abortion will also save lives.  In June 2017, the British Government announced that it would fund abortions for women resident in the North of Ireland.  The official report outlining abortion statistics for England and Wales in 2017 notes that there has been an increase in the number of women from the North of Ireland having an abortion in England and Wales since the funding announcement.  The volume in quarters 3 and 4 of 2017 increased by 42% and 62% respectively compared to the same quarters of 2016.  That is no surprise where a state, knowing the deep and enduring hurt it may cause, presents vulnerable women in crisis with a false, easy answer and then adds that it is free.<\/p> <p> A review of numerous peer-reviewed studies in the USA has shown that the absence of public funding for abortion reduces the number of abortions which take place.  The amendment suggested here is similar to the Hyde amendment, a provision in federal US law which prohibits, with very few exceptions, the federal funding of abortions.  The Hyde amendment has been enacted repeatedly for many years with bipartisan support since its introduction in 1976.  Most states have enacted laws along the same lines as the Hyde amendment.  Dr. Michael J. New notes that the Hyde amendment has been passed every year since 1976 as a rider to the annual federal labour, health and human services appropriations Bills and says it has typically enjoyed support and been signed into law by both Democrat and Republican US Presidents.<\/p> <p> The very fact that the Minister, Deputy Harris, speaks of cost as a barrier shows that he realises free abortions will mean more abortions.  Whether he wants to realise that is another matter.  We need to be given fair play.  As the Minister knows, hundreds of thousands of women voted \"No\" and, like me, they are taxpayers with a conscience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700041#OO00700","speaker":"1440","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543349700,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Reluctantly, as one does not want to get into the graphic, intense debate the last contribution from Deputy Nolan invites, I appeal to her to reconsider the amendment and withdraw it.

She can correct me if I am wrong, but I am sure I have heard Deputy Nolan rail time and time again against the two-tier health service in other areas.  Nevertheless, she advocates a two-tier health service when it comes to women's healthcare in situations where a woman's health and welfare is at stake.  She suggests a financial barrier should be put in the way of a woman making her own choices about how to deal with a situation in which her welfare, health, including mental health, or any other aspect of her wellbeing is at stake.

For the greater part of this year, University Hospital Kerry has been suffering because we cannot pay nurses properly.  Likewise, we cannot pay consultants properly in University Hospital Kerry.  People who cannot pay for hip or knee procedures or for all the other things that go wrong as time and the biological calendar move on are also suffering.<\/p>  <p>  It was said on the radio this morning that we are trying to stall the Bill and take up time.  I reject that.  We are entitled to highlight what we think is wrong with this Bill as much as any Deputy from Mayo, Dublin or anywhere else.  We respect the way the people voted but it is amazing to think that the Minister can find so many millions of euro at the click of a finger with no bother at all.<\/p>  <p>  It is a fact that we are taking people up to Belfast by the busload week after week to allow them to get their sight restored.  There is no bother about arranging the buses but what is wrong and tough is that people have to leave places on the crest of the Atlantic Ocean, including Dingle, Cahersiveen and Valentia Island, in the dark of night to travel that long journey up through the midlands, through Dublin and into the North of Ireland to ensure that for their remaining days they will be able to see the world and see the countryside around them.  We are not providing that service for them in the South of Ireland and I applaud the people who go that distance to try to save whatever bit of life they have left in them.  Some of these people are over 90 years of age and they want their sight to be restored to them but we cannot do it for them here.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister was appointed, we all wished him well.  I said that he was a young man and that I trusted in him to do better than what had been done for the people of Ireland and for the people who needed medical attention before, but to tell the truth he has failed abysmally.  We have asked him time after time to visit University Hospital Kerry but he will not do so and does not care.  Things are in a shocking order there but the Minister does not care and the Government does not care about the health service that it is not providing but it will provide funding for this.<\/p>  <p>  I do not mind if people who cannot pay are assisted in some way but this will ensure that people who have millions of euro can get a free service.  Why can that not apply to the people who want their eyesight restored?  Why does that not apply to the people who want to be able to walk and have the use of their legs, hips or knees again?  There is no hurry about that but this must be in place by 1 January.  Come hell or high water, that is what the Minister wants.  I have the same time to speak as any other Deputy and I am not hogging the airwaves or the speaking time, so do not let any other Deputies say that I am because they are blackguarding when they go out on the airwaves and say things like that.  I am concerned that we are getting people up in the dark of night to travel to get their eyesight restored and we are inviting people to come down here to have abortions in the South of Ireland and we will pay for it.  That is the turnaround we have in this country and I am very worried and disappointed that we are going that way.  It is not about saving people at all but about getting rid of people.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies are hurt when we talk about babies rather than foetuses but when they are 20 or 22 weeks old, they are babies and they are entitled to live.  We asked that if the baby comes out alive, it will get the same attention as a baby over in the maternity ward would get but the Minister rejected that.  When we asked if we could ensure that the little baby would not suffer pain, he rejected that as well.  It is all about rushing this through come hell or high water.  The Government has not even talked to the doctors or the midwives and it has not gotten assurances about anything.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is rushing it through and bullying people into doing this and if they do not do it, they will be fired.  Is that what the Government wants?  Is it wrong for us to stand here and ask that those people who have conscientious objections be given the right to object to carrying out this atrocious act?  They have the right but the Minister does not seem to want to listen and many of his buddies here are helping to rush this through.<\/p>  <p>  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny but the Government does not want to hear about that.  It is case where if a fellow is not saying what the other side is saying, then he should not be talking at all.  I am very hurt and disappointed that we are going down this route of paying to get rid of little babies when we will not pay to look after our people who want to be relieved of pain in many different ways with our health service letting them down.

It is a terrible thing to be forced out of one's county, town or, indeed, country to access healthcare.  It is disgraceful that people have to go by the busload to Northern Ireland to get their eyes or hips treated.  I am sure the Deputy is full of empathy for women, young girls and trans people who for years have been forced onto boats and planes on a daily basis with the stigma, fear and exclusion that go with it.  Very often they have to pay out a hell of a lot of money to do so and very often they have to live with a crisis pregnancy because they do not have the money to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I note the amendments Deputy Nolan is putting down have everything to do with the public purse and very little to do with how an abortion procedure is carried out, but of course most of her speech was dedicated to that and I can see that this is where this debate will go for several Deputies in the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle mentioned that we are 158 democrats and we all have a right to speak.  I absolutely agree with that but the vast majority of people in this country have already said \"Yes\" to abortion rights and we need to address the fine-tuning of a Bill that is long over due.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae says that the Minister is rushing it through but I will defend the Minister, which is something I would not do very often for a Fine Gael Minister, but we have been through a long, 12 week committee process that scrutinised the Citizens' Assembly recommendations which had gone through weeks of same beforehand.<\/p>  <p>  This time last year we were not even sure if we would have a referendum and a year later we are in a position where we are here legislating for abortion in this country.  That is a major and amazing step forward.  All I can say to Deputies who sound as if they want to go on for the next three days about stuff that is not related to the amendments and is irrelevant is that the people in their constituencies have told them by clear majorities that they want legislation for women to have access to abortion in this country.<\/p><p>They did not say they only wanted rich women to have access, therefore, it should not be paid for or allowed through the public health service.  They did not say they only wanted privileged people to have access.  That was not what they were asked.  They were asked to repeal the eighth amendment to ensure that, finally, we could have access to termination and abortion in this country.  That is what this Bill sets out to do.<\/p> <p> I note the empathy for people who have to travel.  I note also the distraction with the raising of other issues that have absolutely nothing to do with people&rsquo;s own amendments &ndash; I am referring to Deputy Nolan &ndash; but it will be a sorry three days for the people of Ireland if we have to listen to people ignoring the democratic will of the people.  The decision was decisive.  It was not ambiguous; there was no if, maybe or people not being sure about it.  We are setting out to act on that here today.<\/p> <p> My last word on the amendment before us and the four later amendments grouped with it, and as was said by other Deputies, is that if we wanted to live in a country that is full of inequalities, we would support these amendments.  We would say that if someone is rich, they can pay for it but if they are not, they will have to either do without it or possibly illegally access the abortion pill on the Internet.  There are some disputes about the figures but between 90% ad 98% of abortions take place before 12 weeks gestation, which means that the pill is safe to cover them.  If the pill is safe to cover them and we do not provide abortion services through the medical service, women, girls and transgender people will access it illegally on the Internet and will, in a lonely space, take that pill and risk their own health.  There is nothing logical, fair or equal about these amendments and I, too, ask the Deputy to withdraw them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700043#QQ00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543350900,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I support the Chairman's remarks made earlier.  Deputy Nolan and everybody has the right to put down whatever amendment they wish.  What they do not have the right to do, however, is put misinformation before the House.  Much of what was said is medically and factually 100% incorrect.  I do not say that simply as a view but on the basis of participating in weeks of discussions and the top-level exposure we were given to medical information, which utterly contradicts much of what was said.  I will not waste time by repeating those points.<\/p>  <p>  This is about access to healthcare, as part of our maternity services.  We are very lucky in this country that despite all the cutbacks women who are pregnant get access to free healthcare, which is incredibly important.  Are we now to put into that scenario a two-tier system where one goes to one's doctor - one might not have children or have a few children, everything might be going great and then something happens and the woman decides she needs a termination in consultation with her doctor - and he says, \"Sorry, you do not have the money, I cannot deal with you so off you go.\"  It does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the arguments made by the Deputies simply do not stack up.  It is unacceptable that we would expect the British state to provide healthcare services for our citizens.  While I appreciate the points made by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, all the problems in health service, which he outlined in terms of eye operations and all the rest, exist now when we do not pay for abortion care.  Clearly, they have nothing to do with whether we provide abortion care.  There are many ways in which we could get this money.  He said that people with millions of euro could get abortions.  People with millions of euro get child benefit but we do not argue against that.  It is a universal payment.  How are we to get the money for the operations?  We might tax them on their income and perhaps Deputy Healy-Rae would support me in our call made previously for a millionaire's tax that would generate some much wanted revenue that could assist in providing these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700044#RR00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1543350900,"counter":445,"content":"<p>This is my first time to speak on the Bill as it has moved from Committee Stage to Report Stage, having contributed to the debate on Second Stage.  We amended the Constitution to the effect that: \"Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy\".  We are now in this Chamber doing that very bidding on behalf of the Irish people.  I disapprove in some shape or form to most of the amendments tabled.  We should stay central to what was published in the heads of the Bill in advance of the referendum to be consistent in interpreting the view of the people, who I believe were very well informed in view of the fact we have been discussing this for a long time, for several generations at this stage.  As to the idea that the public were ill-informed, did not comprehend or were unsure of what they were being asked to vote for, I believe they were very well informed and had been waiting for some time to amend the Constitution to allow us to legislate.  In doing that, there is an onus on us all to adjudicate on each other's opinions and views, peruse the amendments and go through a process that does justice to the views of people in how they expressed them in the recent referendum.  With that in mind, the debate among the broader public was a very respectful.  We would be doing ourselves a disserve if we descended beyond where we are now in terms of having proper robust scrutiny of the  legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we consider the amendment before us which, effectively, proposes that no public moneys shall be provided by the Oireachtas for the provision of terminations except in the context of sections 10 and 11.  What Deputy Nolan is proposing is that we would insert in law a means testing by fiat, by legislation effectively, ensuring this service would be available only to those who could afford to procure an abortion, which the people now accept needs to be available to women in certain cases, thereby being the preserve of the rich.  If we start to debate these particular issues in this tone we are bringing the discourse to a level that I had hoped we would not reach.  I do not say that lightly because I respect everybody's view and have consistently tried to take the politics out of it to get to where we are.<\/p>  <p>  At some stage one has to say that if we were to continue the discussion on this amendment and allow it further passage through the parliamentary process, we would be enshrining in law that some women are automatically deemed second class in terms of access to healthcare in this country.  We should bear in mind that this is primarily around the provision of abortion services in the first 12 weeks without cause but for a reason, whatever reason that may be.  That is entirely a matter for the woman and her medical team; it is not for us to interpret.  Beyond that, we have put extra provisions in place providing for it only in the context of a risk to the life or the health of the woman, or in the context of fatal foetal abnormalities.  I would find it difficult for anybody to suggest that it would be only rich people, or those who can afford it, who would be able to access a termination in those contexts when they may have many reasons they can no longer continue with the pregnancy.  For us to move this debate in a way that respects the views of the people, I suggest these types of amendments be withdrawn to allow us go about passing the Bill as envisaged in the heads of the Bill published in advance of the referendum.<\/p>  <p>  To put it into context, Savita Halappanavar died on 28 October 2012.  We had debates in this House and it was amazing how people's views outside this House can be formed by what we say inside it.  What I found very uncomfortable at that time was some of the public discourse around the late Savita Halappanavar.  What was said about that woman after she died in a Galway hospital was distasteful to the point where I did not believe people could descend so low.  I say that because I want to put on the D&aacute;il record that I took several phone calls from people at that time because I was my party's spokesperson on health.  What was said to me about Savita Halappanavar was shocking and appalling by people who had a medical background or licences to practice in this State.  What they said to me was beyond belief.  They were trying to cast aspersions on her character, her good name and all the reasons she sought a termination when the only time she sought a termination was when she was dying.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, she is dead now.  When we are talking about the subject, we have to be conscious of the many thousands of women across this country who have had to avail of that for whatever reason.  People can judge.  I will not.<\/p> <p> It is very difficult for me to put a cost on a woman having to get up at 4 a.m. to get a plane to Birmingham or Manchester for a termination of a pregnancy, for whatever reason.  Having listened to the people who had to go there because they were carrying a child with a fatal foetal abnormality and felt they could no longer continue with that pregnancy, I think the State should be obligated to support that family in that decision.  I believe that because it is a healthcare issue and because women make these choices for many and varied reasons, which will always be within the law if we pass this Bill, the State should be obligated to provide healthcare to any women from whatever financial background or for whatever reason she decides to terminate that pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700044#RR00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543351500,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I will oppose this amendment.  We have come a long way to this stage.  When it started, I was not sure that we would get here but after 35 years of debate, the Citizens' Assembly, the Oireachtas committee, the referendum and people's vote, the Select Committee on Health and contributions in this Chamber, it is fair to say that we are all fairly well-informed and the public is as informed as we are.  I think there is a sinister motive behind the suggestion that by not funding abortions, we will somehow save lives.  That suggests to me that by not funding abortions, we will deprive women of lower means of access to services, forcing them to remain pregnant against their will, regardless of the situation.  That is control of women by financial means, which is the wrong approach.  Regardless of Deputy Nolan's personal views, the suggestion that the Deputy would control a woman's access to these services because she cannot afford to pay for them, because the Deputy believes it is right or wants to achieve a restriction on abortion and will use money to do so, is wrong on many levels.  I think Deputy Nolan is exploiting impoverished and vulnerable women.  Not every woman has financial independence.  She may not have a medical card but that does not mean she has access to the funds she needs, for whatever reason.  We do not know specific domestic situations but we know people are in those circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  For a Deputy who has advocated that there should not be inequality, that there has been a two-tier access to health services and inequality in many areas of society, to advocate that she would discriminate against women on the basis of a socioeconomic background and how much money they have is wrong.  It is a perverse way of imposing a personal view on other women.  I respect that Deputy Nolan's views are sincerely held personal views, trying to impose them on other women by using financial means is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Think about the inequity in that and the impact of such an amendment.  What about a young girl who may not be working and does not have money?  We do not know why she is in those situations.  What about a young girl who may have been impregnated due to incest?  Where is she supposed to get the money to pay for the service?  What about a woman who may be in a very difficult domestic situation where her partner is the problem and she does not have financial independence?  We do not charge for maternity services.  They are health services.  Why would this be different?  It is part of maternity services.  If they cannot access a termination due to cost, does Deputy Nolan think that woman, having really thought about this and being in a situation where she needs to access those services will, because we erect a financial barrier, sit back and get on with it?  Is she accessing the service because it is a little easier?  That does a disservice to women and is quite insulting to the process she has gone through to get to the point of making that decision.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Nolan clearly fundamentally disagrees with abortion in pretty much all circumstances but the fact is that the people of this country voted to provide services.  The Deputy says they did not vote to pay for abortion services.  I would counter that by saying that citizens did not vote to discriminate between women who are poor and women who are wealthy, for inequality and to erect barriers to the most impoverished and vulnerable women in society.  Citizens did not vote for the intention of this amendment.  Trying to restrict a woman's choice by financial means is imposing one's personal view through a backdoor and is trying to undermine the very real, sincere and well-informed vote that took place last May.  Citizens knew what they were voting for and that women needed services.  They are well aware that even now, women are still travelling every week and accessing services in another jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate that a number of Deputies who are in a minority are unhappy with the result of the referendum, it happened and that vote stands.  It is as valid as any other referendum that has taken place.  The legislation was put before the people and they knew what was intended to go through this House.  To come into this Chamber and seek to materially and substantially amend the legislation because one is not happy with it, and to implement this method of control and restrict access for women without the financial means to access services, is anti-women, anti-choice and seeks to exploit the real inequalities in our society.  Many women would not be able to afford these services if they were charged for.  That is a fact.  It seems to be suggesting that if the Members supporting this can somehow restrict women or force them to remain pregnant, they will get what they want and that it does not matter about the women affected, the vote, the people's will or what is right for the women, since they will get what they want no matter what it takes.  It does not matter if they have to use unequal means to get there, money as a way of restricting women or if they have to seek to exploit their very difficult circumstances, whether they are very young, unemployed or in a very difficult domestic situation.  If they have to exploit that, that is what they will do.  That is what this amendment says to me.  It is important that we look at the impact of such an amendment.  I appreciate the Deputy's personal views but to seek to exploit the financial inequalities in this country to force her own views and restrict access goes against the spirit of the people's vote last May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700045#SS00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1543351500,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Deputy Nolan's amendment ensures that taxpayers' money will not be used to fund abortions except in situations of risk to the mother's life and I certainly support it.  The rationale for this amendment is clear.  It is not what Deputies have tried to say, hijacking it and claiming all other kinds of intentions.  The amendment simply respects the choice and convictions of people who do not wish to have any involvement with abortions, by ensuring that they are not continuously forced to pay for the taking of innocent human life.  Anyone can appreciate that.  Whatever differing views people may have about whether abortion should be legal, compelling people, especially those who believe that all human life should be protected, to pay for the killing of the most vulnerable is disgraceful.  If this amendment is accepted, as I believe it should be, there will still be nothing in the Bill to prevent those who wish to pay for abortions from doing so.  The amendment simply prevents people from being forced to pay for abortions that they do not believe in.  For the Oireachtas to exercise such compulsion in respect of people would be a cruel and oppressive disregard of the right of persons to refrain from involvement in abortions.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The prospect is outrageous and is a mark of striking intolerance for the right of a person at the very least to stay out of the taking of human life.  To create a situation whereby all who live and work in Ireland cannot avoid paying for such killing is profoundly wrong.  It is no answer to say only a small percentage of public expenditure will go to fund abortions.  The gross injustice of forcing citizens to pay for abortions remains regardless of the exact amount, and the Bill in its current form provides for taxpayer funding of the full cost of abortions in all cases, even for abortions under 16 weeks that can be performed for any reason.<\/p> <p> The Am&aacute;rach Research polling in the wake of the referendum showed that, excluding those who stated they did not know, 59% of adults in Ireland, including 44% of \"Yes\" voters, oppose taxpayer funding of abortions.  Of course, the referendum vote was for a change to the Constitution.  Lest the naysayers here say we do not accept that, of course we accept it.  We are democrats, elected by the people for the time being.  However, the referendum was not a mandate for everything in the Bill.  It was to delete the eighth amendment and we were to legislate here.  It is shocking that people are not allowed to table amendments.  We are allowed do so and to debate them here without being ridiculed for our views and for representing those views here fairly and squarely.<\/p> <p> As I have said, taxpayer funding of abortions was not inserted in the Bill until after the referendum was held.  Much has been said about people reading the Bill before the vote.  There was nothing about taxpayers funding abortions inserted in the Bill until after the referendum.  This is very clear and factual.  There was nothing about this prior to the referendum so how would people have known about the intention to fund it?  This is why so many people told the Am&aacute;rach Research pollsters they were opposed to the funding.  This is not the only thing they were not told.  Many things were said and told and untold but history will have to judge that.<\/p> <p> Declining to provide public funding for abortions also saves a great many lives.  A range of peer review studies from the US, where the use of public moneys to fund abortions is generally prohibited at federal level and in most US states, shows the absence of public funding for abortions reduces the number of abortions.  In June 2017, the British Government announced it would fund abortions for women resident in Northern Ireland.  The official report on abortion statistics for England and Wales in 2017 noted an increase in the number of women from Northern Ireland having an abortion in England and Wales since the funding announcement.  The volume in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 increased by 46% and 62%, respectively.  If this is not evidence, what is?  Adopting this amendment, therefore, is also in line with the Government's pre-referendum assurances that abortion would be safe and rare if legalised.  That has gone out the window.<\/p> <p> I respect what Deputy Clare Daly said about the right to table amendments and others attacking the amendment.  I salute Deputy Nolan for being courageous and brave enough to table this amendment.  She is a mother and a caring person.  Deputy Kelleher mentioned the late Savita Halappanavar.  Her name was used and misused.  We all got phone calls and we must deal with that.  Her name was hugely used in the referendum campaign in spite of the fact that three reports commissioned by the State found she died from medical neglect.  The Minister can shake his head all he likes.<\/p> <p> I want to mention fatal foetal abnormality.  I travelled to Geneva with a number of women who had diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality.  We travelled to the United Nations in an effort to get that horrible terminology disused and we had great success.  The Minister's HSE, of which he is so proud, has in the main disbanded the terminology and is using \"life-limiting conditions\", which is much more humane and respectful of the parents and their little unborn babies and born babies.  I have met some of them.  Some of them live for weeks.  Some live for days, hours or weeks.  One is 11 now and living in County Cavan.  I have met many who received that cruel diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality.  They did not get perinatal hospice or support here.  We asked in talks on forming a government for Fine Gael to roll-out a perinatal hospice service but it fell on deaf ears, like all of the other questions we have on healthcare for women and their babies.  It is not there.  All of sudden, the Minister has money and manna from heaven to pay for everything.

Many people on this side of the debate feel the Bill is shocking.  The Bill itself gives a definition of termination of pregnancy as the ending of the life of a foetus.  For many people this is a very difficult and sobering issue to have to deal with.  We have been told for years we need to have a debate on abortion but any time a person discusses an abortion, they are closed down in the particular debate.  If we are to have a debate on these issues, we need to tolerate people from different sides of the Chamber discussing and representing their views fairly.  This debate will be held over the next three days and we should not call each other names.  I do not second-guess the motivation of anybody on the other side of the Chamber.  If anybody has a radically different view on this issue, I take it as read that his or her view is designed and comes from a human rights and compassionate space.  Members should not continuously second-guess the motivations on this side of the Chamber either.  To be honest, people spent so much time on Committee Stage second-guessing each other's motivations that it added at least another three or four hours to the debate and I imagine the pro-choice side did not have that as an objective.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that a large majority of people voted for repeal.  They were asked a binary question and it is pretty much impossible when asked a binary question to give a view on all the detail of a particular Bill.  A large minority voted \"No\".  A total of 723,000 people voted \"No\", which is more than voted for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, the Socialist Party and the Social Democrats combined in the most recent election.  It is a voice that is entitled to be articulated in the Chamber.  We have been debating this for more than an hour and 20 minutes and only three pro-life voices have been heard and all of them have been attacked for what they have said on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700046#TT00600","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1543352100,"counter":455,"content":"<p>We are all pro-life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700046#TT00700","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1543352100,"counter":456,"content":"<p>We will get through the Bill faster if people fully respect each other's motivations.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that minorities have a voice in the Chamber because if the Chamber does not reflect in some way the views that exist among the public, it will be a very dangerous place to be.  Healthy respectful opposition is important in a functioning democracy.  It is not the enemy in this debate.  To be honest, many parties here have minority mandates.  If they do not agree that a minority should have a voice here, surely the smaller parties should fold up their tents.  The idea that we have to abide by the majority view is nonsense.  We have to be able to give voice to the people on both sides of the debate outside the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  I was surprised by this issue being raised during the debate because my focus was on making sure we left no mother or child behind.  I was surprised that after the debate was over, people came up to me on the street who were shocked by the fact they would have to pay for these abortions.  I thought it was very much a minor issue in comparison to the major issue of abortion itself but that is the way of the world.  That is what people's fears are about.  Most of the fears relate to the issue of opportunity cost.  There is always an opportunity cost.  If we take &euro;12 million out of a particular budget to pay for this, it will mean certain operations will not happen.  It will mean some people will not get the healthcare to which they are entitled.<\/p><p> We are told that the State should not seek to control people on a socioeconomic basis.  This Government controls people every day on a socioeconomic basis.  It denies healthcare to hundreds of thousands of people on that basis.  Some 2,500 children are waiting more than a year for their first mental health clinic appointment because of the control of the Government for socioeconomic reasons.  It is incredible that people are travelling today for healthcare while at the same time money can be prioritised for abortion.  Healthcare has different meanings for people.  My belief is that healthcare saves lives and does not create preventable deaths.  That is the difficulty with this.<\/p> <p> If it were my amendment I would not have drafted it in that fashion.  I would have sought to give people a conscientious objection or a freedom of conscience with regard to how their tax money is spent.  If one pays for an operation like this, one is involved in the delivery of the operation and many constituents will feel that this operation is morally unjust.  To force them to pay for something they do not agree with is not right.  I have no desire to deny healthcare to anybody.  Healthcare should be free at the point of delivery on the basis of need, not on the basis of income.  I also believe, however, that people should be able to object in a conscientious fashion to the spending in which they are involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700046#TT00800","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543352700,"counter":458,"content":"<p>As Members know, I was a strong pro-life Deputy prior to the referendum and I remain a strong pro-life Deputy.  I have spoken on this at every opportunity but I have always tried to be as dignified and thoughtful as possible.  The people spoke clearly and emphatically last May.  It took me a while to accept that decision but I have accepted it.  I cannot support this amendment.  If a young girl or woman is in trouble, perhaps because she is in an abusive relationship or feels she cannot continue the pregnancy, I could not support her not having access to the termination of the pregnancy, if that is what she wants.  It is not what I would want but it is what she wants.  We have a two-tier health system and we are trying to move away from that with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am afraid that if we do not support people we would probably end up with more illegal abortions and more people accessing abortion pills online down the road, which is what we are trying to avoid.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have a question for the Minister.  It was reported in the media recently that a GP will be paid approximately &euro;450 to provide abortion services for the termination of pregnancy and aftercare.  Subsequent reports in the newspapers show that a GP is paid, and I accept this could be wrong, approximately &euro;250 for the care of a pregnant woman for nine months of pregnancy and her aftercare.  Can the Minister confirm these figures?  If they are correct, why is there such a variance in cost between providing the termination of a pregnancy and providing the care of a mother for nine months and her aftercare?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700047#UU00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1543352700,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to something I already pointed to at another briefing today.  It is the unfair press release from a colleague stating that Deputies were engaged in delaying tactics in the House.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  With regard to the amount of time in which every Member spoke on Committee Stage, nobody spoke for a minute longer than the person needed.  Everybody had points to make.  If we had not done that we would rightly be accused of being neglectful in doing our job where we have something to say, if we have a question, if we wish to query an amendment or if we wish to support, amend or object to an amendment.  One person came out today and cast an aspersion on every Member of the House by saying that a Member who is not supporting the legislation wholeheartedly as it goes through the House is to be seen as objecting to it.<\/p>  <p>  When the vote took place I gave a commitment at the outset that I would not do anything to obstruct the legislation passing through the House because that is what the people had voted for.  However, to say that one should not be allowed to question, propose amendments, speak on amendments or make one's views known is ridiculous.  That is an attempt to stifle democracy.  It is saying that anybody who does not agree with me should keep their mouth shut and not do their job.  It will take more than one person from a political party to stop me doing my job.  I am here to represent people and I will do that to the best of my ability in a workmanlike way at all times.  Nobody from a political party will stop me or any of my friends from doing that.<\/p>  <p>  The most striking feature of Committee Stage was the sheer avalanche of amendments put forward by supporters of the Bill and advocates of abortion on demand.  For months we have been told that we must get on with it, respect the verdict of the people, that the proposals put to the people before the referendum must be respected and that proposed amendments to the Bill be kept to a minimum.  What happened instead?  Over 150 amendments were put forward by supporters of the Bill.  Each of them had the aim of watering down the already weak or token restrictions contained in the Bill.  An amendment was proposed in respect of every section, subsection and almost every line of the Bill.  Put simply, those who were calling for the verdict of the people to be respected have systematically set about tearing the Bill to shreds and introducing a regime which would be more liberal than the extremely liberal proposals in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  They are repeating that on Report Stage with over 70 proposed amendments that seek to gut the Bill and make the legislation even more liberal than what was promised by the Government early in the year.  That is what is happening.  Do I agree with that?  They are perfectly entitled to do so.  To return to the point I made earlier, if people wish to do that they are entitled to do so.  Other Members have a different opinion, as I do, and are worried that the people get what they voted for and not a watered down version of it.  I know many people who voted for the legislation but they are not happy now because they see the Minister and others running away with it and trying to make something of it which is not what they said they wanted.  During the campaign the Minister made promises and certain commitments which he appears to have thrown out.  When he was asked about this at earlier meetings he completely forgot what he had promised the people when they were going to vote.  Again, people can say that is politics.

I will try to outline the reasons for this.  I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak because it is part of democracy to get to speak in the Parliament.  Many have tried to stifle that here tonight, but they certainly will not stifle me.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken to many people on the issue, I put it to the Minister that the people were not aware their taxes would be funding the procedures that would end the most innocent lives in Irish society.  With regard to abortion clinics, or hospitals, in a poll last August up to 60% of respondents claimed they did not want their taxes paying for abortions.  That is a huge number of people, and it is people who were not aware of this situation when they went to vote in the referendum.  I listened to many Deputies who spoke here tonight.  Some of them were very respectful while others were questionable.  One Deputy said that we do not know what a woman's financial situation is.  I accept that we do not know this.  We do not know anybody's financial situation but I certainly know about the thousands of women, men and children and their financial situation when they are looking for an emergency procedure they cannot have because the State cannot afford to give it to them.  That is a very serious issue and it is probably why there much frustration among the public.  While some people voted for abortion they did not vote to pay for the abortion and now they feel that they will be paying for these procedures.<\/p>  <p>  I met many people along the route throughout this campaign and, being honest, most of them were against it.  Obviously they would have known where I came from on the issue, but in my clinic I also met people who were for abortion.  I was respectful to them and they were respectful to me.  I gave them the opportunity to give their views and I listened to them very carefully, in the same way I respect people who listen to me tonight and who give me the opportunity to speak.<\/p>  <p>  We have to look at other countries that have and pay for abortions because Ireland does not have abortion.  One person who had done much research on abortion told me that in the UK, a huge percentage, which I believe is 40% - unfortunately I did not write down the percentage - of women have a second abortion.  The state pays for the second abortion also and I assume that will happen here too.  In many cases in the UK, a high percentage of women have had up to eight abortions.  I do not like this.  There are two issues.  The first is that I do not believe the state wants to pay for continuous abortions.  The other aspect is that I hope information and statistics are being kept on these women because some might be abused and perhaps they are being forced into having the abortions.  If a women is having numerous abortions, then something is wrong.  I hope this statistic would be there to protect the woman.  I do not believe that this information is being recorded in the UK.  It could be the case that a partner is forcing a woman to have an abortion.  It is a high percentage and it needs to be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae is right.  Bantry General Hospital cannot afford to have a consultant.  People are desperately in need of continuing medical procedures, yet we cannot afford it.  We can, however, afford the many millions of euro the Minister has put aside for this measure.  There was no consultation with the D&aacute;il but a phenomenal amount of money is being put aside for these procedures.  It is we, the taxpayer, who will have to fork out.  That would be fine if we saw equality and that other people were not suffering.   While it is great that every week busloads of people are taken abroad to get their cataracts, hips and knees done, because it cannot be done in the State, that is done to help them and to make sure they have a quality of life, so that they can have their sight back and so that perhaps they will not suffer later on with mental health issues.  It is not the loss of a lovely little child.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made by a Deputy to a businessman backing us.  The Deputy many have meant all of us but I certainly have no businessman or businesswoman behind me.  We have put forward these amendments and we have been very respectful throughout this debate, be it in this House or in committee.  We put forward the least number of amendments.  We were the ones who were supposed to be disruptive and the ones who were going to filibuster.  We are not filibustering and we did not put forward the dozens of amendments that were brought forward by those who support abortion.  They are entitled to do that, but we put forward a limited number of amendments, of which this is one.  I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on it.  The Minister said that he had engaged with transgender groups on the Bill, and there is nothing wrong with that.  We would like to have had extra meetings prior to this matter going to the health committee.  Deputies asked for that but were refused.  I am aware of medical people who also requested meetings with the Minister but they were refused.  We now find ourselves in a crisis because many of them do not want to administer this procedure.  About a week and a half ago, I went to a meeting to which the Minister invited me and I appreciated the opportunity to go.  I raised three questions and not one was answered at that meeting.  The Minister, however, did everything in his power to answer every other question posed by those who supported and who wanted to bring in the Bill.  I waited for answers but I did not get them.  I was not going to bend over backwards.  I put the questions forward and the Minister wrote them down but he did not get to them.<\/p>  <p>  I will support this amendment and a number of others.  I will certainly not be filibustering but I will take the opportunity to speak.  I do not believe the people wanted their taxes to pay for abortions.  It is millions of euro that should be spent on the people who are losing their eyesight, suffering severe pain in their hips or who need other procedures, which are not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700048#VV00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1543353300,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I enter the debate this evening with something of a heavy heart.

That is not going to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the result of the referendum and emphasise that it is not a result I would have wished for or supported.  I recognise the democratic voice of the people that has resulted in this legislation.  I am aware from the arithmetic of the House that the Bill will be passed quite comfortably.  The challenge for Deputies such as me is to make sure, insofar as possible, that the Bill addresses the concerns raised with us, that it is scrutinised and that it is as good as it can be.  There are some 60 amendments before us on Report Stage.  We will be supporting the amendments that offer greater protections to the unborn child and to the mother.  We will not be supporting amendments that try to expand the services or try to go beyond what was originally envisaged.<\/p><p>I wish to comment on this amendment specifically in respect of the money and provision of services.  I was very taken with the contribution of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, where he talked specifically about how people who had voted against the referendum do not want to be complicit or to have their taxes seen as part of the provision of abortion services.  He made a very good point.  I have been listening to the debate with an open mind and I have considered this point.  However, the majority of people did vote for this measure.  More importantly, if we do not provide an equal service to all people, what does that mean?  Either people will avail of the services in terms of the legislation we pass as funded by the State or, if they cannot afford it, they will find alternative services.  My concern is that the welfare of the unborn child and of the mother will not be enhanced or advanced by passing this amendment.  I also have a concern that in respect of the legislation we are trying to refine and improve, the 72-hour reflection period, would not be availed of by somebody who might go for a termination in another process rather than through the State system.  Having reflected on it and having been taken with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's contribution, I will not be supporting the amendment.  While I will contribute to debate one or two of the other provisions in respect of enhancing the protection for the unborn child, I will not in any way be delaying or frustrating this Bill despite that fact that I have not been supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700048#VV00400","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543353900,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I would like to speak directly to amendment No. 4.  It provides that &quot;No public moneys shall be provided by the Oireachtas to pay for the carrying out of a termination of pregnancy other than a termination of pregnancy in accordance with <i>section 10<\/i>or <i>11<\/i>in a case where there is a risk to the life of a pregnant woman.&quot;  Let us consider that for a moment.  Section 10 is a definitions section and section 11 concerns the risk to the life or serious risk to the health of the mother.  The amendment rules out serious risk to health.  It provides that public funding cannot be used for a healthcare service except expressly under one section of the Bill, where the woman's life is at risk.  The amendment does allow explicitly for public money to be used for termination of pregnancy.  What it states it that public money cannot be used where there is a serious risk to health under section 10.  It also provides that public money cannot be used under section 12, which covers a risk to the life of the mother or serious threat to the health of the mother in an emergency.  It provides that public money can be used if there is a non-urgent risk to the life of the mother but cannot be used if there is an urgent risk to the life of the mother.  That is what the amendment states when it provides that public money can only be used in accordance with sections 10 and 11.  That is what we are being asked to vote for here.<\/p><p>The amendment also provides that public money cannot be used under section 13, which is in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality.  Let us think about that for a second.  The amendment does not lay down a principle that public money cannot be used.  It says public money can be used but only in the case of a non-urgent risk to the life of the mother.  In a case of urgent risk to the life of the mother, it cannot be used.  In the case of fatal foetal abnormality it cannot be used, because that is provided for under section 13.<\/p><p>Let us think this through for a second.  A pregnant woman and potentially her partner receive devastating news that they are dealing with a fatal foetal abnormality.  This amendment proposes that in that case, they must pay for all the medical support themselves.  We are talking about repeated trips to a GP, as well as about potentially very expensive medicines, all manner of rehab, hospital visits, visits to consultants and obstetricians, medical procedures in operating theatres and who knows how much aftercare support.  We could be talking about tens of thousands of euro.  The cost of supporting a woman or parents who are dealing with a fatal foetal abnormality could be tens of thousands of euro.  This amendment provides that a woman and possibly her partner who receive this devastating news and who choose to stay in their own country, as opposed to going to the UK, which will provide and pay for the service, will be faced with a bill from the hospital that could be &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000.  What do hospitals do when people do not pay?  They refer those debts on to debt collectors.  The actual implication of voting for this amendment could be that people who want to be parents and are dealing with the catastrophic news of a fatal foetal abnormality could end up with debt collectors coming after them for bills of in excess of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 if they choose to stay in their own country.  That is what this amendment actually proposes to enshrine in the law in Ireland.

On 27 October 1967, abortion was passed in the UK.  On 27 April 1968, abortion came into effect in the UK.  From 1968 to 2014, a total of 8,745,508 abortions were performed.  According to the World Health Organization, between 40 million and 50 million abortions are estimated to be taking place every year, which is 125 abortions every day.  The reason I am giving these figures is that I am very concerned at what is going to happen in Northern Ireland.  In 2017, the UK Government announced that it was going to publicly pay for abortions in Northern Ireland.  Since that has been introduced, there has been between 40% and 60% of an increase in abortions in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I am concerned that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is trying to find a way to pay for residents in Northern Ireland to have abortions in Ireland.  I fear what is going to happen in this country.<\/p> <p> As one of my colleagues said earlier, in the wake of the referendum it has been shown that 59% of the people of Ireland are opposed to the taxpayer funding this.  The Bill as it stands provides for the full cost to be carried by the taxpayers.  We are forcing our taxpayers to pay for the abortions.  I fear for this country.  Ireland used to be one of the safest countries in the world to have a child.  Now all of a sudden my big fear is that what happened in Northern Ireland will happen in the Republic of Ireland.  We are opening a floodgate to have abortion on demand in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700049#WW00600","speaker":"1441","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543354500,"counter":476,"content":"<p>While I do not agree with the amendment, I understand the meaning behind it.  Certain people in this Chamber and outside are so fundamentally opposed to abortion in any circumstance that they do not want to be complicit in it in any way at all, and that includes contributing their taxes to it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly has pointed out the flaw in the amendment.  If there is an immediate risk to the life or health of the woman, she would fall outside the scope of this amendment.  However, outside that it is rubbish to suggest that if we pass this amendment and everyone has to pay for abortions we will have extra money in the morning for our health service to fund extra hip replacements, extra cataract operations, etc.  The World Health Organization - not me or some doctor - has stated that 7 million women worldwide are admitted to hospitals as a result of unsafe abortions every year.  The World Health Organization states that cost is a barrier to safe abortions.  If we start to charge women, the World Health Organization states that it will lead to an increase in unsafe abortions.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organization put a cost on the 7 million women admitted to hospital as a result of unsafe abortions.  It costs $600 million a year to treat women who have had unsafe abortions.  The best way for us to have safe legal abortions is to make them free.  All the evidence supports that.  Charging for it results in increasing the number of unsafe abortions, which has an impact on the health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700050#XX00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1543354500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>My view on the taking of human life is well known.  Whether that is a human life in the first nine months of its existence or afterwards, I have always been consistent on the protection of human life and I intend to go on that way.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, people will find that statistically the most dangerous place for a human being will be in the womb.  That is a certainty if the Bill is passed, which it will be.<\/p>  <p>  We are discussing amendment No. 4.  I have heard two arguments, one for it and one against it.  The one against it is why should those who have a fundamental objection to the taking of life of the unborn have to fund it through their taxes.  The counterargument runs that if the amendment is passed, abortions would still take place, but there will effectively be a means test on it between those who are well off and those who are less well of.  We are being put in a totally invidious position which is why I voted as I did on Second Stage.  Once we get this far, we are getting into impossible conundrums.  I never like that those who can pay can get access while those who cannot pay cannot get access.  Even if the amendment were passed, would it actually change anything in terms of abortion?  The reality is that it would not and furthermore it would put a financial strain on those who could least afford it to avail of what will inevitably be a service that is legal.<\/p>  <p>  I raised this previously when we were talking about public money.  I find it surprising that for years our maternity services, which were focused on two patients all along, were crying out for money to provide a safer, better service.  They were told all the time that we could not afford it because of hard times, but suddenly we can find a large pot of money for abortion.  In his reply I ask the Minister to outline the requests that have been made over the past three or four years by the health service for extra money to be allocated to maternity services to ensure that scans and other services would be available uniformly across the country.  What money was sought for 2019 and what money has been given?  There is something strange in not focusing on the protection of the mother and the child by having comprehensive good-quality maternity services in non-crowded maternity facilities throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  On the cost issue Deputy Donnelly mentioned, can the Minister confirm to me that no matter how long people spend in a hospital, it cannot cost them more than &euro;800 in the public system in any one year?  Certainly the rules I have read indicate that.  It is important that we confirm that point.  It frightens people.  In my office I see many people who have lost their medical card or their GP-visit card.  They have a fear of getting bills of thousands of euro if they end up in hospital.  These are cases where an appeal will not work.  I often have to print out the rules showing that that particular American scenario does not happen in our health service.  A patient can get a heart transplant, cancer treatment and anything else in one year in a public hospital, as long as he or she can get in past the trolleys, and it costs &euro;800 in total.  I ask the Minister to confirm that on the record because it is a point that needs affirming.<\/p>  <p>  I will support many other amendments to the Bill.<\/p><p>I will not support this particular one because it divides those with resources and those without resources.  It does not deal with the fundamental issue I have with the Bill.  However, I will be supporting other amendments.<\/p> <p> On the argument about faulty wording of amendments, most amendments put down by Opposition parties are technically faulty.  The position normally is that if a Minister accepts one's amendment in principle, he or she will say they cannot accept the amendment because the wording is faulty but will come back on Report Stage with an amendment that does the job.  In terms of the fine combing of these amendments, what is actually happening is that, in principle, the majority of the D&aacute;il will push these two amendments, not because of a minor wording difficulty, and good luck to them.  I am the first to recognise democratically that the overwhelming majority of the D&aacute;il would support this Bill.  However, it is important that people who have a differing view would accept the principle of some amendments tabled here that we believe should have been taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700050#XX00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543355100,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I want to express my opposition in particular to amendment No. 4, which is really an attempt to turn back the clock.

Let us be very clear so that there is no mystery here.  What we are trying to do with this Bill is make abortion care in Ireland free, safe and legal.  There is a direct correlation between the words \"free\" and \"safe\".  If we want people to be able to access termination of pregnancy with medical support, we need to make it a universal service as many Deputies, including Deputy Butler and others who came at this debate during the referendum from a very different perspective to mine, honestly admitted.  Otherwise, we will divide women in this country.  We will provide certain women with access to medically-supervised termination and have a situation where women who cannot afford that continue to access unsafe and illegal abortion without any medical support.  That is what we are trying to do here.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Chambers rightly said that pregnant women in this country do get free healthcare.  Are we really suggesting that different women should get different types of free healthcare depending on the choice they make?  Will we not respect the fact that pregnant women get to make that choice?  We do not just provide free GP care if someone makes a choice that certain people in this House approve of but that we provide that free healthcare for all pregnant women.<\/p>  <p>  I find it frustrating when I hear the argument that only when we live in some sort of perfect world and have addressed all the other ills and challenges that we face societally can we look after women in crisis.  In other words, come back to us when nobody in Ireland is waiting for a cataract operation or a replacement hip operation.  Why do women in crisis have to come last?  They have come last in this country for far too long.  The women of Ireland and those who love the women of Ireland spoke out very clearly in wanting that to no longer be the case.  That is what this Bill is trying to do.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, the irony is not lost on me, the women of Ireland or the partners of the women of Ireland that those who agitate about the reason people have to travel to Northern Ireland, and nobody wants anyone to have to travel to Northern Ireland, are still happy for every woman in a crisis pregnancy to leave our shores and go abroad for abortion care.  Nine women did that today, and three women took the abortion pill today.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right.  Inpatient charges are capped at &euro;800 a year.  I wanted to clarify that point as well.<\/p>  <p>  Even though we have debated it for a very long period of time, I do not believe this amendment achieves what it is endeavouring to achieve.  I pointed that out on Committee Stage in advance of Report Stage because the Deputy is trying to amend section 4, which is just a standard provision in the legislation.  If she wanted to achieve what she wants to achieve, she should be amending a different part of the Bill because this provision does not relate to funding for the expanded service for the termination of pregnancy.  As such, the amendment is inappropriate and would not achieve the aim Deputy Nolan is trying to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  Last July, the Government approved the provision of termination of pregnancy services in this country on the basis of universal access for persons who are ordinarily resident in the State.  That is the basis on which we are planning to introduce the services in 2019.  That is the basis on which this legislation is before the Oireachtas, and I see no reason whatsoever to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700051#YY00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1543355100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I find it sad and frustrating that one Deputy in particular came into this Chamber, made wild accusations and damaged my reputation by saying this was coming from a businessman.

It will reduce energy costs for householders and businesses, contribute to the State's requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and grow renewable energy, as well as reducing the level of imported fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill aims to grow small-scale renewable energy, which has a big part to play in our energy future.  Microgeneration allows for self-consumption to reduce energy bills, and the Bill allows for excess electricity to be exported back into the grid, which will add to the State's sources of renewable energy and, importantly, give extra income to households, businesses and farmers to pay for the costs of installation for microgeneration.  The State is far behind on its climate change obligations and we continue to play catch-up with our European neighbours.<\/p>  <p>  The world must triple its efforts or face catastrophic climate change, according to a United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions which was published today and which we all heard loud and clear.  The report also found we are extremely unlikely to keep the rise in global temperatures to below 2&deg; Celsius or possibly even 3&deg; Celsius, and warned of catastrophic risks ahead.  The report is yet another warning that highlights the global situation, as well as the failure of our State to deal with the issue.  In June, the Climate Action Network put Ireland second last in the European Union for combatting climate change.  Drastic and wholesale action is required.  The State is a laggard in regard to climate change, as even the Taoiseach admitted.<\/p>  <p>  Irish householders produces 60% more greenhouse gas emissions than the EU average because of our considerable reliance on oil for heating and fossil fuels, which are key factors.  We need to give householders alternatives through renewable energy.<\/p>  <p> As a State and as taxpayers, we face hundreds of millions of euro worth of fines in 2020 and beyond because we have not reduced our greenhouse gas emissions or grown our renewable energy portfolio sufficiently because of the inaction of the Government and its predecessors.  We must take seriously the vital requirement to broaden the sources of renewable energy on this island.  We will need to do this if we are to combat climate change and create security of energy supply.  We import almost &euro;5 billion worth of fossil fuels but this is not environmentally or economically sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Electricity will be a vital energy source because it will be used more for home heating through heat pumps for transport as the number of electric vehicles on the road grows.  We need to expand because we know that electric vehicles will be the only show in town in 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Irish households and businesses have the fourth highest electricity prices in the EU.  We also pay a carbon tax and a public service obligation levy, which supports large-scale renewable energy.  Nonetheless, energy prices continue to rise and the major electricity suppliers increased their prices in July and August.  It is time to allow ordinary people to reduce their household bills and to involve citizens, households and businesses in growing our renewable energy sources. <\/p>  <p>  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action visited the Tipperary Energy Agency and Cloughjordan today.  We saw the eco-village and visited projects such as the swimming pool in Nenagh town, a rural school outside Nenagh and a household in Nenagh.  We saw at first hand microgeneration and energy conservation at work.  We heard how a school halved its energy bills.  If the school could feed its excess electricity back to the grid at times when it is not being used it would benefit the school financially, as well as the State by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and producing more electricity from a renewable source.<\/p>  <p>  We do not propose anything earth-shattering.  We must remember that a pilot scheme once existed where a tariff was offered by Electric Ireland for microgeneration, and a scheme also existed in the North of Ireland.  Schemes exist across the EU.  In Germany, for example, payments have been made for decades, and 31% of renewable energy capacity is owned by individuals, with farmers owning 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of a feed-in tariff is a further sign of the lack of imagination from the Government and previous Governments in regard to renewable energy.  To date, our renewable energy has been almost completely based on large-scale onshore wind but it is not a good model and we know the reason is we did not involve communities.  If we are realistically to combat climate change and create security of energy supply on this island, it will be from a range of sources of energy, such as solar photovoltaic, PV, hydro, biogas, small-scale wind and many others.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must realise the significant potential in microgeneration.  A pilot scheme supporting solar PV has been established, which we admit is a start but crucially, it does not include a feed-in tariff.  There is also a push from Europe for microgeneration under the clean energy package.  This will establish a regulatory framework for household self-consumption under Article 20.<\/p>  <p>  We must recognise that the electricity grid of the near future will be different from what we have now, and the Government must see this change and be prepared.  The future will be very different, with households generating their own electricity to supply their homes and charge the batteries for their cars.  We will cut down on the 10% of electricity lost in transmission and we will directly involve people and communities in the production of energy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's White Paper in 2015 stated that we will be &ldquo;exploring the scope to provide market support for micro generation&rdquo;.  It also stated \"The energy system will change from one that is almost exclusively Government and utility led, to one where citizens and communities will increasingly be participants in energy efficiency and in renewable energy generation and distribution.\"<\/p>  <p>  The Citizens' Assembly also recommended that we have a feed-in tariff for microgeneration.  This Sinn F&eacute;in Bill has the support of Friends of the Earth, Stop Climate Chaos, An Taisce and Tr&oacute;caire.  It is also being considered by farming organisations and many others.  We saw the future at first hand today in Nenagh and Cloughjordan in Tipperary and we saw how the future will be across the country.  We must move it into the mainstream, however, and do across the whole country what those towns are doing.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot see why a Government which is committed to climate change, as the Government says it is and as I hope it is, and which is committed to addressing our energy security supply and to citizen involvement in renewable energy, would oppose the Bill.  I ask for a coalition tonight to support the Bill and push forward with it.  We need to involve citizens, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and reduce bills for households, businesses and farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700052#ZZ00500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1543355700,"counter":497,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis c&uacute;pla focail a r&aacute; ar an mBille seo agus caithfidh m&eacute; moladh m&oacute;r a thabhairt don Teachta Stanley f&aacute; choinne an mBille seo a thabhairt os comhair an T&iacute; anocht.

If enacted, it has the potential to reduce the energy bills for countless households across the State.  It is timely and important, and it will provide for direct payments to householders in return for excess electricity produced on site, which will be redirected to the national grid via the main supply.<\/p><p>Individual householders stand to benefit as well as the climate.  It is a win-win scenario for both where not only will this initiative incentivise property owners to embrace the plethora of renewable energy options available today, but microgeneration and the return of excess power to the wider grid will have several positive outcomes.  I hope, therefore, the House will agree and support the Bill and allow it to pass to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The practice will have the effect of broadening the State's renewable energy portfolio, thus further reducing our dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation.  Similarly, and this point should not be overlooked, the expansion of microgeneration and the export of surplus electricity to the network will ensure future needs are met and the State has a reliable supply in coming years.  Time and again, research shows that on-site microgeneration can dramatically balance the supply and demand for electric power because by producing more power during periods of high demand and less during periods of low demand, the hybridised grid allows for microgeneration systems and large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than could be otherwise achieved.  <\/p> <p> I regret that the State is failing to meet its climate change obligations and the position is unlikely to change without serious action.  This Bill can form part of that.  Irish households produce 60% more emissions than the European Union average.  This initiative will help to grow an alternative energy source, having the effect of lowering our carbon footprint and reducing costs for electricity consumers and householders whose disposable income is already tightly squeezed at the end of the week.<\/p> <p> I am pleased that the objectives set out in Deputy Stanley's Bill have received the backing of organisations such as Friends of the Earth, Stop Climate Chaos, An Taisce and Tr&oacute;caire, to name but a few.

Let us make a positive contribution to households, climate and energy policy, while reducing costs for people who are struggling with energy prices that are among the highest in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700052#ZZ00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543356300,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague Deputy Brian Stanley on introducing this Bill on microgeneration.  This is very welcome legislation, which would allow excess energy produced by small scale domestic microgenerators, such as photovoltaic panels or small wind turbines, to be fed into the national grid and provides that householders would be paid for it, which is currently not the case.  This type of system would be of great benefit to many of my constituents in Limerick who have asked me why this is not already provided for.  The change would incentivise people to install renewable energy sources, as they could use them for their own use.  It would be considerably cheaper for them in the long run and would allow people to use the excess electricity they generate as a source of income.  It would be excellent for society and the environment.  I am at a loss to understand how anyone would not support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for Opposition parties to bring forward legislation aimed at contributing to the fight against climate change because, unfortunately, the Government has no interest in the issue.  Ireland has already agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels.  Last week, I was genuinely shocked to read that Ireland is set to miss its 2020 emission targets by 95%.  Many people, especially younger citizens, are outraged by our lack of action in this area.  While I was aware that we were off target, it is shocking that we will miss them by such a margin.  Fine Gael can add climate change to the policy areas of health, housing, childcare, broadband and insurance costs in which it is utterly failing our people.  For the life of me, I cannot understand the thinking behind Government policy in this area.  Instead of investing heavily in renewables to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels and reduce our emissions, we are stockpiling money in case the banks need another bailout and hurtling towards 2020 when we will miss our target by a country mile and have to pay millions in fines to Europe every year, leaving even less money to invest in renewables.  This is utter madness.<\/p>  <p>  I commend again my colleague Deputy Stanley on bringing forward this important Bill.

It is about making the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy which must take place as a matter of urgency.  The legislation proposes to allow small-scale household production of electricity through solar or wind energy.  It provides that excess electricity produced by microgenerators, whether households or farms, may be fed into the grid and for households to be paid for it, which is currently not provided for.  <\/p>  <p>  This State is lagging far behind other countries on this issue.  Why are we not harnessing and utilising solar power from rooftops and small-scale wind and other sources?  The Bill aims to grow the renewable energy sector and add more renewable energy sources, thus enabling citizens to play their part in expanding the sector.  It is essential that households and communities are part of our switch to renewable energy.  They should not be used as a source of tax or a levy to support the switch from fossil fuels.  They must be allowed to become active participants.  The Government&rsquo;s solution to everything, whether in health, housing, infrastructure or climate change, is to throw a tax break at the issue and hope for the best.  This shows the complete lack of vision or ambition on the Government benches that the problems of the world can be sorted through the tax code rather than investment.  Its approach is not working in respect of the housing crisis and it will not work in the renewable sector.<\/p>  <p>  We must broaden the types of renewable energy we have, while also broadening ownership to allow for the involvement of citizens.  In Germany, 31.5% of renewable energy capacity is owned by private persons, of whom 10.5% are farmers.  The costs of renewable sources such as solar have declined dramatically in recent years, making it more feasible for a greater number of people to produce their own energy.  If we are to take climate change and job creation seriously, increase security of supply and allow ordinary householders to play their part, we must urgently use all available resources.  It is essential that the potential of home-generated electricity provided for in this legislation is advanced.  I appeal to the Government and all parties in the House to support the Bill.  The Taoiseach and others on the Government benches often accuse Sinn F&eacute;in of not bringing forward solutions.  Last week, we brought forward a solution on a planning matter that impacts on people in rural Ireland and in this Bill we are proposing a solution in the area of renewable energy that incentivises people to become involved in its production.  It is up to the Government to take these proposals on board and act on them.  <\/p>  <p>  We are trying to provide an environmental and economic solution to global warming.  The effects of climate change will most likely result in warmer summers and wetter winters, something that we saw today and will see again tomorrow.  Studies by Met &Eacute;ireann show that increases in world temperatures will mean more flooding in coastal areas and rivers, as people living in Dublin, Arklow, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway will testify.  We need to create a climate of change to halt global warming and this Bill, in a small way, will play its part in doing that.  It is a highly practical Bill that proposes a necessary approach to a problem that affects us all.  I commend its author and also commend the Government on supporting it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700053#AAA00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1543356300,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I will speak first because, under Standing Orders, the Minister may only speak once on Private Members' business.  I commend Deputy Stanley on introducing the Bill and thank Deputy Cullinane for thanking the Government for not opposing it.  The Government subscribes to the principles outlined in Deputy Stanley's contribution and we will not oppose them in legislation.  I welcome the opportunity that this debate gives to highlight the important role the citizen should play in Ireland's energy transition and community and citizen participation in renewable energy projects.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is supportive in principle of the ambition reflected in the Bill and the route to market it provides for citizens and communities to generate their own renewable energy and receive a fair and efficient price for doing so.  The Bill is very much in line with one of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's flagship projects, the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which places community's at the centre of its design.<\/p><p>It is also a key provision of the EU's clean energy package and, in particular, the recast renewable energy directive, which entitles renewable self-consumers, or microgenerators, to receive remuneration for excess electricity exported to the grid.<\/p> <p> The Government is not opposing the Bill but it will be necessary for the Government to develop its own legislative proposals to fully transpose the terms of the EU directive.  A number of policy measures are already under way or planned and signalled to the market that will ultimately provide for an appropriate microgeneration scheme domestically.  The Government is supportive in principle of the ambition contained within this Bill as it aligns with energy policy as set out in the energy White Paper 2015, the new renewable energy directive and the clean energy package.  The energy White Paper recognised the important role that the citizen should play in Ireland's energy transition.  Moreover, community and citizen participation in renewable electricity projects was identified as a key policy objective to be delivered via the new renewable electricity support scheme.<\/p> <p> The Government will need to assess the best way to implement any remuneration for excess electricity exported to the grid.  There are different methods of approaching this and we will need to consult with industry and other relevant stakeholders along the way.  The 2015 energy White Paper committed that Government would explore the scope to provide market support for microgeneration.  The Department duly assessed microgeneration of various technologies as part of the economic assessment to underpin the new renewable energy support scheme design, and the evidence generated indicates that the relative cost of microgeneration is very high.<\/p> <p> The Department continued to explore ways to support microgeneration and, last year, in conjunction with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, hosted a microgeneration stakeholder workshop which attracted over 100 attendees.  The workshop identified a number of structural, technical and financial challenges that need to be overcome before a support scheme for micro-renewable energy could be implemented.  This aligns with experience from other EU member states which have introduced schemes and have either had to reform them or close them down completely due to costs getting out of control.  The workshop identified a series of \"quick wins\" for microgeneration which could be achieved in advance of the implementation of the recast renewable energy directive and, in particular, Article 21, which deals with renewable self-consumers or microgenerators.  The workshop also heard calls for the establishment of an umbrella group for the microgeneration sector and, subsequently, the Micro Renewable Energy Federation was formed, which was a welcome development.<\/p> <p> Microgeneration is generally operated at the electricity system distribution level, and consumers who invest in such generation usually do not participate directly in the wholesale electricity market.  Consequently, some of the primary support mechanisms that require renewable electricity generators to directly participate in the wholesale market may not be suitable for microgeneration.  In most EU member states, no specific schemes to support microgeneration and self-consumption exist.  In fact, in a number of member states, distribution system operators do not even measure the volume of self-generated electricity.  Nevertheless, even in these countries, consumers may find they can save money by generating their own electricity from small-scale renewable electricity installations, for example, rooftop solar photovoltaic, PV, installations, rather than buying it from the grid.  Examples of this type of activity are happening across Ireland today without subsidy or payment.<\/p> <p> Following on from this, in summer 2018 a pilot scheme supporting microgeneration was launched and the Department, along with SEAI, which administers the scheme, has been working closely with the Micro Renewable Energy Federation to develop an industry code of practice which will ensure a sustainable microgeneration industry for years to come.  The design of the pilot scheme was informed by a behavioural and attitudes study undertaken by SEAI into the likely demand for and uptake of microgeneration among the public.  The pilot scheme will run up to the end of 2020.  It will be subject to a review early in 2019 which will examine scope for broadening it out to other technologies and other user groups.  The evidence gathered during the pilot scheme will also assist in the implementation of Article 21 of the recast renewable energy directive, which sets out the rights, entitlements and obligations of the renewable electricity self-consumer.<\/p> <p> The scheme focuses on the deployment of domestic solar PV, whereby applicants can receive a rebate for installing solar PV panels and-or a battery energy storage system in their home.  The main principle of the scheme is that the solar PV system installed should provide electricity for self-consumption within the home.  The scheme opened in July 2018, when applicants could register their interest with SEAI to install solar PV and battery storage systems.  The payments portal opened in October 2018.  By mid-November, over 3,000 people had expressed interest and approximately 100 rebate claims have been requested.  SEAI expects to begin making payments under this scheme early next month.  A code of practice for microgeneration is also being developed and, in conjunction with the industry umbrella group, the Micro Renewable Energy Federation, the building blocks for a sustainable microgeneration sector are being put in place in advance of the implementation of the clean energy package.<\/p> <p> Looking forward to future remuneration for microgeneration as part of implementation of the clean energy package requirements, a number of options will need to be considered, costed and subjected to regulatory impact assessment.  Based on the analysis carried out by the Department to date, these are likely to include a requirement for suppliers to pay microgenerators the wholesale market price for electricity exported to the grid.  Based on international experience in this area, it is of utmost importance that the distributional costs of such a scheme are assessed, particularly relating to network charges and any costs paid through the public service obligation.  Allocation of costs through consumers' electricity bills can have significant socioeconomic impacts, and this is particularly so at a time when energy prices are on the rise, with recent price increases announced by retail suppliers.<\/p> <p> If the policy is not assessed and designed properly, there is a real risk that providing incentives for those investing in microgeneration will lead to increased costs for households who cannot afford such investments.  International experience is instructive in this regard and suggests that reform of network tariffs needs to be delivered as part of a package of measures to make microgeneration work for the citizen and community, while also ensuring that ordinary consumers are not disadvantaged as a result.  In this regard, and as part of the implementation of the microgeneration requirements of the clean energy package, the Department will work with SEAI, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and suppliers to build on the work done by the Deputy in bringing forward this Bill.<\/p> <p> Some elements of the proposed Bill will require careful scrutiny and likely amendment.  It does not provide information on potential costs to the Exchequer or electricity consumers from the proposed introduction of a tariff for microgeneration.  Moreover, the Bill does not include any evidence to indicate what level the proposed tariff should be set at or the overall cost to consumers and the economy of a 5% requirement on suppliers for electricity from microgeneration by 2025.  This Bill will, therefore, ultimately require financial and regulatory impact assessment.  For these reasons, the Government recommends that the Bill would undergo detailed scrutiny by the Oireachtas to discover the full cost of the proposals in advance and allow Government determine whether a money message is required.  The Minister intends to revert to Government in due course as this legislation proceeds through the Oireachtas.  In recognising the ambitions behind the drafting of the Bill, the Government will not oppose its current progress and is likely to develop further legislative proposals in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700053#AAA00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543356900,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Aindrias Moynihan, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Eugene Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700054#BBB00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1543356900,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, for his remarks.  It is the first time I have debated with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, since he took up his new role and I take the opportunity to wish him well.  I highlight that we had a social media Bill before the relevant committee this afternoon and there is a broadband Bill in the system as well.  I look forward to debating with the Minister and to constructive engagement during his time in the role.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Bill.  It is a critical and common-sense Bill that has many evident benefits.  I have met many companies in the sector and I have met representatives of the Irish Solar Energy Association who have articulated the many obvious benefits of solar energy.  It is inspiring to see smaller companies in particular entering that space.  The industry in Ireland has the potential to deliver up to 5 GW of capacity between 2019 and 2030.  To put this in context, this is the kind of energy the entire west coast could produce using offshore renewable wind in the same period, so there is a great opportunity in this regard.  However, while these companies and others in the same space are ready and waiting to lead the charge in driving up the production of green energy in Ireland, they need our help.<\/p><p>In the main, the issues raised are not barriers which they themselves have created.  They are barriers which have come about as a result of the failure of the legislative system to accommodate technological developments.  The renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, was a start, but we need to go further.  We need to act to facilitate microgeneration through the opening of the grid; the introduction of feed-in tariffs and support for community organisations, as well as households to take part.  It seems to be perfectly reasonable and good public policy that a parish hall could avail of these benefits in the same way as a private household.  Grid connection rules should be altered to make it easier for microenergy and community energy projects to gain access to the grid.  It should also include reforms to make it easier for large-scale consumers such as hotels and airports to generate their own electricity.  Part of energy security is energy supply.  We know that transmission is a huge factor.  There is no substitute for a robust, integrated, well managed grid.  EirGrid manages it well but the Celtic interconnector and the Ireland-UK interconnector will come under pressure post Brexit.  <\/p> <p> Self-production is not a quick fix, but it would certainly be of assistance.  It begins at home.  We need to increase the availability of space in the literal, real estate sense, with the greater use of solar energy on rooftops.  The planning process, particularly in situations where a panel may not be visible from the ground, needs to be reviewed.  There is a significant opportunity to increase the number of businesses and community facilities which can host panels.  Consideration is needed at a high level of the barriers and solutions required in the use of private wires.  How do we manage the planning framework and the practicalities in running a cable across another person's land?  A systematic review is needed of State-generated costs in the deployment of solar energy.  With only 12 years to act, the State should not be acting as a barrier to entry.  <\/p> <p> We must learn the lessons from onshore wind projects when engaging with communities.  There are huge benefits in the use of all kinds of renewable energy resources, including onshore wind, but that sector, in particular, highlighted the wrong way to do it, with a lack of engagement and, at times, truculent and adversarial engagement with local communities in the case of many onshore wind energy project developers.  That is certainly not the road to go down.  <\/p> <p> The bottom line is that renewable energy resources development cannot happen without community support.  This needs to be reflected in the approach of developers, wind and solar energy project developers, with a stronger emphasis on community benefit, engagement and consultation.  Up until now, investment in a local amenity has been the mainstay of community benefit schemes.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes this system should be changed such that all individual households in the area surrounding an energy development would benefit from its construction.  These issues must be addressed as we are failing to meet our targets.  Worse than that, we are failing to facilitate those who would help us to meet them.  When I put a question to the Taoiseach last year on the Order of Business about what provision the Government was making for fines that would inevitably accrue from failing to meet our targets at European level, he somewhat glibly replied that he would not make provision in this year's Finance Bill because it was a matter to be dealt with in the following year's Finance Bill.  More substantive engagement is required.  <\/p> <p> The world is 1&deg; Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels.  Levels of CO2 are almost 50% higher than before the Industrial Revolution.  Levels of methane are now 2.5 times higher than in pre-industrial times.  The last time the Earth had a similar level of CO2 was 3.5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2&deg; Celsius to 3&deg; Celsius warmer and sea level was 10 m to 20 m higher than it is now.  In the past year we have seen 100-year weather extremes.  What was once a one in 100 years flood has become a once in a decade flood or once in a year flood, as my colleague Deputy Eugene Murphy knows well.  In October last year there was Storm Ophelia; we had Storm Emma in March when we also had snow drifts the likes of which had not been seen in generations.  We also had the wettest spring and the hottest period in the summer in 100 years.  For any climate change deniers, the proof has been in the elements during the past 12 months alone.  <\/p> <p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has published the most chilling warning yet.  Political leaders must act now if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 2010 levels within 12 years.  It will be a difficult target to reach, particularly given that we are already behind.  Even if we do reach it, we will only limit global warming to 1.5&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  We have reached the point of no return and are now dangling our toes over the side of the abyss.  Despite this, it has taken a Bill brought forward by an Opposition deputy to prompt the Government to act.  I note that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has said he is committed to ensuring Ireland will be a leader on climate change.  I wish him well in that regard.  He may wish to start by addressing the backlog of inaction in his Department.<\/p> <p> The proposal put forward by Deputy Stanley is not controversial.  It is a good common-sense proposal.  A total of 99% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly supported the introduction of legislation to support microgeneration.  Electric Ireland ended its feed-in tariff regime for new customers in 2014.  In the four years since, no significant legislative action has been taken to address this obvious issue.  I was startled when, shortly after being elected in 2016, a constituent approached me to tell me about his house on the Kildare-Wicklow border on which he had installed solar panels at great expanse.  He was very keen and enthusiastic about them, but, figuratively speaking, the rug had been pulled from under him when the tariff scheme ended abruptly in 2014.  I was shocked because I could not see any significant solid reason from a public policy point of view why it should have been ended, rather than enhancing a scheme of that nature.  <\/p> <p> The Government should consider this as an opportunity to address the issue and speed up the development of microgeneration.  We have a couple of technical concerns with the Bill which we will save for Committee Stage.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith introduced a Bill on the expiry of fossil fuels.  It is related to this Bill because we know that we are in a climate emergency, but there are some advocates within and outside the House who believe such measures as keeping the ground Bill, as it is referred to colloquially, should not be advanced.  While there may be some legitimate concerns within the industry, I suggest aggressive adversarial approaches would be counter-productive.  That Bill seeks to prohibit the granting of future licences.  However, the typical lifetime of a well, from discovery to close-down, is approximately 50 years.  If a licence was to be granted tomorrow, the last barrel of oil would be taken from the ground in 2068.  Even if the Bill was to be passed, that would not exactly be an immediate shutdown.  The industry should take note and some appropriate actions.  <\/p> <p> I look forward to engaging on the Bill when it proceeds to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700054#BBB00400","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543357500,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Climate change is perhaps the biggest issue facing us and we must recognise the huge moral obligation we all have to take immediate action to minimise future warming and adapt to climatic changes that have already been set in motion by historic levels of emissions of greenhouse gases.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017.  Energy production should not be just for the big elite and the big windfarm and the big power generators.  It has an important role to play in ensuring active community participation in meeting our climate change targets.  There is a strong will among the public, as we saw when 99% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly supported the introduction of legislation to support microgeneration.<\/p>  <p>  A Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government introduced the first scheme to support microgeneration in 2008.  To some extent, it set things in motion, but it is disappointing that the structures needed to promote energy citizenship further have seen so little progress since.  I acknowledge the pilot scheme introduced in early July.  It is a helpful step and it will be important to review it at the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of technical issues with the Bill which we can tease out on Committee Stage.  I am assuming it will progress to that Stage.  The scale of microgeneration is currently undefined.  Community projects have also not been defined to the level required.  The Bill defines community projects in terms of the number of households only.  Fianna F&aacute;il favours an approach which would see opportunities to have a much more ambitious definition of community.  We could develop microgeneration across organisations such as community centres, schools and sports clubs if a broader approach was taken.  If successful, it could be used to reduce overheads for community organisations and potentially even generate revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is at its best at community level.  With a payment for microgeneration, communities could develop their own local power plants, from the roof of the local school, community hail and farm shed and become active participants in the energy transformation we so desperately need.  Further measures are also required to facilitate microgeneration.  They include a systematic review of State-generated costs in the deployment of renewable energy projects, including planning permission, consideration of issues surrounding the use of private wires and further reforms to make it easier for large-scale consumers such as hotels and airports to generate their own electricity.<\/p><p>Ta dushl&aacute;n m&oacute;r romhainn maidir le hathr&uacute; aer&aacute;ide agus caithfimid dul i ngleic leis seo gan mhoill.

I agree completely that microgeneration has a significant role to play, not only in reducing individuals' costs, but in providing electricity to the grid.  I had the idea a number of years ago of seeing to what extent I could become self-sustaining in energy terms in my own house.  We put in solar panels which have worked extremely well in providing hot water.  One group that has benefitted greatly from that technology is the group of people who keep students in the Gaeltacht in the summer as they need lots of hot water then.  Of course, one gets a great deal more sunlight in the summer than in winter and it proves to be a very efficient way to reduce one's heating bills.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been anxious to take further steps to reduce the electricity usage in my home, not only by improving its insulation but by generating power.  We have spoken a great deal here about photovoltaic generation, or solar panels, but I had the idea of getting a domestic wind turbine as I am on a hill with plenty of space around me and no neighbours to complain.  However, the one inhibitor of this plan was that I could not sell the surplus production to the grid.  Everyone gives out about poor rural people and all of the fossil fuels we burn in our motor vehicles.  My next plan was to charge a car at night from the winds passing over the area in which I live thereby reducing my personal fossil fuel usage.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that if a lot of people each do a little, it will have a major impact.  I am very disappointed, therefore, with a lot of what I heard from the Minister tonight.  We are eight or nine years along from the point at which the ESB started to pay a small amount for microgeneration, but all we have been given tonight is a list of barriers, rules and regulations, including EU rules, as to why we can never get beyond dreaming and take action.  In previous generations, there was a much greater capacity to get things done, learn from mistakes and keep going forward.  Nowadays, it seems to take about 20 years of going around a thing before we make it happen.  It is only when there is a crisis that we realise the thing could have been done all along.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Minister and the Department to put behind them these eight years of nothing that the Government has had and give a firm commitment to introduce microgeneration on a basis that is attractive to ordinary people.  A lot of people do not want to make money or even massive savings.  They want to make a contribution and if they break even or make a small saving, they are more than happy to make the investment.  This suits everybody, be they urban or rural.  However, as a lot of rural houses are built with south-facing aspects and are surrounded by a great deal more space, rural dwellers have many more microgeneration options.  This is something that could greatly reduce the rural footprint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700056#DDD00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1543358100,"counter":510,"content":"<p>In 2008, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government introduced the first scheme to support microgeneration, but virtually nothing has happened in the ten years since.

I have no doubt that if microgeneration had been expanded and worked on over the decade, there would have been very significant input from the Irish public.  I see correspondence coming in via email from across my constituency which demonstrates the massive level of interest in renewable energy and climate change.

The lack of response on that issue and the constant delay in bringing legislation forward to put the guidelines on a proper footing is damaging renewable area as a sector.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's 2020 renewable energy targets include increasing the share of final energy consumption from renewable energy sources to 16% as set out in the renewable energy directive.  The target is broken into three key sectors with individual 2020 targets for each.  As such, Ireland has committed to meet this national target through 40% renewable electricity, 12% renewable heat and 10% renewable transport.  The overall renewable energy target and the renewable transport target are both binding at EU level.  Ireland is likely to fall very far short of the binding target.  People like Paul Deane of UCC reckon we will have huge fines to pay, perhaps of the order of &euro;300 million.  The Government estimates the level of fines at &euro;100 million.  Another expert, Mr. Joseph Curtin, says we could face bills and penalties of between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million.  If we had developed this from 2008, we would not be facing what we are in 2020.  That is a highly regrettable matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to support the Bill.  It is a good step forward.  I hope the Government will move with the Opposition parties to make this a top priority and ensure it happens as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700056#DDD00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1543358100,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice is substituting for the Labour Party Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700056#DDD00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543358100,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and thank Deputy Alan Kelly for accommodating me.  I commend Deputy Stanley on bringing forward the Bill, which I intend to support.  There is a great deal that could be achieved nationally through small-scale microgeneration.  If the Minister went to Germany, he would see that many farms generate their own electricity.  There is a facility there whereby those farmers can sell their electricity to the grid.  While some small turbines are made in Athenry and there is a pig farm in Kildare which is generating electricity, the big problem in Ireland involves the stumbling blocks that are put in front of microgeneration.  There seems to be an attitude in this country that bigger is better.<\/p><p>Big investors will get everything thrown at them but the small ordinary person does not get any incentive or does not even get a chance to get in on the game.<\/p> <p> If we look at the likes of Germany, in all of the farms, regardless of whether there are cattle in a shed, they are able to take the gas out of it and use it for generation.  I was across the Border near Banbridge and I looked at a digester that was using all grass and it was working very successfully.  Farmers were doing that in their local area.<\/p> <p>An argument is put up by the electricity companies to say they cannot judge what people will bring in or produce.  To be honest, it often cannot be judged what wind generation is bringing in.  It is not that there will be a major amount of generation happening when people will be using it themselves in the first instance.  I do not buy the argument of talking about what we have signed up to for 2020, but the reality is that we lost 240,000 young people from this country and thankfully we have over 2 million people back working again, so we probably signed up to stuff because we did not know where we would be in ten or 15 years' time.  A lot of information is going around about what people will and will not be paying but this should not be about that.  This should be about giving incentives to people, especially in rural areas, who could help generate electricity and also help to give them money.  Solar panels have helped to give houses hot water in parts of the country where they were put up.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out, that helps in places such as the Gaeltacht where there are students.  In general they have been pretty good but not enough of them can go on a roof to provide for a house's electricity.<\/p> <p> There will be unanimous support for this around the House.  We need to make sure that we do not always talk about the problems and the reasons we cannot do something.  We need to look at how we can do something.  This Bill needs to be supported.  I attended a meeting last night with communities who are seriously worried about these monstrous turbines, the guidelines and the setback distances around them because people do not want big monstrous structures around them.<\/p> <p> In looking at the microgeneration that is happening around the country with people who are probably before their time in going out and investing in it themselves, they are trying to move things forward but unfortunately, they are not getting the supports at Government level that would be given if they were foreign investors or something similar.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister to support this Bill and let it proceed to Committee Stage.  I acknowledge that different electrical crowds came before the committee and they seem to be putting a little block in place but anything can be surpassed with pressure and with governmental pressure especially, that can be resolved.  People right around this country can contribute an awful lot.  I support the Bill and once again I commend Deputy Stanley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700056#DDD00500","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543358700,"counter":514,"content":"<p>People Before Profit fully supports this proposed microgeneration Bill and I commend Deputy Stanley on bringing it forward.<\/p>  <p>  It seems to me that the Minister would be fully supporting this Bill, as would any Government that understood and really got what climate change actually means.  The dangers of catastrophic climate change are a priority issue that is facing us and while the Minister would say that, what he does does not prove it because it means we must urgently look at how we consume and produce energy and take all of the steps needed for a massive switch to renewables, while reducing our consumption.  Democratising the energy grid is a vital step in this process, which would allow us to actively engage households and communities in making the switch to renewables on the scale and in the timeframe that is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Recent reports, particularly the one from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, have utterly changed the narrative on this issue.  The IPCC stated &ldquo;Limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.&rdquo;  The Minister's attitude to this Bill is none of the above.  Those changes will mean leaving 80% of proven reserves of fossil fuels in the ground and cutting our emissions by 10% annually until we get down to negative emissions.  Does the Minister accept that this is necessary?<\/p>  <p>  The changes the IPCC talks about are proposed to avoid extremely dangerous, as opposed to dangerous, climate change, that is, the difference between a global temperature increase of 1.5&deg; Celsius or of 2&deg; Celsius.  We should be clear that both of those overheating measurements mean a death sentence that will hang over large parts of humanity and of the world's biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  The difference is whether we want to condemn large parts of humanity and the earth's life to a climate and planet which is not conducive to habitable life.  A lack of action means we are effectively saying we cannot reduce CO2 emissions, so we accept that the future is one of extreme and deadly heatwaves, longer drought periods, failing crop harvests and rising sea levels.<\/p>  <p>  One would think that given this possibility and given what scientists say to us, that all of our resources, all of our ingenuity and all of our creativity would be marshalled into doing what is required; that is, reducing and eliminating our use of fossil fuels.  One would think that any Government which understood that and which understood what is at stake would be moving heaven and earth to get us off oil, coal and gas in all areas and utilising all available renewable energy.  In fact, the Government has displayed breathtaking ignorance and disregard for these realities.<\/p>  <p>  As was previously mentioned, the Government is opposing my Bill to ban exploration for fossil fuels to prevent their use and I understand the Government is now stalling on Deputy Stanley&rsquo;s Bill.  Just as it stalled on Deputy Joan Collins' Bill on the water referendum, it has kicked to touch on anything progressive that is coming from the Opposition such as Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill on banded hours, a Bill on protecting defined benefit pensions, our Bill on sex education or the Bill on medicinal cannabis.  The opposing of my Bill to ban exploration for fossil fuels that we cannot use shows breathtaking ignorance.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to pursue an agricultural policy that is unsustainable and will massively increase our national emissions and it continues to pursue policies in public transport and housing and development that ignore the reality of the scientific facts of climate change.  What we get is spin and the speech that the Minister just gave is absolute spin and he is very good at it.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key challenges we face is mobilising popular support for the measures that must be taken to avoid catastrophic climate change.  Some people feel despair at the fact that there can be widespread opposition to large scale wind farms around the country.  They call it NIMBYism but I understand that opposition and I argue that it is not just NIMBYism.  There are legitimate reasons and if we want to win people to forms of renewable energy, then we must seek the involvement of the communities and local people in any project.<\/p>  <p>  Telling people that they must accept massive wind farms put up by faceless multinationals, interested only in profit, is really not good enough and telling them also that we must have a carbon tax, is really not good enough.  We will lose the battle against fossil fuel corporations and vested interests if all we have to offer is a vision of the future with carbon taxes for ordinary people and large windmill farms making profits for major international private companies.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth remembering that carbon tax comes from the same ideological source as carbon trading, offsets and the clean development mechanism, which are market mechanisms that have all failed to reduce carbon emissions.  Relying on similar ideas from the same neoliberal school will also fail.<\/p>  <p>  We need much more radical action.  One step is to seek to democratise the energy grid as is proposed in this Bill.  The aim of this Bill is similar to one of the measures I proposed in 2016 when I proposed an amendment to the Energy Bill 2016 that sought to give access to the national grid for small-scale producers of renewable energy, but which was opposed by the Government.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I was told at the time by the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, that it was been considered and that it was complicated but that some measure would be taken.  Two years later we have got the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPPC, but no action has been taken by the Government.  <\/p> <p> The fight against climate change needs more than carbon taxes or large windfarms as a solution.  Support for microgeneration of renewable projects at local and community level is one way to get people involved and to effectively democratise the energy system.  It is a first small simple step we could take to signal that we are serious about climate change.<\/p> <p> We must first reduce the demand for energy and for fossil fuels.  Households and local communities that can provide for their own energy demands via renewable sources could make a huge impact on the steps we need to take.  Going further and allowing those people to supply electricity back to the grid would also make a huge difference in the years ahead in reducing the demand for energy.<\/p> <p> I hear many of the objections and it strikes me as amazing that, given what is at stake, there are question marks over this Bill that reference what the market will or will not take when it comes to making a proposal such as this one.  We have heard that the Government may use the requirement of a money message against the progress of Deputy Stanley's Bill.  It is as if tackling climate change was an optional extra or possibly just one extra policy decision the Government may or may not make.  <\/p> <p> This Bill needs to be supported.  If the Minister's recent rhetoric on climate change, which we heard, and if the recent press releases about all of government approaches and large climate action funds mean anything, he will support this Bill.  However, I suspect that the spin and promises are just an attempt to mask the gross and negligent failure of the Government's policy and the failure of the Minister responsible for this area, who has been known in the House as the Minister for climate inaction.  In doing so, the reality of the Government would be exposed and clearly, as a country, in order to tackle climate change in any serious way we would have to get rid of this Government in the first instance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700057#EEE00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543359300,"counter":516,"content":"<p>This Bill is a no brainer.  I certainly will support it and I thank Deputy Stanley for bringing it forward.  It will enable households, small businesses and farmers to receive payments for electricity generation from renewable energy sources.  This Private Member's Bill would force energy providers, notably the ESB, to buy electricity produced by microgenerators, including small communities, clubs and schools.  It appears there is all-party support for this Bill but we must question the Government's approach to some of these very progressive Bills that have been introduced in that, while it supports them, it has many questions about them.  I would like the Minister to say he supports the Bill, that he will bring it through Committee Stage working with Deputy Stanley and that he will do everything in his power to have it brought into law as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>This Bill would oblige suppliers to provide a feed-in tariff to those who supply the electricity grid.  Such a tariff is a mechanism where there is a minimum price established for the electricity produced and sold to a supplier.  It is usually to incentivise renewable energy production from wind or solar power.  Energy providers such as the ESB would have to establish a scheme to allow people sell their excess electricity.  There was a scheme in place which was closed in 2014.  We are nearly four years behind having in place for use a progressive renewable energy scheme.  There also would be an obligation on suppliers to provide at least 5% of their electricity from microgeneration.  The scheme would reduce Ireland's reliance on fossil fuels, something which this country quickly need to do to meet EU targets, to avoid hefty fines and to make a positive input into dealing with climate change.  Such schemes are the norm in other countries, particularly in northern Europe.  Approximately half of renewable energy in Germany comes form microgeneration schemes.<\/p><p>We received many e-mails on this issue, which shows the great interest people have in this issue.  I thank everyone who sent an email supporting this Bill.<\/p><p>  It was pointed out in one email that 99% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly, in terms of climate change, recommended that the State should enable, through legislation, the selling back to the grid of electricity from microgeneration by citizens through energy from solar panels or wind turbines on people's homes or land at a price which is at least equivalent to the wholesale price.  The White Paper on energy states that citizens and communities should play a central role yet, in practice, citizens cannot participate in a system of energy generation at any scale.  The point was made in this email that it is not fair that small scale generators must fill their excess power to the grid and get nothing for it.  It points out that we need a system that supports renewable energy at all levels, not just for the big guys.It further states that Ireland is at its best at community level.  It also states that with a payment for microgeneration, Irish communities could develop their own local power plants from the roof of the local school, community hall or farm shed and become active participants in the energy transformation so desperately needed.<\/p><p>  There is a real need for this Government, as the IPCC report states, to put action on their words and make a difference in respect of climate change.  The point was made earlier about being afraid to tackle big business.  A recent report indicated that only 100 companies are the source of more than 70% of emissions.  They include companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, BHP Billiton and Gazprom, which are all linked to that 71% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p>  Big companies need to be tackled because they are the source of the problem.  People can do something in small ways at ground level not to impact their carbon footprint in our world but these are the companies that generate most of the problems.  They have to be challenged, but I do not believe this Government is prepared to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700058#FFF00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1543359300,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I, too, support the Bill and I am happy to make some brief comments on it.

My colleague beside me might have a different idea but that is fine.  We are free thinkers in this group and we can do what we want.  We have no Whips, thank God.<\/p><p>  Projects such as those geared towards microregeneration also have a distinct advantage in terms of embedding climate change solutions at local level.  That is very important.  I am aware that Electric Ireland is extending its microgeneration pilot scheme export payment rate of 9 cent per kWh to existing domestic customers until 31 December 2018.  That is to be welcomed.  I would like to see the scheme extended beyond that point to allow for greater levels of involvement.  Currently, the scheme is too small and is not known outside those with a specific interest.  There is not enough awareness of it.  I do not know where the fault lies for that.<\/p><p>I note also that while ESB Networks will still accept new applications to connect microgenerators to the existing network, it no longer offers its microgeneration support package of free installation of an import-export meter.  That is an area that also must be addressed as a means of encouraging greater participation.<\/p><p>  In July this year, the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, launched a new microgeneration scheme to support domestic customers who install solar PV panels on their homes.  That pilot scheme will also support the installation of solar PV panels for the generation of self-consumption of renewable electricity.  As I understand it, the systems will be grant aided and additional grants will be available to those who install battery storage to capture electricity generated and used at a later date.  That is very important.  In light of that and the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, I am happy to give the Bill very favourable consideration.<\/p><p>  We will have to make it easier for more people to access the grid, as currently access to it for different types of electricity generation is nearly impossible.

Energy providers will be obliged to buy the electricity produced by residential homes and small businesses under the proposed initiatives.  The incentives for renewable energy production will mean that suppliers will have to provide a feeding tariff to microgenerators who supply to the electricity grid.

From the GAA to Tidy Towns to meals on wheels, Ireland's strength lies in our community spirit and activism.  The Green Party has always believed that Ireland can be a leader on renewable energy by allowing communities themselves to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy, not just large private companies.  We have long championed a payment for community microgeneration and introduced a pilot payment scheme in 2009 which the next Government regrettably removed in 2014.  We welcome this Bill as it is in line with recommendations made in our submission to the public consultation on the new renewable electricity support scheme and our own Community Energy (Co-ownership) Bill 2017.  Our Bill lays out guidelines for a community co-operative investment model to accompany the mandatory offer of shares to local people.  The Green Party's community co-ownership model is based on a successful Danish scheme which has resulted in greater community engagement in the transition to a renewable economy in Denmark.  Since 2009, the Danish renewable energy act requires all new wind projects to be at least 20% owned by local people.  We have also introduced on First Stage in the D&aacute;il the Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill to oversee the implementation of the EU's new governance of the energy union package and Ireland's national energy and climate plan, ensuring that climate action is taken in a manner that is just and fair to workers, local communities and farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Renewable energy is the only way forward for our climate, planet and future.  It is essential that as we move towards a greener economy, the transition is fair and community-led.  This Bill will enable households, small businesses and farmers to receive payments from electricity generated from renewable energy sources.  The Bill has the support of Friends of the Earth, Stop Climate Chaos, An Taisce and Tr&oacute;caire.  We need to ensure that any payment is provided in a fair and just manner.  The Green Party will therefore make amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that the Bill does not encourage the wealthiest to go off grid while leaving the poorest reliant on ever-increasing energy prices produced by fossil fuel-heavy utilities.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is at its best at the community level.  With the payment for microgeneration, Irish communities could develop their own local power plants, from the roof of the local school, community hall or farm shed, and become active participants in the energy transformation we so desperately need.  Energy should be viewed as a public good and a service to society, not a mere commodity.  Ireland has the fourth highest electricity prices in the EU and, during the summer, the electricity suppliers again raised their prices.  Irish citizens are treated as economic resources to extract from, but we should be democratic owners and participants in the great renewable energy transition.  We must also recognise that reducing our energy use is where the largest amount of success can be had on climate action, providing high-quality jobs and reducing energy poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to take real climate action to protect citizens from unnecessary deaths from cold and bad housing; to transfer State bodies such as Bord na M&oacute;na from exploiting peat to long-term, high-quality jobs in providing high-quality, warm and nearly zero energy homes; to launch a long-term plan to retrofit housing across the State, taking leadership and creating a positive market in the process; and to empower local communities to be integral parts of a just transition to a new green economy.

Bearing this reality in mind, I cannot see any downsides whatever arising from what the Bill is trying to achieve.  It is good for the environment and for people's financial circumstances.  Moreover, it empowers people to make a responsible personal decision to contribute to tackling the very real issue that is climate change today.<\/p>  <p>  If we are serious about reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and embracing environmentally friendlier energy sources, we need to support progressive green measures, of which this is certainly one.  There was much talk in the House last week about a carbon tax and the support levels of various parties for such.  A carbon tax is punitive unless it can change behaviour and unless there is an alternative.  Microgeneration is the alternative.  People can be encouraged from a financial and responsibility point of view.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a community aspect to this proposal.  Throughout the country, schools, community centres and sports clubs survive through members' fundraising efforts.  This measure has the capacity to provide a stable income stream for these community-based entities and should be promoted to them in the most favourable terms.  I enthusiastically endorse Deputy Stanley's Bill and what it seeks to achieve and I welcome the Government's acceptance of it.  What is needed now is a speedy passage towards its full implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700060#HHH00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543360500,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Stanley, on tabling the Bill.

I commend my colleague, Deputy Stanley, on not just talking about the challenges we face when it comes to our over-reliance on fossil fuels and the need for renewable alternatives but on bringing forward concrete, workable solutions.<\/p>  <p>  This Government and previous Governments have failed to grapple with the scourge of fuel poverty.  In 2007, a policy paper examining fuel poverty published by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland argued that levels of fuel poverty here were unacceptably high.  More than a decade later, they remain unacceptably high and, without doubt, much higher than they were in 2007.  Despite this, there has been no Government action to tackle fuel poverty during that period.<\/p>  <p>  The failure of Governments has left us in the position that 400,000 households are experiencing fuel poverty.  Lone parents are unable to afford to turn on their heating and older people wear their coats indoors and go to bed early just to stay warm.  We have all been contacted by people who sit in public libraries and other public buildings to avail of their heating systems and try to stay warm.  This is the reality of fuel poverty and ending it needs to be a Government priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill offers a solution in part to these households and some of the most vulnerable citizens struggling to pay their fuel bills.  Instead of continuing the vicious circle of rising fuel costs, leading to increased pressure on households to manage their bills and debt and disconnections, we can step up and assist these households to help themselves and find a long-term solution to supplying their own energy supply.  At the same time, it will put money back in their pockets when additional energy is sold to the grid.  It would also go some way towards helping us meet our target to cut carbon emissions by 2020.  It is unbelievable that we will miss our 2020 target by a staggering 95% and that this will result in annual fines to the State of up to &euro;600 million.<\/p><p>Those fines should be put into not only investing in renewable energy but also tackling the serious issue of fuel poverty in the State.  This Bill will achieve all of that.  It will play a crucial role in ending fuel poverty, something the Government has consistently failed to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700060#HHH00400","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543361100,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who participated in the debate.  I particularly thank Deputy Stanley for bringing this Bill forward.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, said, the Government will not oppose the Bill.  Indeed, we need a legal framework for microgeneration and we must promote its expansion.  It is undoubtedly an important opportunity for people to participate in reducing their reliance on bought-in energy, and it promotes a culture of reliance on renewable energy, which is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has imposed an obligation on Ireland to achieve 32% use of renewables across the entire energy system by 2020.  We will achieve a 40% target in respect of power but we will not achieve the target in other areas such as transport.  We will fall short in those areas so we must improve in them.  As many Deputies have indicated, we are facing a crisis in that we are way off target in respect of the carbon commitments we have made.  Quite apart from the fact that we have made legally binding commitments, the approach we take is a huge responsibility for the country and community.  We have had to focus urgently on the expansion of renewable energy, and the renewal energy support scheme is the vehicle for that.  We have an ambition to go from 40% renewable to 55% renewable by 2030.  That will represent a substantial expansion in our renewable capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of examining that target, microgeneration was seriously examined by the Department to see if it could make a contribution and whether it could be part of the scheme.  However, it did not have the capacity to deliver quickly on a large scale to meet the target we have in mind.  It is more expensive and would be much slower to achieve.  Instead of seeking to make it part of the broad renewable support scheme, where it would be competing with large wind and solar farms, the Department has introduced a special scheme for microgeneration.  It represents significant subsidies for microgeneration.  A solar PV gets &euro;700 per kilowatt it puts in.  Solar plus battery is larger scale and can draw down more subsidy.  A battery energy system gets &euro;1,000 per kilowatt.  Significant support is being provided for microgeneration.  In addition, there is significant interest based on the figures we have seen to date.  Approximately 5,000 applicants per annum will come into the scheme and it will run until 2020.  We will review the scheme early next year to examine the possibility of expanding it to other technologies or to other groups of people.  As a number of Deputies said, that would be worthwhile.  The scheme could be very successful and make a significant contribution to getting people to engage on this.<\/p>  <p>  Microgeneration is a good micro business because in some cases it can be 100% effective where there is a battery for storage.  It can pay for itself in approximately eight years.  Even without support it has a good payback period.  It also offers the opportunity to sell back into the grid.  Under EU commitments we must deliver a legal framework under which microgenerators can sell back to the grid.  I fully support that objective.  It was adopted by the Citizens' Assembly and by Deputy Stanley in his Bill.  The issue is the best mechanism to deliver it.  Different models have been used in different markets.  Some use what is called a net market price whereby when a person needs electricity, he or she buys it, and when that person has a surplus, he or she sells it and pays on the net flow.  That is one way of doing it in a number of countries.  Others do it by way of having a market price, as the Citizens' Assembly suggests.  A price is set as the wholesale price.  We must tease out which is the best option to choose.<\/p>  <p>  One of my misgivings with the Bill is that Deputy Stanley has not looked at what the costs will be and on whom they will fall.  With any legislation we must consider what would technically be called a regulatory impact assessment: who is being asked to carry the obligation, what it will cost and if it is the least costly way of achieving it.  We must work through that by consultation with those who will be involved and by looking at the pilot scheme to see what lessons can be learned from it and what lessons can be learned from other countries.  The Deputy has referred to other countries we should look at in considering how we should roll this out.<\/p>  <p>  Some misgivings must be also be expressed about the fact that the Deputy has chosen to provide for a minimum supply of 5% for some electricity suppliers but not others.  That 5% appears quite high and the Deputy is making it a legal obligation to have that much microgeneration within a very short time.  As to whether that is a realistic or deliverable target, while I am just a month in this job, from what I have learned it does not appear that microgeneration can hit such a target.  We will deliver 15% extra renewables by 2030 through a significant scheme which will require some level of support.  I doubt that microgeneration could deliver the target the Deputy outlines, so it would potentially be a very big obligation if it became law and was enforceable.  It would be a difficult and high-cost way of achieving what we all seek.  There are questions in that regard which have to be teased out.<\/p>  <p>  One aspect of what the Deputy is proposing that I like, and other speakers have spoken about this, is the importance of getting community commitment and partnership in the efforts to develop renewable energy.  We will not succeed in confronting the climate challenge if we cannot get community commitment.  Some of these things will be very unpopular.  We have spoken in the House about the need for a trajectory for carbon price.  Carbon is what economists call a negative externality.  We are doing damage to our environment and we are not paying for it.  That is why a carbon price will have to be considered as part of this.  It cannot all be Government schemes for subsidising people.  There will also be difficult decisions.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, we will have to change our lifestyles.  It is a big change and will not be easy to do, so it is important to have a sense of community partnership.<\/p>  <p>  One success has been the community initiative for energy efficiency.  It is a very successful scheme supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  It has achieved a lot of community involvement and has delivered improvements.  The Deputy has not only spoken about it but he visited a scheme today.  I saw him on the television visiting Tipperary where improvements in schools and in individual homes have been part of a very good scheme.  The renewable energy support scheme will have a community support framework built into it, so the larger-scale projects we need to deliver the targets we have committed to will be a part of that.  We also must ensure, and this is the underlying principle of the Bill, that microgeneration can be a part of that framework and can have a legal basis on which to enter the framework.  We will have to transpose a more detailed EU directive into Irish law, so by no means am I seeking to put off, delay or scupper legislation in this area.<\/p><p>We are committed to delivering legislation in this area, but I need to ensure that whatever legislation we bring in is the most cost-effective in terms of community engagement, that it is effective in meeting our obligations, and that it is effective in meeting the challenge of climate change.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their interest.  I have taken on this post and it is not something I had a great deal of familiarity with up to one month ago.  I see there is a huge challenge for all of us in the House.  It is not going to be a question of just picking the nice things we want to do.  There are also difficult aspects in this area.  I look forward to the support of the House and especially of the committee, which is sitting until the end of January, in this challenge.  I look forward to working with the House to try to come up with proposals that we can all get in behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543361700,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I welcome that the Government will not oppose the Bill and will support it.  I compliment Deputy Stanley on bringing the Bill forward.  I am very conscious of the issues around microgeneration.  For many years beside me in County Leitrim, Jimmy Dowds and Miriam Sheerin of offgrid.ie run a company called Eirbyte on the mountain at Aughnasheelin.  They run courses for people teaching them how to build their own home wind turbines.  They also sell solar panels and batteries and so on.  I have known them for 20 years and they are magnificent people doing magnificent work around all of that.  They have often said to me that there is a day and night of difference when they go to other countries in Europe and see how this sector is embraced there compared with how it is embraced in Ireland.  There is a sense in other countries of this is what we have to do, but in Ireland there are all kinds of obstacles, especially when it comes to the issue of the State being prepared to pay for people providing power into the grid.<\/p>  <p>  I take the point the Minister makes, but this is not about microgeneration not being able to provide everything.  We know that.  It is also about recognising that we have to change the culture.  Paying for microgeneration is part of changing that culture.  There is an issue too in respect of major generation, which is the massive wind turbines and the huge solar farms.  There is an opportunity for something in the middle.  I think of all the farmers' large cattle sheds, the roofs of which could easily provide a very large base for solar panels.  It should be one of the options for any new sheds that are being built.  Some incentive - a carrot or a stick or whatever way it needs to be done - could be provided to ensure the roofs of the sheds are facing south and are available for solar panels to installed.<\/p>  <p>  One of the big issues is about infrastructure, which is where we run into a problem.  I am aware that many people have looked to put fairly sizeable amounts of solar panels onto a roof, and they then discover that they cannot actually feed it into the grid even if the grid was paying for it.  The infrastructure is not in place.  We need to look at all of that and see how it is done.  It is my experience and I am sure it is also the Minister's experience that the vast majority of people are up for this and want to play their part.  They want to do these things and put in solar panels.  They want to provide electricity, for example, from the river that flows down at the back of their house if there could be some way of having a small hydro unit put in that they could use.  They want to do it but they need the assistance of the State.  I do not believe it is a huge cost because it is an investment that will pay back in the long run.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline a simple example, which other Deputies referred to earlier, with regard to electric cars.  I know many people in rural areas who would buy and use an electric car.  While the range may be a problem for some people, the main reason the range is a problem is because there are so few charging points, and perhaps when a person arrives at the charging point, another car is there.  This clogs up in people's minds.  They think that if they buy an electric car they will not be able to get anywhere in it.  This is because the infrastructure is not in place.  It is not because people do not want to do it.  This puts the issue back into the Government's court again to make sure it provides that infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to a money message.  I fear when I hear that in any of these debates.  It happens all the time when the Government brings up the argument that legislation will be a cost to the Exchequer, rather than it being an investment the Exchequer will have to make to get a return.  That is how this Bill has to be seen.  It is not just a financial return.  The Minister spoke about the carbon sequestration and what we need to do about it, so this could be a return in that regard also.  We have an obligation to ourselves and to future generations to sort out this mess.  We need to be up for it and make sure that we do whatever is required to provide for the future.  That is what we are doing.  It is providing for the future.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is excellent.  It provides a framework to start with.  The Minister spoke about the issues he has with the Bill, but those issues can all be dealt with and teased out on Committee Stage, and they can be added to or taken from.  We can do whatever needs to be done to ensure we can provide for the future.  The future clearly is for people to be facilitated in doing what they want to do, for the good of climate change and for the good of the future.<\/p>  <p>  I commend all the Deputies who supported the Bill.  I particularly commend Deputy Stanley and Cathal in his office who has worked so hard to bring the Bill forward and to ensure we can bring it into effect.  Let us hope it can come into effect speedily because time is not on our side when it comes to climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700062#KKK00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1543361700,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank everyone in the House for their support tonight.  I am aware that the Government has said it will not oppose the Bill, and I welcome that, but I also do not want the Minister to bury the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Climate change is here and we have huge obligations to meet.  We know we are not going to come within an ass's roar of it.  At best we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1% by 2020, instead of the minimum of 20% that we signed up to.  We are facing huge financial fines and there is a moral pressure on us.  There are small islands in parts of the Philippines that are being washed away.  Part of the Inishowen Peninsula was nearly washed away last year.<\/p>  <p>  The term \"domestic\" was used in the debate but there is no legal definition for that power output with regard to microgeneration.  There is a definition used by the ESB but it differs substantially from the definition used in Northern Ireland.  This can be used here.  We can adopt it to use for farms, buildings, schools and small businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Bmw Solar in Laois tells me that it has 40 small companies that want to put up solar panels but they cannot because of existing roadblocks around planning, feed-in tariffs and access to the grid.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill would assist rural development.  Without a doubt it would put funding into rural towns and villages.  I welcome the delegation in the Public Gallery tonight from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, who have shown a particular interest in this.  I welcome that they have come to the House tonight to sit through this debate.  They see this as an income stream for farmers so they need not rely on single products.  They look to see what else can add value.  They have taken this sensible approach and I commend them on it.  We want farmers and small businesses involved, alongside households.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation needs to be strong.  We take the points that were made about the market share of the suppliers who must provide tariffs for microgeneration.  There is an unpublished report from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland that says the potential in microgeneration could produce one fifth of Ireland's electricity.  That report was not published but it is there in black and white.<\/p>  <p>  I will now address some of the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan in his speech.  I welcome that the Government will not oppose the Bill, but I do not want him to bury the Bill by stealth using a money message.  The Minister of State also said that the Bill does not provide information on potential costs to the Exchequer.  We have to design the scheme.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, knows, because he has been around this House for longer than I have, that in reality one cannot design a scheme in detail in a Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not for throwing money at projects that are going to fail or are doomed.  We want to come up with solutions here.  That is what we are trying to do.  The Minister of State said that the Bill does not include any evidence or indicate the level of proposed tariff.  Again, the legislation is not the sensible place to set out the level of tariff.  That needs to be worked out separately.  I do not believe that detail should be in the primary legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan said that for those reasons \"the Government recommends that the Bill would undergo detailed scrutiny by the Oireachtas to discover the full cost of the proposals\".  That is a very elastic way to deal with it and it could be stretched as long as one wanted.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, as the new Minister in the job, and I ask it sincerely, are we going to use taxpayers' money to pay huge fines for not meeting our international obligations?  Are we going to use taxpayers' money to buy tax credits?  Are we going to continue to use the public service obligation levy on fossil fuels?<\/p><p>Alternatively, will we use it in a sensible way to put money into projects, for example, in my constituency of Laois-Offaly where Bord na M&oacute;na is being run down?  It is changing.  Many householders will need to generate an income by other means, as will a lot of small businesses.  We should grasp and use this opportunity and see it as a challenge to turn things in a different direction.  I refer to section 4 of the Bill which will give the Minister huge powers, for example, to draft regulations that may be revised and contain a minimum contractual price which a supplier must offer to microgenerators.  The Minister can set the minimum length of the contractual term of the tariff and amend the reference to applicable microgeneration equipment to allow for the use of new technology in the generation of electricity.<\/p> <p> We are trying to take on board what the Minister said in a constructive way, but I want him to let the Bill proceed to Committee Stage.  There are too many roadblocks in the way of microgeneration.  We should look at the position in Germany.  The Germans do not throw money to the four winds; neither do many other northern and southern European countries.  The system is too restrictive here in seeking planning permission for placing solar panels on domestic houses.  Grid connections are difficult to make and there is no feed-in tariff.  I refer to the model of the Tipperary Energy Agency.  We need to look at what it is doing and involve the other 34 local authorities.  We must move from being a laggard to a leader when it comes to tackling climate change and the use of renewable energy resources.  We have shown the way with the plastic bag levy and recycling.  The Minister and I remember being told 25 years ago that the public would not embrace recycling.  It has done so and now we are one of the leaders in Europe.  This is not a challenge for next year or the year after; it is a task for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700062#KKK00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543362300,"counter":536,"content":"<p>We are way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700063#LLL00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543362300,"counter":537,"content":"<p>We want the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage as soon as possible.
