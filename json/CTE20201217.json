To assist us in our examination of these matters and with regard to public health guidelines we are joined in person from Caranua by Ms Rachel Downes, CEO; Ms Sin&eacute;ad Dwyer, director of services; and Mr. Michael Fitzpatrick, director of finance and corporate governance.  We are joined remotely by Ms Jane Merrigan, head of communications at Caranua; and from the Department of Education by Ms Catherine Hynes, principal officer; and Mr. Hugh Geoghegan, assistant principal.  I welcome each of the witnesses to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.<\/p> <p>  I must explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Witnesses, however, are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory with regard to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard clearly on the sound system, and that when members are leaving and taking their seats to sanitise the area.  To assist the broadcasting service and the Debates Office, witnesses attending the meeting remotely should be called on by name and if not called upon by name, they should please state their name before beginning their contributions.<\/p> <p>  I now invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608204600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, more usually known as Caranua, was established in March 2013 under specific legislation.  The fund was established to receive and to hold voluntary contributions from certain religious congregations that in the past had run residential institutions for children.  The value of the contributions that could be received into the fund from the congregations was limited in the legislation to &euro;110 million, plus any interest accruing.  The money was ring-fenced for use to provide grants and supports for the benefit only of persons who had formerly been resident in the institutions.  Consequently, the support scheme was cash limited.<\/p> <p>  The types of approved support services for which grant funding was available were housing-related services, health and well-being services or education, learning and development services.  The services and supports provided were not to be a substitute for services otherwise already available to the applicants under existing public service schemes.  The Act also provided for the resources in the fund to be applied to pay the expenses necessarily incurred by Caranua in administering the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Contributions from the congregations were received in tranches, in parallel with the making of payments to applicants for support.  It is useful, therefore, to consider the transactions cumulatively.  The latest financial statements disclose that by 31 December 2019, Caranua had received the full &euro;110 million contribution from the congregations.  Accrued bank interest and investment returns totalling a further &euro;1.7 million meant that a total of &euro;111.7 million was available for use for the fund&rsquo;s statutory purposes.  A total of &euro;92.8 million had been paid out by way of grants or direct supports for eligible applicants.  A total of &euro;12.1 million had been used to fund Caranua&rsquo;s running costs, which average around &euro;2 million per year.  At 31 December 2019, there was a net balance of &euro;6.7 million remaining in the fund.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 financial statements signalled that the board expected to wind down Caranua&rsquo;s operations in an orderly way in 2020, having discharged almost all of its commitments to applicants and to creditors and having used almost all of the available funding.  On dissolution, any residual liabilities and assets are to be transferred to the Department of Education for finalisation.  This process has taken longer than expected and Caranua consequently continues in existence.  The Caranua and Department representatives will be able to provide the committee with an update in that regard.<\/p> <p>  My audit opinion in respect of Caranua&rsquo;s financial statements for 2019 draws attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control that weaknesses in the operation of the board&rsquo;s system of control over payments to applicants created a risk that grant expenditure in some cases may not have been used effectively for the purposes intended.<\/p><p>This is a concern to which I have also drawn attention in previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608204600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and ask Ms Downes from Caranua to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608204600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and the committee for inviting Caranua to discuss our 2019 financial statements.  I am Rachel Downes and I am here with my colleagues, Michael Fitzpatrick and Sinead Dwyer.<br\/><br\/>Caranua was established in 2013 as the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012.  Caranua is responsible for the management of a limited fund to improve the quality of life of people who, as children, experienced abuse and neglect in institutions and who have received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board, the Irish courts or a direct settlement with a congregation.  Although it is a public body, Caranua does not receive any State funding.  A limited fund of &euro;110 million was provided from religious congregations and an additional accrual of &euro;1.38 million in interest.  The Act states the fund provided to Caranua cannot exceed &euro;110 million, excluding interest.<br\/><br\/>Caranua began accepting applications in January 2014 and ceased making payments on 11 December 2020.  During this period, we received applications from 6,181 survivors.  By the end of November 2020, Caranua had made over 57,000 funding support payments to the value of &euro;97.1 million.  The average funding support received is &euro;15,728.  The highest provision of funding supports is in home improvements, at &euro;68.1 million, followed by health, &euro;27.2 million, education, &euro;1.4 million, and exceptional needs supports, &euro;400,000.<br\/><br\/>The legislation sets out that all operational costs must be met from the fund and over the lifespan of the organisation, &euro;13.4 million<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>has been spent on operations.  The board and management have worked determinedly to minimise operational costs and continue to do so during the wind-down.  The closure of the service was carefully managed to ensure that adequate resources were available to meet the requirements of survivors' applications.<br\/><br\/>Caranua has taken a flexible approach towards survivors&rsquo; applications.  However, with limited funds remaining, survivors are aware that funding support services are no longer available.  Over two years ago, in May 2018, plans for the orderly wind-down of the fund were announced.  In early 2019, Caranua began contacting survivors with open applications to discuss person-centred timelines for completion.  The board decided to extend the timeline for the completion of Caranua&rsquo;s services from June of this year to December in order to allow survivors impacted by Covid-19 restrictions additional time to complete their applications.  Also during 2020, as there was a surplus available, Caranua initiated a number of projects to re-engage with survivors who had not previously availed of their individual limit of &euro;15,000.<br\/><br\/>Caranua must strike a balance between working with survivors in a person-centred and compassionate manner and our obligations as a public body with fiduciary accountability.  While at times the process has been seen by some survivors as too onerous, Caranua needed to respond to the audit opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the context of controls.  As a public body, Caranua is required to follow Government procurement guidelines and this requirement extends to the provision of funding support services to survivors.  Survivors are, therefore, required to provide a specified number of quotations depending on the cost of the requested service.  However, operating as a person-centred organisation means that there have been occasions when it was decided to work outside of procedures to support the survivor.<br\/><br\/>Caranua continues to work in partnership with survivor support groups and counselling services including the Christine Buckley Centre, Right of Place Second Chance, Towards Healing Counselling Service, One in Four, the HSE national counselling service and Barnardos' origins tracing service to support the asks set out in the Facing the Future Together conference report.  They are the provision of an enhanced medical card for survivors and support with access to housing, continuation of free and easily accessible counselling services for survivors and their families and the provision of advocacy supports for survivors in the long term, including access to public services.  All medical and public service staff working in customer-facing roles should receive trauma-informed practice training.  Supports needed by survivors based outside of Ireland should also be identified.<br\/><br\/>As well as supplying funding supports, Caranua staff have provided advocacy services to many survivors, supporting them to access their rights and entitlements to public services, including communicating with local authorities regarding housing or repairs, or with hospitals to expedite appointments.  This service is no longer available and survivors may miss out unless other advocacy services are put in place.<br\/><br\/>Through our work with survivors, we have found that social isolation is a major issue and this has become more prevalent throughout the pandemic.  Many survivors regularly contact Caranua as we are their only social interaction.  Although we signpost to other agencies, many survivors take comfort from the fact that we are a survivor-specific organisation.  We have assisted survivors ranging from 28 to 100 years old.  While the majority are older, 32% are under the age of 60.  Experience has shown us that in this younger population, there is a higher incidence of imprisonment, homelessness, managing addiction or all three.<br\/><br\/>Caranua was delighted to be invited to a recent meeting with the Minister of Education, Deputy Foley, to discuss the ongoing needs of survivors.  This was a positive meeting which brought together survivor support groups and counselling services from Ireland and the UK.<br\/><br\/>The fund has been spent and Caranua&rsquo;s work is now complete.  However, we are happy to provide information and share our expertise in support of survivors.  I again thank the Chairperson and the committee for their interest in the work of Caranua and the ongoing needs of survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1608204600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for taking the time to be here.

For some survivors, that was difficult to do.<\/p> <p>  I suppose this is a recurring theme, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised the question of internal controls.  I will give an example of what we did on occasion.  We have had survivors who were in prison.  The services they may have required may have needed three quotes.  It may have been impossible for them to provide three quotes to Caranua.  We worked intensively with the Prison Service to try to facilitate that.  However, there are times when we take a decision that the person cannot be expected to provide three quotes and, therefore, we accept one or two quotes that the survivor can provide and then proceed with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1608204600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>At that point, Caranua makes a judgment on the quotes.

The survivor gave me permission to raise the case and I am particularly doing so, given that Caranua's report had positive cases so I might give voice to this case.

The last part of the email from Caranua to this survivor said: &quot;All of your needs have now been met with regards to Caranua and your application is complete.&quot;  That was on Monday morning.  On Monday afternoon, this survivor sent the following correspondence to Caranua.<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy application is not complete and what you have said in your email is not true.  I have a number of outstanding matters, including my bathroom, sitting room and kitchen floor.  My needs have not been met.  My home was damaged by workmen you paid to do work.  The defects were reported to you in 2016 and I also refer to the 2018 expert surveyor's report.  I have asked for funds to put right that damage.  I have made repeated requests for such help.  Finally, in October 2020, you agreed to put right some of the problems caused by your builder.  However, Caranua has refused to pay for the bathroom, sitting room and kitchen floor repairs.  Your part payment for the bathroom only covers just over half of the cost of the work and as you know, I do not have the money to make up the difference.  The fund was used to pay for substandard work.  My home is in disrepair.  Clearly, it is not correct for Caranua to continue to claim that all outstanding matters have been resolved.  The procedure to decide that a case is complete requires my knowledge and consent.  I do not consent.  The file is clearly not complete.  Once again, I call on Caranua to pay for the works to put right the damage caused to my home.  I want it noted that I have found the process nothing but stressful.  My health is now being affected by all of this.  I have made it known from the start that I did not want the said bathroom tiles.  These tiles are the same colour as the uniform that I wore in the orphanage.  Despite me voicing this opinion, I was repeatedly told that when they are fitted I would love them.  I am now reminded of unwanted memories that I wish to leave behind me.  I further feel that over the last six years, Caranua has been less than understanding when dealing with my concerns.  I don't deserve this treatment.  Have I not suffered enough? <\/blockquote> <p>Is that not an awful sad legacy as Caranua wraps up to leave behind from a survivor who has been dealing with it for six long years?  Ms Downes mentioned earlier that Caranua's remit was to improve the quality of life for people by helping survivors with housing-related issues and their health and well-being.  None of those were served for that survivor.  One would have to ask a question, therefore.  Where was the fairness, sensitivity, compassion and understanding shown to that survivor?  Do the witnesses agree that it is a shameful legacy?  There were survivors and some of them had referred to their experiences with Caranua as being re-abused.  Will Caranua take this opportunity, therefore, to apologise to those survivors who experienced Caranua's services in this way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#E01700","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608204600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Due to the committee protocols I am unable to discuss an individual-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#E01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1608204600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I am not asking Ms Downes to do that.

It is quite common for a survivor to send a cheque back in order to get the supplier name changed or when the cheque has expired.  As Mr. Fitzpatrick said, there is a process in place to do regular checks with people but we cannot make the survivor lodge a cheque in a particular period.  It has been running into the millions of euro over the years where cheques have had to be cancelled and reissued, with a follow-up required.  It is the nature of the process.<\/p> <p>  This year in particular the issue has been very complex because of the Covid-19 restrictions.

I do not want to dwell on specific cases but I am familiar with a few cases and I just wanted to say this to be helpful.  Public representatives here would know about this, particularly those who were councillors.  With local authorities sometimes a person will make an application for a grant and the higher up in an office it goes the better the chance of it actually being dealt with face to face.  I do not mean to be smart but I will make a suggestion.  There are two cases, which I do not want to go into, but one thing struck me when I looked at them.  Maybe some of this has been done already.  Local authorities have somebody like a clerk of works, who is not a highly qualified individual.  They generally come from the trades and are at the same level as the site foreman or whoever.  Usually they come from the carpentry trade because they intervene at several stages in the development of any construction project and they are seen as having good all-round knowledge.  One of the things that would be helpful is if a clerk of works, the preferred bidder and the client were able to meet on site.  With the funding available, when people go on site and look at what is there, what the person needs and what is possible, they can join up the ends.  We could argue about that in this room and Caranua could do so within its office structure.  I am not being in any way disparaging about that.  I am trying to be practical.  I worked in construction, although I am not an expert in it, and I am a public representative.  In my experience, if one gets a clerk of works, the client or constituent and whoever is doing the job on site, even if there is only a certain amount of money to do it, with 20 minutes or half an hour spent like that and a bit of tick-tacking for a week or so afterwards, the ends can be joined up.  I ask that Ms Downes takes that point.  I am saying it in a very helpful way.  Perhaps the clerk of works or a technician could do that.  It does not have to be someone highly qualified but someone who has a practical mind, who understands these things and is prepared to put on a pair of Wellington boots and go out on the site and meet the other two people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#L01500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608204600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for that guidance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Downes"},{"type":"speech","time":1608204600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am just saying that by way of being helpful and I ask Ms Downes to take that away with her.

This matter came before the Committee of Public Accounts and there was a newspaper article at the time that reiterated the concerns some of us had.  Survivors said that they were left for months without a response and were told they would get no support if they made contact again.  Some of them were in tears and felt retraumatised.  That was the kind of stuff that was said, to the point that a solicitor was working with a group of about 40 survivors who said they wanted Caranua wound down.  That was what was said.  When we talk about survivors, we are talking about people who survived Artane, Goldenbridge, Letterfrack and the myriad other locations.  The reality of it is that these are people who are not prone to complaining.  People did not survive if they complained.<\/p> <p>  I am getting angry sitting here this morning.  I have never seen a more defensive response to a committee regarding complaints.  Legitimate complaints were made by people.  There are many people within that survivor group who will not complain but that does not mean there is not dissatisfaction.  It should be acknowledged that there is dissatisfaction.  This is a very different group.  This money that was provided by the congregations was not about philanthropy.  It was in return for work people did and that work was done because they were not educated.  They worked instead of being educated and they have high levels of illiteracy.  I know some of these people and so do some of the rest of us.  I just do not think this defensive approach is fair to those people.  I rarely get as angry as I have while sat here and I have been getting angrier and angrier as the morning has gone on.  This is not helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121700002#L01800","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608204600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am sorry the Deputy feels that way.

I cannot respond as I do not know what information the committee has received but it has obviously created a lot of concern for Deputies.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two years in particular, Caranua has engaged intensively with survivor support groups and counselling services and we have asked for guidance and advice to feed back.  I do not think Caranua would have been invited to be part of the organising committee for the conference if the survivor support groups that were working day in, day out with survivors felt as the Deputy does.  We are working day in, day out with survivors and we have their best interests at heart in everything we do.  I have worked with some of the most dedicated people in my four years in Caranua.  Nobody is setting out to upset survivors.  That is not our aim.  We know what survivors have been through.  Our aim is to work with survivors to try to ensure they get the best possible outcome out of the funding supports available to them.  As I said, while our remit is funding supports our role has gone above and beyond that and includes the advocacy supports we offer on a daily basis and social interactions.  So many survivors contact us all the time just to say we are the only people they can talk to and the only voice at the end of the phone.
