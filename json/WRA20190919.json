Immediately after the June 2020 closing date, my Department will conduct an initial screening of all proposals received before transmitting them to an expert advisory group, which will make recommendations as to which sites should be included on the new Tentative List.

A number of meetings have already taken place with local authorities under this new round and information events are planned for communities with potential Tentative List sites in their areas.  My Department's policy is for applications to be sponsored by the relevant local authority or other statutory body in order to ensure continuity throughout the process. Individuals or other organisations are encouraged to apply in collaboration with the relevant local authority. The role of the local authority is crucial in order to facilitate public consultation and wider stakeholder engagement, particularly in light of the requirement under the UNESCO Operational Guidelines for participatory planning and stakeholder consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The most critical element when determining whether a site should be included on the Tentative List is the potential of the property to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value, meaning that its significance is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations.

Under the scheme, the profits or gains arising to a writer, composer, visual artist or sculptor from the publication, production or sale of his or her work is exempt from income tax.   Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 empowers Revenue to make a determination that certain artistic works are original and creative works generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Where a determination is not made in effect the application is rejected. There is a right of appeal to an independent appeal body where the Revenue declines to issue a determination. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme provides that Revenue can make determinations in respect of artistic works in the following categories only:<\/p>  <p>  1. a book or other writing<\/p>  <p>  2. a play<\/p>  <p>  3. a musical composition<\/p>  <p>  4. a painting or other like picture<\/p>  <p>  5. a sculpture.<\/p>  <p>  Where a determination is made by Revenue in respect of a work, income arising from that work, up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 per annum, is exempt from income tax.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposals to extend the Artists Tax Exemption Scheme are a matter for the Minister for Finance and while there are no plans at this point to extend the scheme, I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to be proactive in seeking ways to support artists. We recognise the crucial role that the arts and culture play in our nation and have made significant progress on our public commitment to double funding for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht by 2025. In Budget 2019, funding for arts and culture increased by &euro;22.6m to almost &euro;190m, an increase of 14% on 2018. Initiatives such as the review of the Percent for Arts Scheme, and Social Welfare for Self-Employed Artists which I announced earlier this year, are also providing tangible support to our valued artistic community. The latter initiative  recognises the unique creative circumstances of artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output.  From this month, self-employed artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance for the first year that they are out of work can focus on their artistic work and developing their portfolio, rather than having to participate in the normal labour market activation activities. Artists eligible to apply to the scheme include actors, theatre and film directors, dancers, opera singers, set, costume and lighting designers, musicians, composers, choreographers, architects and street performers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Disease Controls","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[37937\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps she has taken in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to address the deadly rabbit haemorrhagic disease which originated in China and has now been found in some animals in the wild in counties Wicklow, Clare and Wexford; and if it is a threat to the native hare population here","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) was first reported in domestic (farmed) rabbits in China in 1984.

The work of Culture Ireland is focused not just on promoting Ireland but also increasing career opportunities for Irish artists.<\/p><p>In tandem with securing additional funding, my Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit.  In that context, the Deputy may be aware that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is undertaking an audit of the independent film and television drama production sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedures, assessing issues arising (if any), and making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.  In this regard, the WRC has invited submissions on these matters by 31 October, 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[37880\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the provisions her Department has put in place to protect the film and television industry in the event of a no-deal Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>Many of the key concerns for the arts and culture sector, encompassing the film and television industry arising from a no-deal Brexit are not sector specific - they relate to the implications of exchange rate movements and free movement of people, goods and services on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and the UK. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government published a Contingency Action Plan in December 2018 setting out its approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit with an updated report launched in July 2019.  In addition, in May this year, the Irish and UK Governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming a joint commitment to the Common Travel Area (CTA), and to maintaining the associated rights and privileges of Irish and British citizens under this long-standing arrangement. However, Brexit is a major strategic challenge to Ireland as a whole and there remains a range of potential outcomes that depend on the exact nature of the future relationship between the UK and Europe. With 6 weeks to go until a possible no deal Brexit, it is vital that the film and television industry, like all others, step up preparations. <\/p>  <p>  In relation specifically to the cultural sector, the Government has increased investment in arts and culture in recent years in part as a mitigation measure against Brexit. This includes funding of over &euro;20m for Screen Ireland in 2019 as part of a &euro;200m Audiovisual Action Plan. A key recommendation of the Audiovisual Action Plan was that Ireland should sign up the revised European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production which would allow a straightforward mechanism of facilitating potential co-productions which would otherwise not be feasible. In May this year, Ireland signed and ratified the treaty which has also been signed by the UK. While it has not yet ratified the revised Convention, the decision by the UK to sign it has been regarded by some as symbolic of its determination to continued cooperation with European countries, and other international territories, on a multilateral basis in the audiovisual sector, regardless of the outcome of Brexit. The UK will still remain members of the Council of Europe and will therefore still be parties to the European Convention on Cinematographic Coproduction, the treaty under which most European Co-productions involving Screen Ireland funding are made. <\/p>  <p>  It is possible the Brexit will offer opportunities to Ireland as the only major English-language market that will remain in the EU and, in that regard, my Department, through its role in implementing the Audiovisual Action Plan, continues its work to support the Government&rsquo;s ambition to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[37723\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she plans the development of various historical and heritage sites or buildings nationally with a view to maximising public interest in the context of both the domestic population and tourists; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[38007\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900055#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which preservation or restoration works under her aegis have been undertaken at various historical sites and buildings by county nationally; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 266 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to the Deputy for his enduring personal interest in my Department's efforts to conserve, present and promote the unique range of cultural and heritage assets, both natural and built, that Ireland is fortunate enough to possess and that do so much to provide enjoyment and amenities for our people, to sustain and create identities for our communities and to generate tourism interest in our country throughout the world.<\/p>  <p>  My replies to the Deputy's previous Question No. 65 on 16 January 2019 and Questions Nos. 216, 217 and 220 on 10 April 2019 provide a good insight into the  work being done by my Department in this area and especially in relation to National Monuments.<\/p>  <p>  I would also refer the Deputy to the reply Question No. 37433\/19 for answer today as this emphasises the work I'm doing in relation to our National Parks, and I know that this too will interest the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In July of last year, as part of this partnership, we published Experiencing the Wild heart of Ireland &ndash; A Tourism Interpretative Masterplan for the National Parks and Nature Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  The plan recommends a suite of capital projects of varying sizes.

The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl which often swallow small pieces of hard materials such as gravel and the like, to assist the maceration of vegetable matter in their gizzard.  My Department&rsquo;s position is to support the AEWA commitment to phase out the use of lead shot over wetlands.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission have published an initial draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).

The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years\u00a0various representations have been received\u00a0in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of \"A\" Company.

It is important to point out that this measure ensures equity between all citizens with incomes in excess of &euro;60,000, while ensuring that those aged over 70 and medical card holders on more modest incomes do not suffer the higher rates of USC.

As with other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences such as failure to submit returns or other documentation or the provision of false information. Section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the imposition of surcharges for the late payment of Local Property Tax. <\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a person is penalised for the late submission (or non-submission) of an income tax return by the imposition of a surcharge on his or her income tax liability. However, a person who has submitted his or her income tax return on time can also be liable to an income tax surcharge in respect of the late submission of his or her LPT return or the failure to pay LPT. \u00a0Where a liable person has not submitted his or her LPT return by the time that he or she submits an income tax return, the income tax liability is increased by 10% up to a maximum increase of &euro;63,485. \u00a0Where the LPT return is subsequently submitted and the associated LPT liability is paid, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue can require employers and pension providers to mandatorily deduct LPT at source from a person&rsquo;s wages or pension, where the person fails to comply with his or her LPT obligations. <\/p>  <p>  As such an enforcement option can apply in the case of PAYE taxpayers, it is considered that linking non-compliance with LPT by self-employed persons with a surcharge on their income tax liabilities is both fair and proportionate. The challenge of compliance is particularly significant for LPT owing to the nature of the tax itself and the wide demographic liable for the tax, a significant proportion of which are not taxpayers to whom the standard collection and enforcement methods could be applied. <\/p>  <p>  Given the level of LPT liability for most property owners, the application of a 10% surcharge on a person&rsquo;s LPT liability alone would be unlikely to act as an effective deterrent to non-compliance.\u00a0 As I have already stated, having incurred a surcharge, a self-employed person has the opportunity to cap the surcharge at the amount of the LPT liability due by submitting an LPT return and\/or paying the LPT liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900056#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900056#WRC03900"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[37965\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900056#WRC04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the VAT proposals on food supplements in view of the publication of the tax strategy group papers in summer 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[37966\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900056#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he or his officials received correspondence from an organisation (details supplied) on VAT on food supplements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.<\/p><p>My Department carried out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products,\u00a0which sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, and the Minister for Health.

The review found there is a lack of competitiveness in the sector and that if the 9% rate were to be increased, this would likely not materially impact demand or employment in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than to price changes. The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.\u00a0 Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term.

The reason is that there are currently no data available that would enable such calculations to be made. The Deputy will be aware that in Finance Bill 2018 I re-imposed an upper salary ceiling of &euro;1 million on the relief with effect of 1 January 2019 for new entrants and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020.\u00a0Such data as are available within the system relate to years before 2019 (no cap existed between 2015 and 2019). It would therefore be necessary to assess the cost-saving impact of the cap as well as taking account of evolution in the take up of the relief during the current year in order to begin to estimate the savings or costs that might arise in 2020 or subsequent years.\u00a0 Also, the further ahead we seek to look, the more speculative such estimates are likely to be as assumptions for one year are placed on top of those for the preceding year.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines, SARP is currently the subject of an independent review, carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.

The Government sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.<\/p><p>These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. My Department had previously carried out an extensive analysis exercise to establish the potential volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This exercise has been used, where appropriate, to guide relevant planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required. <\/p><p>Regarding staffing requirements, at all stages, my Department has sought to use a combination of recruitment, redeployment and temporary flexible solutions, such as contracted veterinary services, where appropriate and as necessary. Given the level of uncertainty surrounding Brexit, my Department&rsquo;s approach has been to adopt, where possible, options that offer a degree of flexibility, such as internal short term redeployment and contracted services, whilst ensuring, in conjunction and cooperation with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service (PAS), that avenues for more permanent recruitment are available and can be drawn from as necessary. This approach is with a view to being able to address requirements in the near to medium term across various possible contingencies, from the negative end of the spectrum in terms of a no deal-Brexit to more benign contingencies of a Brexit based on a deal between the EU and the UK. <\/p><p>Focussing on immediate initial requirements, in the area of East-West import and export controls for UK product into Ireland, in the event of a no-deal Brexit on October 31st, my Department will have 240 staff resources available across a range of disciplines in both front line control and back up administrative spheres. This overall number will include recruits, redeployed staff and contracted Private Veterinary Practitioners (PVPs  <b>)<\/b><\/p><p>Overall, the key grades where the majority of deployment will occur are in veterinary and portal inspector roles on the animals and products of animal origin side, as well as agricultural and forestry inspectors and portal inspectors on the plant health and forestry side. In terms of recruitment, engagement with PAS is ongoing<\/p><p>It is important to note that staffing estimates are provided on the basis of a disorderly Brexit using the infrastructure that is expected to be available in Dublin and Rosslare ports in October. The development of additional infrastructure has the potential to have a knock-on effect on the numbers of staff required, and this contingency is being actively examined. Estimates may also need to be revised in light of any new political developments or on foot of any changes to the UK&rsquo;s requirements, particularly regarding export certification.<\/p><p>In the context of an initial uncertain period in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it will be necessary to carefully observe how operational arrangements with respect to staffing are bedding down. Furthermore, it will also be necessary to observe how a no-deal Brexit might evolve, given the ongoing potential staffing effects.<\/p><p>I remain confident that my Department is in a position to deliver the services required\u00a0in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900061#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":477,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 answered with Question No. 170.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Weather Events","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900061#WRH02800"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[38136\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900061#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if assistance will be provided to farmers in the Shannon Callows who have lost fodder, aftergrass and to those that have been forced to house cattle early due to flooding; the engagement that he has had with Waterways Ireland and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht regarding works at Meelick weir; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>I am\u00a0aware of the\u00a0impact that recent bouts of unfavourable\u00a0weather has had on farmers in certain regions including the Shannon Callows.\u00a0\u00a0 As you will be aware, the Minister of State for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief, Mr.\u00a0Kevin\u00a0\u00a0Moran\u00a0T.D., recently announced\u00a0a range of measures to alleviate flooding in\u00a0the affected area.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In recognising the major challenges faced by the\u00a0farming sector and the important role that various schemes operated by my Department play in underpinning the viability of many farms, last month\u00a0I secured agreement from the European Commission that will allow for\u00a0a higher rate of advance payments under the 2019 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and a number of Rural Development Schemes. <\/p>  <p>In this regard, the rate of advance payment payable under\u00a0the BPS from 16th   October has been increased from 50% to 70%.\u00a0 In addition, the rate of advance payments under Rural Development schemes such as GLAS and the Sheep Welfare Scheme has been increased from 75% to 85%.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally,\u00a0I have secured a funding\u00a0increase to the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme\u00a0which brings the total budget\u00a0this year to &euro;250m.\u00a0 On foot of changes to EU Regulations, payments under the ANC Scheme will be made in two instalments this year.\u00a0 The initial instalment of 85% worth &euro;168.5m is scheduled to commence this week, with the\u00a0balancing payments of 15% commencing in early December.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding Early Learning and Care and School Age childcare programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. Ensuring that this money is properly accounted for, and that as many children as possible benefit from it, is a core responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Pobal assists the Department in the administration of the funding and in ensuring that services are compliant with the clearly documented rules of the various early learning and care and school age childcare schemes.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Public Accounts Committee on June 13 paid significant attention to this matter and highlighted the importance of compliance with scheme rules. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs' approach to compliance, and supporting services, strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. The approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended through a strong compliance function.<\/p>  <p>  Part of Pobal&rsquo;s role in overseeing compliance with programme rules is to carry out unannounced visits to services to check their compliance with programme rules. Subsidies for the Early Learning and Care and School Age childcare programmes are paid based on child attendance, which is a vital governance component of the funding for which the Department is responsible. Where Pobal discover that the actual pattern of attendance of a child does not match registrations for that child on Pobal&rsquo;s Programme Implementation Platform (IT system) they will calculate the amount of funding that has been overclaimed. The service will be advised by Pobal to make the necessary corrections to PIP registrations to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There is an appropriate amount of flexibility applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case by case basis. Attendance rules and their application do not penalise parents who occasionally pick up or drop off children early. Pobal, when determining a pattern of attendance during a compliance visit, aim to apply the rules in a manner which maximises the amount payable to providers. However, the recovery of overclaimed funds is an integral part of ensuring that public money is properly accounted for.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2018 to June 2019 (the latest available figures) Pobal identified 277 CCS services and 712 CCSP services with overclaims. It should be noted that some services have both a CCS and CCSP contract.<\/p>  <p>  The total amount of overclaimed funding identified by Pobal for the same period was &euro;3.2 million in CCS and &euro;2.5 million in CCSP. It is important to note that these overclaim figures are calculated at the time of the compliance visit but cover the full period of children&rsquo;s registration. They calculate any discrepancies up to the compliance visit date plus the amount that would have been overclaimed if the incorrect registration had persisted to the end of the programme year. In addition, an assumption is made that the level of attendance at the time of the visit will continue for the rest of the cycle (or duration of the registration if less). Overclaim figures therefore estimate the total amount that would have been overclaimed across the year had the compliance visit not occurred. Whilst the above amounts of overclaim were identified, some services made the case that they had registered children under the wrong scheme and hence corrections were accepted by Pobal, lessening the amount of overclaim significantly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the subvention for CCS and CCSP is paid to a service based on the actual attendance of a child. As such, no child should have had their provision cut as a result of a compliance visit; rather the service makes corrections to ensure that they are claiming for the actual time that the child is in attendance. It is important to note that the compliance activity should result in the service provider only claiming from the Department for the hours the child is attending. Data available to the Department shows that the number of children accessing Government subsidies continues to increase and has doubled in recent years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City \/ County Childcare Committees and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care services in difficulty. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the Case Management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues and following a financial assessment by Pobal. This includes a strand of funding targeted at community services requiring support to sustainably regularise their registrations.<\/p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme.

As such, Ireland has designated 439 sites as special areas of conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive and classified 154 sites as special protection areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive.  Under national legislation, SACs and SPAs are collectively termed &lsquo;European sites&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  To protect the habitats and species in the European sites for which they are designated, and to avoid accidental or deliberate damage in these sites, it is necessary to have in place a system by which potentially damaging activities require consent before they can be carried out. <\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Activities Requiring Consent&rsquo; are specific activities which must not be carried out on a European site unless prior consent is given by me, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, or by another relevant public authority.  This safeguard ensures that the potential effects of the activity on the European site are assessed before works are carried out. Also that consent is granted only after having determined that the activity will not adversely affect the integrity of the European Site.<\/p>  <p>  The Salmon Conservation Fund is an initiative of Inland Fisheries Ireland, launched in 2007, in order to fund rehabilitation, protection and conservation projects, all of which must focus on salmon.

It has a vision for a vibrant, creative and sustainable Irish film, television and animation industry, with diverse voices, talent and opportunities which speaks to and connects Irish film culture with audiences at home and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  Screen Ireland also works in conjunction with the enterprise agencies to support the development of the film sector to make a substantial contribution to inward investment. It promotes Ireland as a location for international production by providing advice and support for international companies seeking to locate production activity to Ireland, organising inward and outward trade missions on an annual basis and working in partnership with EU counterparts on co-productions. In April 2018, I joined with the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, in launching my Department&rsquo;s capital investment plan: 'Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 - 2027&rsquo;. This plan incorporated an amount of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and the audiovisual industry over the next 10 years and represented a first step in the Government&rsquo;s ambitions to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. The investment will be delivered through Screen Ireland whose budget for 2019 was increased to &euro;20 million. <\/p>  <p>  Government policy also supports the sector through Section 481 tax relief, international film co-production treaties, an annual international programme of Irish film festivals, and through engaging high-profile talent to project a positive image of Ireland and reflect Ireland as a creative place. Earlier this year, I was pleased to welcome EU Commission approval in respect of two aspects of Irelands tax credit: the extension of the Section 481 credit until 2024 provides certainty for film production companies on the future availability of the credit, ensuring the continued growth of our film industry. It is a key recommendation in the Audiovisual Action Plan, the industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland Programme. A further key measure under the Plan saw the introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift which offers an additional tapered tax credit over a period of 4 years. This is an important step in support of this Government&rsquo;s ambition to make Ireland a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation in supporting creative talent in Ireland and helping to develop a vibrant creative audio-visual sector throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0will continue to work to\u00a0support the development and expansion of the film and television production sector. In that regard\u00a0my Department will continue to work\u00a0with Screen Ireland to ensure that Ireland is maximised as a location for both indigenous and international film production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900064#WRL06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900064#WRL06400"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[38011\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091900064#WRL06500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she has offered assistance towards specific developments in the arts such as music and drama events at local or community level; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>Support for the arts is a key focus of the supports provided by my Department and its agencies.\u00a0 My Department is involved in a very wide range and cultural events numbering\u00a0several thousand each year and I will try to give\u00a0a flavour of these in this reply.\u00a0<\/p><p>Culture Night takes place tomorrow 20th September 2019 all over Ireland and it is run by my Department in conjunction with\u00a0local authorities and other partners.Culture Night is now in its 14th year.\u00a0 It has grown from a relatively small scale cultural event staged only in Dublin in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is, with over 400,000 people visiting Museums, galleries, historic houses, artists&rsquo; studios and cultural centres across the country on the night.
