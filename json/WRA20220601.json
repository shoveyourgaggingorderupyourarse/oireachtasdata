In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty\u00a0when\u00a0energy\u00a0prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their\u00a0energy\u00a0needs increases.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free\u00a0energy\u00a0efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable\u00a0Energy\u00a0Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty\u00a0retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. Recognising the unprecedented rise in\u00a0energy\u00a0prices facing people the Government put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:<\/p>  <p>  -an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March.<\/p>  <p>  - the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to domestic electricity accounts.<\/p>  <p>  - specific measures in the new National Retrofit Schemes to support householders in taking actions to reduce\u00a0energy\u00a0bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.<\/p>  <p>  -To further manage the impact of price increases the Government, in the recently published National\u00a0Energy\u00a0Security Framework, announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:<\/p>  <p>  - A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  -A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.<\/p>  <p>  -A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.<\/p>  <p>  -The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.<\/p>  <p>  -A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.<\/p>  <p>  -An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  -The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above,\u00a0electricity and gas suppliers,\u00a0overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary\u00a0Energy\u00a0Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance\u00a0available.<\/p>  <p>  A research network on fuel\u00a0poverty\u00a0chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The Group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable\u00a0Energy\u00a0Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel\u00a0poverty\u00a0in Ireland.

Some of the main features of the current regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base. Changing the tax rate (or imposing additional levies on certain sectors) could have unforeseen consequences. There is a risk of such taxes leading to higher consumer costs and negative impacts on investment in the energy sector, in particular in the area of renewables. <\/p>  <p>  Proposals for a windfall tax must take into account wider energy policy, under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. A well-functioning EU electricity market is crucial for the integration of our Internal Energy Market and supporting investment in new renewables. The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. <\/p>  <p>  The complexities of the energy market and the range of producers and contracts must also be taken into account. For example, the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy. <\/p>  <p>  The Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework on the 13th April. It set out that the Government will work with the European Commission and other Member States to consider the policy proposals outlined under REPowerEU, designed to aid consumers and businesses to deal with increasing energy costs. REPowerEU is a joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy.\u00a0 The European Commission published the REPowerEU Plan on 18 May and analysis of these proposals is currently being undertaken.\u00a0 Consideration of the potential for a windfall tax is a small part of ongoing work in this area. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy. This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country; reductions in fuel excise duty; and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100064#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":98,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100064#WRC02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100064#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[28203\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100064#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the attention of her Department has been drawn to the change in the ownership and company structure at an organisation (details supplied); her views on whether this changed structure means that the organisation is ineligible to draw down the Sports Capital Grant awarded to it in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,100 applications were submitted.

We have raised these concerns, along with our partners in the EU and the wider international community, on a number of occasions, both at Ministerial and official level.\u00a0 I raised these issues directly with my Chinese counterpart, State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during a visit to China in May 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also been active on Xinjiang in the United Nations framework. At the 49th United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2022, Ireland&rsquo;s national statement called on China to comply with its obligations under national and international law to respect and protect human rights in Xinjiang.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2021, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on the situation in Xinjiang, delivered at the Third Committee of the 76th UN General Assembly. The statement calls attention to the arbitrary detention of over a million people in Xinjiang and the &ldquo;systematic human rights violations, including reports documenting torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue also provides opportunity to raise specific concerns, including in relation to Xinjiang. Ireland and our EU partners remain committed to ensuring that the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue resumes as soon as possible and I am encouraged by the progress made in this regard at the EU-China Summit in April this year. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has also initiated sanctions under the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime against four Chinese persons and one entity for their role in Xinjiang. These sanctions are designed to act as a deterrent and encourage changes in these actors&rsquo; behaviour. Sanctions are based on solid legal evidence and are deployed alongside other measures, including dialogue. <\/p>  <p>  Through our Embassy in Beijing Ireland closely followed the visit to China of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet. Ireland had been calling for this visit, and for full, meaningful and unfettered access for the High Commissioner and her team. High Commissioner Bachelet visited Kashgar and Urumqi, both cities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, along with Guangzhou in southern China. We are now assessing the outcome of this trip and we will continue to call for the publication of the High Commissioner&rsquo;s full report on the situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asks about a designation of genocide. It is a term that has a particular meaning under international law and the recognition of events definitively as genocide involves a complex analysis of both facts and law. Ireland follows the practice of recognising genocide only where this has been established by a final decision of a court in Ireland or a judgment of an international court, or where there is international consensus on the matter. To date, this has not been the case as regards the situation in Xinjiang.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's practice in this regard does not undermine the seriousness with which the Government approaches the situation in Xinjiang.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online and Passport Online is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in \"Post Passport\" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices. A paper-based, mail-in service is also available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. The Passport Service continues to see a steady, but increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.<\/p>  <p>  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed over 5,000 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100066#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[28442\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100066#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff who are operating the Houses of the Oireachtas passport helpline for elected members; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the number is constantly engaged; his views on whether it is acceptable for elected representatives and their office staff to be expected to make up to 20 queries per day relating to passports (details supplied); if he will ensure that elected members and their staff are not held responsible for failings at the Passport Office with members of the public where he has overall Ministerial responsibility; if he will issue a public announcement to this effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>In October 2021, the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0established a temporary phone\u00a0line\u00a0to respond to\u00a0Oireachtas\u00a0Members' queries on urgent passport cases.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that it can, on occasion, be challenging for Members of the Oireachtas and their staff to access the Oireachtas line given the volume queries that the team are currently handling. Staff on the\u00a0Oireachtas Line\u00a0continue to work productively under increasing pressure.

In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 470,000 passports by the end of May. In the same time period this year, over 540,000 passports have been issued. In 2021, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In five months the Passport Service has issued over 80% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.<\/p>  <p>  Passport applicants can track the status of their passport application online via the Passport Tracker which is available on my Department's website - www.dfa.ie\/passporttracking\/.

There\u00a0is no\u00a0published official\u00a0record of the meeting\u00a0meeting of 23 May.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is considered\u00a0useful for Ireland to avail of\u00a0all\u00a0appropriate opportunities for high-level and diplomatic engagement on issues relating to Ukraine, particularly as regards the long-term perspectives for the conflict, the potential scenarios ahead, including any eventual pathway to a negotiated solution, as well as the wider transformation of the European security landscape.<\/p>  <p>  The next meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group will take place in Brussels on 15 June and it is expected that Ireland will be represented once again at senior official and Defence Force level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100066#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Security","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100067#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[28342\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100067#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of unidentified aerial phenomena that were recorded by the Defence Forces in Ireland in the period since World War II; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[28343\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100067#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if Irish authorities have engaged in any way with representatives of other governments, particularly the United States on the subject of unidentified aerial phenomena; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[28344\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100067#WRF00500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he or members of his Department have had the opportunity to review the findings of the United States House Intelligence, Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation Subcommittee hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena, which took place in Washington earlier in May 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 142 and 143 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has not had any engagement with external bodies or other States in relation to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and there are no contemporary recordings of sightings or otherwise of UAPs\u00a0by the Defence Forces.

It is envisaged that this draft proposal, which would be voluntary for parents\/guardians and children could present a more suitable option than Home Tuition for some children as they await a special class placement. Many of these families are having difficulties in securing a tutor for this work. Families would now have access to an alternative to Home Tuition providing them with\u00a0<\/p><p>1. Access to fully qualified teachers removing the burden of sourcing an appropriately qualified home tutor<\/p><p>2. An opportunity for their child(ren) to interact with their peers and access education in a school\/classroom environment which is &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo;<\/p><p>3. Integration opportunities, where possible, on a case by case basis. <\/p><p>It is envisaged that these centres would follow the standard school day and school year. It is intended that the Centres will be located to facilitate engagement with local schools with a view to optimising integration opportunities for children in local schools. Integration and transition arrangements for local schools and the SEN Centres will be developed by the NCSE in conjunction with the Inspectorate and NEPs. These arrangements will be kept under continuing review by the ETBs, the Department and the NCSE.<\/p><p>The Centres would also be located in areas where additional special class provision is due to come on stream as various building projects progress. <\/p><p>I must highlight that this proposal is very much at an early stage and further significant work is required to progress the proposal and further work is required in relation to engaging with key stakeholders and advocacy groups on the draft proposal. A further meeting with advocacy groups on the draft proposal is scheduled for later this week. <\/p><p>Families can be assured that the Department and NCSE remain committed to opening special classes as quickly as possible and this proposal is offered as a child and family centred interim solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100067#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":249,"content":"<p>Question No. 148 answered with Question No. 147.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[28259\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100067#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the plans that her Department has to increase ASD places in a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p><p>This\u00a0year, my Department will\u00a0spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>This includes additional teaching and care supports. <\/p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.\u00a0<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. <\/p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering.

We should not take for granted the huge achievement of the Garda&iacute; in patiently and quietly harnessing this necessary coalition of support for their work to combat this criminal group.<\/p>  <p>  The sanctions enforced internationally should send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang; that your criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100069#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[28209\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100069#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which official Government policy prevails to ensure the deployment of adequate number of garda&iacute; in all areas throughout the country with particular reference to the need to impede crime, potential or otherwise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government\u00a0is committed to ensuring that there is strong, visible policing throughout the country.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes decisions on the deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.<\/p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation of over &euro;2 billion for 2022.\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a strong tradition of community engagement and visible policing, and this funding demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources required to build on this high level of engagement and to ensure our communities are safe.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I was pleased to attend the Garda College in Templemore on 19 May, where 101 new Garda members passed-out.

All outputs from this consultation will help form the new Strategy and in turn the new Forestry Programme.<\/p><p>It is our aim that the next Forestry Programme will  be designed to encourage a substantially increased uptake of a wide range of afforestation measures. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Hectares of grant aided forestry planted<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 <\/td>       <td>6,652.02 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 <\/td>       <td>6,252.06 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 <\/td>       <td>6,156.41 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 <\/td>       <td>6,292.81 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>6,499.80 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>5,535.75 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>4,025.48 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>3,549.89 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>2,434.32 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>2,016.48 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Area licensed for Thinning (Ha)<\/th>       <th>Area licensed for Clearfell (Ha)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 13,390<\/td>       <td>3,493<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 15,450<\/td>       <td>6,564<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 16,014<\/td>       <td>\u00a0\u00a012,012<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 16,916<\/td>       <td>\u00a0\u00a011,583<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>154,397<\/td>       <td>9,780<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 26,977<\/td>       <td>\u00a0\u00a010,113<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 25,688<\/td>       <td>\u00a0\u00a014,157<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 47,571<\/td>       <td>9,626<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>7,605<\/td>       <td>\u00a0\u00a011,870<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>\u00a0 12,494<\/td>       <td>\u00a0\u00a020,709<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100071#WRK04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Passports","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100071#WRK04800"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[28249\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060100071#WRK04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason that a change has been made to the passport for equines (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>Current legislation governing the transfer of ownership of equine animals is\u00a0S.I. 201 of 2016.
