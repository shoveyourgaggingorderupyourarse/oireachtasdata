Temporary re-assignments of resources to meet the challenges of the Covid response has impacted on aspects of this work. <\/p>  <p>  The PSPC report contains a broad range of recommendations which provided immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. <\/p>  <p>  Immediate benefits included a 10% increase in military service allowance; the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances; the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties and the restoration of a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots. <\/p>  <p>  The Report provides for an examination of pay structures in the PDF and the identification of other retention measures, which are due to be progressed within the framework of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations. The Report also contains a range of other recommendations including a review of recruitment methods, enhanced workforce planning, enhanced professional military education, bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF, the development of further non-pay retention measures and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme which I announced on 1 April last, for the re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience represents one of the recent actions being pursued to address the skill shortages in the PDF. It is a medium to long term initiative which pre-dates the COVID crisis, but will support the Defence Forces in responding to, and sustaining their response to, the current COVID-19 crisis and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years and I'm pleased to report that there has been a very positive initial response to the scheme for re-enlistment with over 500 expressions of interest. The focus of the scheme is on those former members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) with the skills and expertise to fill specialist vacancies that currently exist in the PDF. These shortages of personnel include a number of specialised posts such as technicians, fitters, chefs, communications and IT specialist, naval and avionics experts. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, I introduced a scheme for re-commissioning former Officers last October. This scheme facilitates the re-entry of former officers to the Permanent Defence Force and has seen 5 former pilots return to serve in the Air Corps to date. There is also scope to recommission officers in other specialist streams across the Defence Forces and I understand a number of expressions of interest in the scheme have been received recently. <\/p>  <p>   The PDF continues to offer excellent career opportunities for serving personnel, new entrants and those wishing to re-enter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1619"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[4079\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has examined the possibility of extending contracts past 50 years of age for members of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) was an issue of serious concern during the 1990's and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports.  One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  As a result new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years' service.  Since that time, the maximum period of service was extended out to twenty-one years for Privates and Corporals.  <\/p>  <p>  Arising from an adjudication in 2015, the adjudicator recommended that a review be conducted on the service limits for Privates and Corporals recruited to the Defence Forces post 1 January 1994. This adjudication resulted from a claim from PDFORRA seeking extensions in the service of these personnel to age 50. While the adjudicator did not rule in favour of PDFORRA, he did recommend an extension of service limits for Privates and Corporals in receipt of Tech Pay Group 3 or higher pending completion of the review. <\/p>  <p>  This recommended review is now being subsumed into a broader review of service limits for all enlisted personnel, as provided for in the White Paper on Defence and more recently in the \"Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One&rdquo; high level implementation plan (HLIP). The HLIP provides that consideration be given to options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the PDF, including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members of the PDF. Given the complexities involved it was decided to approach the HLIP project in two phases as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Phase 1 &ndash; Review of Mandatory Retirement Ages (MRAs) for Officers <\/p>  <p>  - Phase 2 - Review Contracts of Service for Enlisted Personnel. <\/p>  <p>  The review of MRAs for officers is currently on-going, with the review of contracts of service for enlisted personnel due to commence later in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Pending completion of the review (of contracts of service for enlisted personnel), the service extension for Privates and Corporals, enlisted post 1 January 1994, has been revised, to the end of December 2022, provided the individual meets certain criteria, including medical grades and fitness tests and does not exceed 50 years of age in that time frame. This measure was agreed with PDFORRA. Following further discussions, it was also agreed that  Sergeants enlisted in the PDF would also be allowed continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1619"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[4108\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if a person (details supplied) holds an entitlement to a FCA pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>In general, service in an Forsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, even if full-time, is not reckonable for pension purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  Exceptionally, there is provision for the reckoning of service on full-time security duties in an Forsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il but only in certain limited circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on records held, I regret to advise that the service of the person in question is not eligible under these limited provisions and is therefore not reckonable for pension purposes.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The capital allocation for Defence is &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on National Development Plan 2019 allocation.  The NDP - Project Ireland 2040 - provides financial allocations for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The fourth ship in the programme, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, was commissioned into service in May 2019 reflecting an investment by the Government of over &euro;250 million in the new ships programme since 2010. The four ships are performing well in operational service.  <\/p>  <p>  Along with the L&Eacute; Eithne, the L&Eacute; Ciara was built in 1984, while the L&Eacute; Orla was built in 1985.  Currently the L&Eacute; Orla is in reserve. At the end of 2019 L&Eacute; Ciara underwent a planned annual dry-docking and is again operational.  As a result of the White Paper commitment to vessel replacement, the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the immediate White Paper project in this context.  Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1619"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[5302\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of protected disclosures his Department has received since the legislation was introduced; the number of protected disclosures examined to conclusion by year in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>There have been a total of 26 Protected Disclosures made between 2014 and 2019 with an additional three received to date in 2020.

The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial state bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.  <\/p><p>Pension abatement operates to ensure that pensions payable to public servants do not have the effect of making a pensioner's earnings from their current public service job, plus their existing public service retirement pension, exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. The pension payable may be reduced, that is, abated, to stay within the overall limit. The actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person and in some cases there may be no abatement.<s><\/s><\/p><p>I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle \/ concept already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.  However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the principle across and between all public service sectors generally, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.<\/p><p>I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment<b><\/b>immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post\/position. However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation. <\/p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1619"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[5426\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300088#WRB05700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the strength of the Permanent Defence Forces as of 31 March 2020, by gender across all ranks of the three services in tabular form;

This includes freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture in detention.

Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of our engagement and dialogue with Iran.<\/p>  <p>  Discriminatory practices with respect to employment, education and access to other basic services, continue to affect Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; and other minority groups in Iran. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran has reported on the fact that members of minorities continue to be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention for engaging in peaceful advocacy for their rights in Iran. Changes to the form for acquiring a national ID card in Iran this year, which have now made it impossible for followers of the Baha'i faith to obtain a new national identification card unless they renounce their religion, is deeply worrying. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call strongly for the end to the persecution of members of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; faith in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN. Ireland has consistently raised the discriminatory treatment of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in Iran. Most recently, at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland raised concerns regarding the continued discrimination against members of ethnic and religious minorities, in particular those that are not recognised under the Constitution in Iran. Ireland called on Iran to ensure full respect for its international human rights obligations and take all necessary steps to protect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, and made particular reference to the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community.<\/p>  <p>  Bilaterally, our concerns are conveyed to the Iranian Embassy on all appropriate occasions.

With less than 7 months to the end of transition, we remain committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that citizens and businesses are as ready as they can be for the end of transition.  The Government acted swiftly and decisively in terms of COVID-related supports to businesses.  Brexit preparation will necessarily be part of a wider business recovery agenda and we will look at how best business supports can be deployed in support of Brexit readiness. <\/p>  <p>  Significant challenges arise given the UK will leave the Customs Union and Single Market at the end of the transition period.  Even the best possible FTA between the EU and UK will impact supply chains and trade flows and result in checks and controls in both directions on EU-UK trade.   <\/p>  <p>  Supporting these supply chains and trade flows remains a priority. Significant investment in infrastructure and systems in our ports and airports continues.  The UK landbridge will continue to be of paramount strategic importance to EU operators, especially Irish operators, as a means of accessing the EU Single Market.  We are engaging with our partners in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the Commission to provide a pathway for ensuring the Landbridge remains a viable and efficient option for EU traders.  I have discussed this with Michel Barnier and he understands the importance of safeguarding this important route to market.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s preparedness work will be closely aligned with progress on the negotiations and will evolve as elements of a deal become clearer.  As the talks progress, we will roll out communications programmes covering specific areas.  As before, departments and agencies will continue to meet with key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I hosted a meeting of the Brexit Stakeholders Forum.

It is critical, therefore, that the UK Government give a clear roadmap and begin to put practical operational arrangements in place for its implementation. These must be communicated to economic operators in good time.  The European Commission on 30 April published a technical note on some of the practical steps needed to implement the Protocol.  Ireland has advocated early movement on implementation both in bilateral contacts with the UK and in meetings of the EU-UK Joint Committee and in the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the Protocol will mean some changes. Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs territory but will continue to apply the rules of the Union Customs Code and relevant EU legislation. The Commission has been clear that there will be a need for checks, some of which already exist, on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  It is important that the implementation of the Protocol works for Northern Ireland, and for the all-island economy, in as smooth a manner as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  At the EU-UK Joint Committee, which held its first meeting on 30 March, and the Specialised Committee, which met on 30 April, Ireland participated as part of the EU delegation, while representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive formed part of the UK delegation.

The Specialised Committee took stock of work needed regarding implementation and had an initial discussion on decisions required under the Protocol before the end of transition. Ireland welcomes these important steps.<\/p>  <p>  Clarity on implementation is particularly important to give reassurance and certainty, and the EU will continue to press for this ahead of the next meetings of the Joint and Specialised Committees. <\/p>  <p>  Full implementation of what was agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement is fundamental for all EU Member States.

This is a product, which my officials have previously sought information from the Central Bank on.  In response, the Bank has indicated that it is designed to provide consumers with life cover for their whole life.  As long as the policyholder makes regular payments and the payments are sufficient to maintain the chosen benefits, this type of cover will pay a lump sum on the death of the policyholder.  Regular payments into the plan cover the cost of providing the benefits chosen on the plan. In the early years, the payments are higher than the cost of the policyholder&rsquo;s benefits, with the extra money paid going into the plan fund.  However, protection benefits get more expensive as policyholders get older with the result that payments into the plan begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly, and in order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund.  In order to see if the consumer&rsquo;s regular payment plus any fund which has been built up is enough to cover their chosen benefits for their reviewable protection plan, an insurance company carries out regular reviews of these plans. I understand that the period in which these regular reviews are completed can be five, six, ten or twelve years depending on the product.<\/p><p>During such a review, the insurance company may find that the consumer&rsquo;s current level of payments is enough to maintain the level of cover which the consumer wants.  However, the insurance company may also find that the current level of payments is not enough to maintain the level of cover desired by the consumer, thus explaining why policyholders can find that their premiums are increasing.  I understand it is generally following these reviews, that some people, particularly those that are more elderly, may find that their level of payments are being increased.  This is the nature of this product, and as with any type of insurance product, there is no role for the Department of Finance or the Central Bank in any of these reviews as these are an individual matter for each insurance company and may differ from policy to policy.<\/p><p>I would however encourage any consumer who is dissatisfied with the service they have received by their insurance provider to issue a formal complaint to give the provider a chance to sort out the problem.  The provider should deal with any complaint through its complaint handling process. This is called an internal dispute resolution process (IDR process).  When the provider&rsquo;s IDR process has been completed, a consumer can then complain to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) if they are not satisfied with its final response.  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their financial service provider. <\/p><p>The Deputy will also note that the <i>Financial Services and Pension Ombudsman Act 2017<\/i>was amended to provide for changes to the six year rule in relation to long-term financial products. This means that a person can now make a complaint to the Ombudsman within any of the following limits:<\/p><p>- 6 years from the date of the conduct concerned;<\/p><p>- 3 years from the date on which they became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct concerned; or,<\/p><p>- Where it appears to the Ombudsman that there are reasonable grounds for a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances, the time limit may be extended.  <\/p><p>Finally, I would note that there is an onus within the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for companies to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interest of consumers, to act with due care and diligence, and prohibits firms from misleading customer.  The Central Bank expects that when consumers are sold any product, including unit linked whole-of-life insurance, that the risks in that product are fully explained.  When assessing suitability, a regulated entity must ensure that the product or service is consistent with the consumer&rsquo;s attitude to risk.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to direct insurance companies, through insurance legislation or otherwise, as to the pricing level for whole-of-life insurance policies, as to do so, would be a breach of the EU and Irish legal framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300089#WRC06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300089#WRC06400"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[4007\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300089#WRC06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount expended on access to online and hard copy media publications in each of the years 2017 to 2019 and to date in 2020; the breakdown of online and hard copy subscriptions including the publications that his Department subscribes to; if consideration has been given to using a banded set of IP addresses for online subscriptions rather than individual accounts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>As at the time this question was received the amount my Department incurred in respect of access to online and hardcopy media publications in each of the years 2017 to 2019 and in 2020; and the breakdown of online and hard copy subscriptions including the publications that my Department subscribes to is provided in the table below:<\/p><p>(The majority of subscriptions for the Department are managed centrally by our Facilities Management Unit.

An electric vehicle is one that derives its motive power exclusively from an electric motor. As such, hybrid vehicles do not qualify for this treatment.  The benefit-in-kind exemption applied in respect of an electric car or electric van made available for an employee&rsquo;s private use for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 and applied to both new and used vehicles.<\/p><p>In Finance Act 2018, I extended this favourable tax treatment until 31 December 2021. However, with some exceptions, a cap of &euro;50,000 now applies on the market value of the electric car that qualifies for the full exemption for the years 2019 - 2021.  In effect, an electric car with a market value in excess of &euro;50,000 is subject to the normal benefit-in-kind regime on the excess amount.  In Finance Act 2019, I further extended this measure to 31 December 2022.<\/p><p>Benefit-in-kind is applied to 30% of the original market value of a car. The original market value of a car is the price which it might reasonably have been expected to fetch if sold in the State singly in a retail sale in the open market, immediately before the date of its first registration (in the State or elsewhere). In other words, the original market value is the Irish open market price for a single retail sale immediately before the date on which the car was first registered. For a second-hand car, the original market value is the price of the car when purchased new for the first time. <\/p><p>In the case of an electric car with an original market value in excess of &euro;50,000, the amount subject to benefit-in-kind for the years 2019 &ndash; 2022 is broadly calculated as follows: amount subject to tax = (original market value of the electric car - &euro;50,000) x 30%. <\/p><p>As is the case for all employer-provided cars, if the annual business kilometres travelled exceed 24,000 kilometres, the 30% may be reduced to 24%, 18%, 12% or 6% depending on the amount of business kilometres travelled.

However, as an energy importer Ireland has benefitted from the steep fall in oil prices since 2014, from approximately $100 in 2014 to $64 in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, in recent months, there has been considerable volatility in oil prices, largely arising from geopolitical tensions and the uncertainty surrounding the global economic impact of Covid-19. To date in May 2020, the price of Brent crude oil had decreased by around 60 per cent, to c. $29, since May 2019. Oil prices were expected to fall this year and the current levels are broadly in-line with my Department&rsquo;s most recent economic forecasts published in Stability Programme Update 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Generally speaking, decreases in oil prices should have a positive impact on economy&rsquo;s growth prospects through improving consumer spending power and corporate profitability. All things equal, falling oil prices reduce consumer price inflation resulting in higher real wage growth and higher disposable incomes. My Department is currently forecasting HICP consumer price inflation of -0.6 per cent on the back of falling oil prices and suppressed demand due to Covid-19. Falling oil prices should also result in lower petrol and diesel prices for motoring purposes. However, given the recent developments regarding the spread of coronavirus and the resulting uncertainty surrounding both the domestic and global economy, it is uncertain whether the usual upsides resulting from the fall in oil prices, such as higher consumer spending, will materialise. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, the decision to increase oil supply could easily be reversed resulting in an increase in oil prices. This in turn could result in negative terms of trade effects, with higher import costs reducing purchasing power and in turn weighing on domestic demand. The terms of trade deterioration can also result in a loss of competitiveness for the economy, particularly relative to those trading partners with less reliance on oil.  <\/p>  <p>  While the economy faces the greatest challenge since the financial crisis, the prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position to weather any shock which may materialise including an oil price shock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD03300"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[4291\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the risks facing the economy as a result of the recent falls in stock prices on the Stock Exchange here and globally; the potential impacts on banks here including the capitalisation of the banks and the value of the shareholding of the State in each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[4322\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the relationship, direct or otherwise, between the share price of a bank and the capitalisation of that bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 68 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will know, we are now in the midst of a severe recession, both globally and domestically. Jobs and our people, have borne the brunt of the unprecedented economic decline. But we can and we will recover. Our economy can grow again next year, employment can grow, unemployment can fall, and our public finances can improve. This is because, as the experience of the last financial crisis and Great Recession shows, our economy and labour market are very resilient and have real underlying strengths that this crisis will not have altered.<\/p><p>In fact, none of the imbalances that characterised our economy before the last recession &ndash; unsustainable credit growth, borrowing from abroad through a balance of payments deficit &ndash; are evident at present. <\/p><p>Similarly, the three banks in which the state has a shareholding (AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB) entered this crisis in a good position with strong capital and liquidity positions &ndash; a stark contrast to the previous recession. There are now significant capital and liquidity buffers in place in Irish banks which puts them in a strong position to continue to lend to the economy and to aid the recovery.<\/p><p>Both myself and my officials have engaged and will continue to engage extensively with the Banking and Payments Federation (BPFI) and the banks directly in relation to supports for personal and business customers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Officials in the department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. <\/p><p>All the banks have continued to evolve and expand the supports they have available and I would expect that this process continues. Consequently given the size of the economic shock and the uncertainty around the short to medium term outlook, management teams across every bank in Europe are withdrawing previously issued guidance on earnings for the year and setting out new plans. Our banks are no different.<\/p><p>In regard to the value of the State's shareholdings, we have obviously seen a large drop as share prices everywhere have fallen. However it should also be noted that Irish bank share prices have been under-performing for at least 18 months i.e. before the onset of the current COVID-19 health and economic crisis. <\/p><p>It is therefore clear that in these challenging times, recovering all of the &euro;29bn that the state invested in the three remaining banks is not realistic in the short term and perhaps not the medium term either. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>AIB <\/th>       <th>AIB <\/th>       <th>Bank of Ireland <\/th>       <th>Bank of Ireland <\/th>       <th>PTSB <\/th>       <th>PTSB <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Date <\/td>       <td>Share Price <\/td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (c. 71% of total shares following IPO) <\/td>       <td>Share Price <\/td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (C. 14% of total shares) <\/td>       <td>Share Price <\/td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (c. 75% of total shares) <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>08\/05\/2020 <\/td>       <td>1.085 <\/td>       <td>2094.52 <\/td>       <td>1.644 <\/td>       <td>247.28 <\/td>       <td>0.48 <\/td>       <td>163.52 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>With regard to the factors influencing the shares since the current crisis began, I have been informed that feedback from investors and analysts identifies a few likely contributing factors:<blockquote>1.  The large state shareholding: Feedback from investors and advisory firms indicates market concern that banks across Europe with a large state shareholding could be subject to political pressures. Therefore there is some correlation between share price performance and state shareholdings. In Ireland's case we have legally binding Relationship Frameworks which ensure that commercial decisions are matters for the board and management of the banks in which we have a shareholding. <br \/><br \/>2.  A low level of trading volumes: in the current turbulent environment investors have a preference for highly liquid stocks that they can trade in and out of rapidly.  <\/blockquote>These factors likely explain why there is such an apparent lack of correlation between the share price of Irish banks and their strong capital positions relative to their peers around Europe.<\/p><p>As regards the fall in the Irish and international stock markets more generally, aside from the knock on wealth and confidence effects, it will likely be more difficult and expensive for some companies to raise equity finance in the months ahead. This is why it is so important that our banking system support its customers appropriately so we can all navigate the current crisis successfully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[4292\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value of the shareholding of the State in each of the State-supported banks since 2016 in six month intervals and in the case of a bank (details supplied) including the last sale of shares to the market in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>AIB <\/th>       <th>AIB <\/th>       <th>Bank of Ireland <\/th>       <th>Bank of Ireland <\/th>       <th>PTSB <\/th>       <th>PTSB <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Date <\/td>       <td>Share Price <\/td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (c. 71% of total shares following IPO) <\/td>       <td>Share Price <\/td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (C. 14% of total shares) <\/td>       <td>Share Price <\/td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (c. 75% of total shares) <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>08\/05\/2020 <\/td>       <td>1.085 <\/td>       <td>2094<\/td>       <td>1.64<\/td>       <td>247 <\/td>       <td>0.48 <\/td>       <td>163.5 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>02\/01\/2020 <\/td>       <td>3.216 <\/td>       <td>6208<\/td>       <td>5.01<\/td>       <td>754 <\/td>       <td>1.12 <\/td>       <td>381.5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>03\/06\/2019 <\/td>       <td>3.664 <\/td>       <td>7073<\/td>       <td>4.74<\/td>       <td>713 <\/td>       <td>1.35 <\/td>       <td>459.9 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>02\/01\/2019 <\/td>       <td>3.644 <\/td>       <td>7034<\/td>       <td>4.87<\/td>       <td>733<\/td>       <td>1.66 <\/td>       <td>565.5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>01\/06\/2018 <\/td>       <td>4.85 <\/td>       <td>9362<\/td>       <td>7.26 <\/td>       <td>1092<\/td>       <td>1.79 <\/td>       <td>609.8 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>02\/01\/2018 <\/td>       <td>5.46 <\/td>       <td>10540<\/td>       <td>7.19 <\/td>       <td>1082<\/td>       <td>2.28 <\/td>       <td>776.7 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>01\/06\/2017 <\/td>       <td>n\/a* <\/td>       <td>n\/a* <\/td>       <td>7.20 <\/td>       <td>1083 <\/td>       <td>2.80 <\/td>       <td>953.8 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>03\/01\/2017 <\/td>       <td>n\/a* <\/td>       <td>n\/a* <\/td>       <td>7.50 <\/td>       <td>1128 <\/td>       <td>2.81<\/td>       <td>959.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>01\/06\/2016 <\/td>       <td>n\/a* <\/td>       <td>n\/a* <\/td>       <td>7.83 <\/td>       <td>1177<\/td>       <td>2.09<\/td>       <td>712.3 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>* AIB only returned to the Dublin and London stock exchanges on 23 June 2017 following IPO. <\/p><p>The last sale of shares in AIB took place during the IPO in late June, 2017.

Section 31 of Finance Act 2014 repealed the 80% tax rate on these profits or gains with effect from 1 January 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I have signalled in the past my concerns regarding the re-introduction of a windfall tax. These were on the basis that the re-introduction of a windfall tax on a similar basis is likely to act as a disincentive to landowners to dispose of such property. In addition, the existence of the levy may discourage landowners from seeking planning permission for specific sites. Currently most sales of land or property are subject to CGT at 33 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  1)  The extent to which any windfall tax may affect land hoarding, land development or indeed residential house prices is likely to be determined by its design, its scale, scope and the rate applied. In the absence of such detail it would be difficult to comment on its potential impact. Indeed if such a tax was introduced it would be some time before it would be possible to consider its effectiveness or impact. <\/p>  <p>  (1)  As regards capturing any increased land value from rezoning, it is understood that such measures can be a combination of either specific taxes or fees, levies or charges which could be used for specific development purposes. There are also forms of development based land value capture, which aims to capture revenues from the development of the land and return the benefit to state or local authorities. As with any consideration of windfall levies if such or indeed other measures were to be implemented to capture increased land value from rezoning they would need careful analysis in their development, design and implementation. <\/p>  <p>  It is not clear as to the policy basis a windfall tax would be introduced only for industrial sites identified in Dublin City Council and South Dublin City Counsel. The advice of the Attorney General on the constitutionality of a windfall tax based on geographic location would be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  (1)  The introduction of any tax changes by themselves such as a windfall tax would not be the solution to resolving issues with the housing market and the supply of new homes. There is significant past experience, which suggests that tax changes by themselves have the potential to create distortions, create perverse incentives and may not lead to a desired outcome of increasing the supply of residential property. <\/p>  <p>  Finally I would point to the operation of the Land Development Agency (LDA). One of the key aims of the agency is to drive strategic land assembly for the long-term by introducing new mechanisms for working with both public and private sector land owners, by stabilizing land values, flattening extreme peaks and troughs and driving increased affordability through better land availability. The LDA will, in effect, be the State&rsquo;s tool for actively managing development land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[4470\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the taxes levied on the pension of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it was informed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) that the person&rsquo;s State Contributory Pension payment increased by &euro;5 per week with effect from 6 January 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In situations where a person has both a private pension and a State Contributory Pension from DEASP, the tax due on the latter (DEASP payment) is achieved by reducing the annual tax credits on the former (private pension) by the value of the DEASP payment.<\/p>  <p>  For example, an increase of &euro;5 per week in a DEASP payment means that tax on an additional &euro;260 is to be collected over the course of the year by reducing a person&rsquo;s tax credits.  &euro;260 extra income at the standard rate of tax of 20% gives rise to a reduction in tax credits of &euro;52 for the year or &euro;4.34 per month. <\/p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s private pension provider applied the revised tax credits and rate band to the private pension payment of 1 March 2020 and, consequently, additional income tax was deducted on a cumulative basis back to the beginning of 2020. <\/p>  <p>  While reviewing the person&rsquo;s overall tax position, it was noted by Revenue, based on available information, that the person had not received his full credit entitlements.

Regulated entities will now make available a further three-month extension to the current payment moratoria to customers that continue to be directly impacted by the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank) that it continues to engage with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and with firms themselves to ensure the effective implementation of these payment breaks. Credit unions are also supporting requests from their members, on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank expects all regulated entities to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests. Any customer facing potential difficulties in making loan repayments as a result of COVID-19, is advised to contact their bank, credit union or credit servicer as early as possible. The existing protections of the consumer protection framework continue to apply as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection framework seeks to ensure that regulated entities are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle. Provision 3.1 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the CPC) requires that where a regulated entity has identified that a personal consumer is a vulnerable consumer, the regulated entity must ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements and\/or assistance that may be necessary to facilitate him or her in his or her dealings with the regulated entity. This includes particular vulnerabilities that may arise as a result of the impact of COVID-19, for example, illness or loss of income.<\/p>  <p>  Provision 2.6 of the CPC requires that regulated entities must make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer. As such, where a payment moratorium is offered in respect of the Covid-19 situation, the Central Bank expects that firms will make clear to the borrower how the moratorium works, the impact of the moratorium on the overall cost of the mortgage and future repayments, as well as how the borrower will be treated when the arrangement ends.<\/p>  <p>  If a payment moratorium has been mutually agreed between the borrower and the lender, then the loan will not be considered to be in arrears in respect of payments not made over the duration of the agreed payment moratorium.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is acutely aware that dealing with the challenges of COVID-19 will require a co-ordinated effort across the public and private sectors.  First and foremost, COVID-19 is a global public health emergency, so the front line of Ireland&rsquo;s response comprises of the exceptional efforts of Ireland&rsquo;s health professionals.  But it is also clear that COVID-19 is disrupting economic activity, both internationally and in Ireland, with adverse implications for the financial position of households and businesses in the near term.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Central Bank's mission to serve the public interest by safeguarding stability and ensuring that the financial system is operating in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy, the Central Bank expects firms to take a consumer-focused approach at this worrying time for some of its customers.<\/p>  <p>  European Central Bank (ECB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines prescribe the conditions under which a loan is considered to be non-performing for banks. Lenders are also obliged to comply with relevant accounting standards. A number of recent statements from the ECB and the EBA clarifies a number of aspects of the prudential framework to provide clarity to the EU Banking sector.  Where flexibility is provided for within the various obligations, the Central Bank will consider the application of this within the broader European framework. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Banks has stated that where the Central Credit Register (CCR) is concerned, lenders obligations continue under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 to submit accurate information, and to enquire on the CCR when considering loan applications for &euro;2,000 or more.  Lenders may also enquire on the CCR when considering a loan for less than &euro;2,000; if a borrower has requested a restructure on an existing loan; if there are arrears on an existing loan or if there has been a breach of the limit of a credit card or overdraft.  Borrowers can request their credit report at any time, free of charge (subject to fair usage), at centralcreditregister.ie.<\/p>  <p>   The CCR produces credit reports for lenders and borrowers on request. The CCR does not produce a credit score; it simply records the information that is submitted by lenders on a monthly basis.  It is factual impartial information. The CCR does not decide if a loan is approved, the lender does.<\/p>  <p>  Any payment arrangements (including payment breaks agreed between a borrower and their lender) are a matter for discussion between these two parties. Lenders must ensure that they accurately reflect changes to a borrower&rsquo;s repayment terms, in the data submitted to the CCR in accordance with the guidance issued by the Central Bank.  When a lender agrees a payment break with a borrower, the lender should not report this to the CCR as being &ldquo;missed&rdquo; or &ldquo;past due&rdquo; or the loan as being &ldquo;restructured&rdquo; during the period of the payment break.<\/p>  <p>  Borrowers may also avail of the option to place an explanatory statement on their credit report in connection with any of their information on their credit report.  So for example, if a borrower found themselves in arrears on a loan, they could use this option to explain the circumstances, if they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD06600"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[4524\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he will take to prevent the closure of a project (details supplied) in Dublin 24.","asker":"1569","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>Let me say at the outset that I am very aware of the affordability and availability of insurance cover issues facing local community groups and projects, such as the one outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  I have much sympathy for the position such groups find themselves in, however as the Deputy is aware, there are significant constraints on what the Government can do to immediately resolve this issue.  <\/p><p>In this regard, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to community groups, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding these constraints, insurance reform remains a priority. The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers, businesses and the voluntary\/community and arts sectors.  The CIWG has produced two reports: the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>and the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance<\/i>.<\/p><p>Many reforms have been made already, including amendments to the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>, the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003<\/i>, and the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is clear however that the single biggest challenge that still needs to be addressed and which is having the most impact on the community group sector is the level of awards that exist in Ireland, for relatively minor injuries, as compared to other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>I believe the key recommendation arising from both of the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.  The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales.  On foot of the PIC recommendations, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>.  <\/p><p>This Act provides that the Judicial Council nominate a date for establishment of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee at its first meeting in accordance with Section 18 of the Judicial Council Act 2019.  At that meeting on 7 February 2020, the Council nominated 28 April 2020 for the establishment of the Committee.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the first meeting of the Committee will take place within one month of establishment and the draft guidelines will be prepared within six months of establishment for submission to the Judicial Council.  It should be noted that adherence to this timeline is a responsibility for the Judicial Council itself and my Department has no role in the matter.  Further, while the Government cannot interfere in the Judicial Council&rsquo;s deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, I would hope that the Guidelines will take into account the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, and can come into operation as soon as possible following their submission to the Judicial Council.  In return for lower and more consistent award levels, I believe insurers should significantly reduce their premium levels and broaden their risk horizons.<\/p><p>In summary, the key outstanding challenge to satisfactorily resolve the cost and availability of insurance issue is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  I believe if this is done and these awards are applied consistently by the courts, the current problems being experienced by impacted community groups and projects, as well as other businesses and organisations more generally, will recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Increases","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD06900"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[4533\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300090#WRD07000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider overturning the decision made by the Revenue Commissioners to introduce VAT increases on food supplements, particularly those which are used by persons to slow down the deterioration of their sight; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils).

It should be noted that the transitional CET1 ratio is the ratio which the regulator uses when assessing compliance with the minimum ratio set for the bank.<\/p><p>In the Technical Note referred to above, it was estimated that the removal of DTAs from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets would have the following impact on the December 2017 CET1 ratios as follows:<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Transitional CET1 <\/th>       <th>AIB <\/th>       <th>BOI <\/th>       <th>PTSB <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ratio as reported <\/td>       <td>20.8% <\/td>       <td>15.8% <\/td>       <td>17.1% <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Pro-forma ratios with DTAs removed<\/td>       <td>17.1% <\/td>       <td>14.0% <\/td>       <td>14.8% <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Reduction in CET1 ratios <\/td>       <td>(3.7%) <\/td>       <td>(1.8%) <\/td>       <td>(2.3%) <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>As fully loaded CET1 ratios are calculated with the DTAs deducted in their entirety from regulatory capital, the removal of DTAs would not impact on the reported ratio in the reporting period in which they were removed. However, for subsequent reporting periods, fully loaded ratios would be negatively impacted as they would not have benefited from the usage of the DTAs in the scenario where the banks continue to be profitable. This also applies beyond the transitional period.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the significant increase in regulatory capital which the banks are now required to hold since the financial crisis. It is not possible to estimate the potential reaction of the regulator should the DTAs be removed from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets in terms of addressing the impact of this on capital. However, as the impact would be significant, with the reported ratios at AIB, BOI and PTSB being reduced by an estimated 18%, 11% and 13% respectively using the same data, it would no doubt be a matter carefully considered.<\/p><p>In terms of valuation,  it is important to highlight that the DTAs are a valuable asset on a bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and the State benefits from this as it sells down its stakes in the banks. The original Technical Note estimated that the value of the DTAs, under current rules and on a discounted cash flow basis, was c. &euro;2.28bn with the State&rsquo;s share being c. &euro;1.22bn (54%) reflecting its relative shareholdings in the banks.<\/p><p>As a separate matter,  the removal of DTAs would likely have an impact on the pricing of retail customer products. Although its difficult to estimate the precise impact, one of the key criteria used by banks when pricing products is the return on equity (ROE). ROE is an important metric for a number of stakeholders including the regulator, when assessing the financial performance of a bank. Accordingly, should a bank be required to hold more capital arising from the removal of DTAs, this could put upward pressure on interest rates say, for example, in relation to loan products to ensure the bank is achieving an adequate ROE.<\/p><p>Finally, during the Committee Stage of Finance Bill 2019, I committed to providing the FinPERT Committee with updated figures on the Technical Note provided in August 2018. Although the figures had changed somewhat allowing for a further year&rsquo;s data, the keys messages from the original Technical Note remain unchanged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[4763\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the rate of VAT (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1569","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I am advised that information regarding the potential impact of possible rate changes on VAT receipts is available in Revenue&rsquo;s Ready Reckoner at link:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Increases or decreases in excess of the listed 1% change can be extrapolated on a straight-line basis. <\/p><p>Please note that the Ready Reckoner does not account for COVID-19. <\/p><p>Under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, the lowest standard rate that can apply is 15%.

It is clear that the pandemic is disrupting economic activity, both internationally and in Ireland, with adverse impacts on households, businesses and the financial system in the near term. The necessary containment measures on public health grounds will have a significant impact on the euro area and Irish economies. <\/p><p><b>Monetary policy actions<\/b><\/p><p>The European Central Bank has taken a series of monetary policy measures, with the following measures announced at the Governing Council meeting of 12 March 2020:<\/p><p>1.Additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs);<\/p><p>2.More favourable terms on the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs);<\/p><p>3.Additional net asset purchases under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP).<\/p><p>The ECB&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 outbreak was further strengthened on 18 March by:<\/p><p>1.A new temporary asset purchase programme announced (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme or PEPP);<\/p><p>2.Eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) broadened to include non-financial commercial paper of sufficient credit quality;<\/p><p>3.Eligible collateral with respect to refinancing operations expanded to include claims related to the financing of the corporate sector under Additional Credit Claims (ACC). <\/p><p>The Central Bank recently published an Economic Letter that describes the above monetary policy actions taken to combat the crisis, in particular liquidity policies and asset purchases, and outlines what these measures mean for Ireland<\/p><p>(See Holton, Phelan and Stuart, 2020, ). <\/p><p>Further to these measures, on 7 April the Governing Council of the ECB announced a number of temporary collateral easing measures. The goal of these measures is to facilitate the availability of eligible collateral for banks to allow the banks better access to liquidity operations.<\/p><p>On 30 April, the Governing Council announced further changes to the TLTRO programme with the entry interest rate being lowered to 50 basis points below the average Main Refinancing Operation (MRO) rate over the life of the operation.  The Governing Council also announced a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). The goals of these operations are to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system. <\/p><p><b>Macroprudential and Supervisory policy actions<\/b><\/p><p>European and national policy on capital and liquidity buffers has also been designed to allow banks to withstand stressed situations like the current one. <\/p><p>On 18 March, the Central Bank of Ireland announced that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, which had been set at 1 per cent effective from July 2019, would be fully released and reduced to 0 per cent. The release of this time-varying capital buffer is appropriate in the current circumstances in-line with its underlying rationale to support the sustainable flow of credit to the economy in both good times and bad.  This action will support the continued provision of credit to households and business by the banking system during this challenging time.  <\/p><p>The Supervisory Board of the ECB announced on 12 March that it will allow banks to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).<\/p><p>Banks will also be allowed to partially use capital instruments that do not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, for example Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments, to meet the Pillar 2 Requirements (P2R). This brings forward a measure that was initially scheduled to come into effect in January 2021, as part of the latest revision of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V).<\/p><p>In subsequent decisions, the Supervisory Board issued a recommendation that banks in the euro area not issue dividends with respect to 2019 or 2020 before October 2020 at the earliest, and there was further capital relief provided with respect to market risk.<\/p><p>The Central Bank recently published a Financial Stability Note outlining the rationale underlying the release of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) in Ireland in the light of the recent COVID-19 developments<\/p><p>(See De Nora, O'Brien and O'Brien, 2020,<i>).<\/i><\/p><p>As Minister for Finance, I expect banks to use the positive effects of these measures to support the economy and I know that the Central Bank of Ireland shares this view.

The background to this decision was a series of meetings with the major insurers where significant concerns were expressed about the early implementation of particular sections of the Act (Sections, 8 and 12), and a general view that they needed a number of months to prepare themselves for the implementation of the other provisions.<\/p>  <p>  My decision was made on the premise that the majority of the Act could be made operational from an early date after the new Government was formed. This assumption was made on there being a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; approach in the broader economy.  However, circumstances have changed very dramatically with the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19.  This change of circumstances, in my view, needs to feature in any decision in relation to the commencement of this Act by the new Government.  <\/p>  <p>  What I can say however is that in my meetings with insurers, they outlined their need for sufficient time in relation to the implementation of Sections 8 (Pre&ndash;contractual duties of consumer and insurer) and Section 12 (Renewal of contract of insurance). You should also note that, Sections 9 (Proportionate remedies for misrepresentation) and 14 (Duties of consumer and insurer at renewal) are sufficiently interrelated with Section 8 that their concerns also apply to these sections.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, my officials have advised me that the sector has have indicated to them that if insurers are not provided with sufficient time to implement the requirements necessary to fulfil the obligations of the above mentioned sections, insurers may be forced to withdraw certain products from the market in order to prioritise others so as to ensure that they are fully compliant with the law. Such a withdrawal is most likely to impact the employer\/public liability part of the market.

Moneylenders should seek to implement alternative repayment methods, if possible, during this time. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland (Central Bank) is responsible for the licensing and supervision of licensed moneylenders under the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (CCA).  I am advised by the Central Bank that there is a strong framework of protection in place for consumers who choose to avail of the services of licensed moneylenders.  The provisions of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations, 2010 (the CCR) set out certain additional requirements in relation to advertising and the content of relevant documentation (contractual and pre-contractual) to accompany certain credit agreements including moneylending agreements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders (ML Code) also applies to licensed moneylenders engaged in the business of moneylending. <\/p>  <p>  The relevant statutory and regulatory provisions in relation to advertising by licensed moneylenders are set out in the CCR and the ML Code. Regulation 7 of the CCR sets out that where an advertisement contains a reference to an interest rate or any figure relating to the cost of credit to the consumer that other standard information shall be included in a clear, concise and prominent way by means of a representative example. As set out in the ML Code, licensed moneylenders are required to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of the consumer and the integrity of the market. The ML Code also requires all advertisements to be fair and not misleading. At all times advertising must be in the best interests of consumers and compliant with Codes and Regulations.  The Central Bank is continuing to work towards the publication of the revised ML Code in the form of Statutory Regulations, which it expects to issue shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the protections provided under the Central Bank&rsquo;s ML Code, there are also important protections provided for in the relevant legislation whereby licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges (other than a collection charge) to a moneylending agreement and are also prohibited from applying any additional charges in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement (i.e., the total amount repayable by a consumer is limited to the amount specified in the moneylending agreement (the only exception being the awarding of legal costs by a Court of law)).  Licensed moneylenders are also required to undertake a creditworthiness assessment before entering into a moneylending agreement with a consumer.  The Central Bank has previously highlighted its expectation to all credit providers, including licensed moneylenders that they lend responsibly and act in the best interests of consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Given the potentially increased vulnerability of the consumer base who typically engage with licensed moneylenders and the high cost nature of moneylending loans, the Central Bank expects licensed moneylenders to conduct their activities in a manner which reflects a culture of responsibility at all times. The Central Bank actively communicates to moneylenders in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Licensed moneylenders need to be sensitive to changes in consumers&rsquo; circumstances due to the public health measures taken to counter the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which have left many in a financially vulnerable situation.  The Central Bank expects licensed moneylenders to take account of the difficult and challenging situation in which many consumers find themselves and to take a consumer-focused approach in providing reasonable arrangements and\/or assistance to support consumers affected by the COVID-19 situation at this difficult time.  Licensed moneylenders who continue to issue loans to consumers must ensure they carry out adequate affordability assessments, particularly taking into account any financial difficulties faced by consumers as a result of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  People experiencing financial difficulties should explore all the options available to them before applying for a loan. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is available to anyone experiencing problems with budgeting and debt. Furthermore, Government has introduced a range of supports to help people where their employment or salary has been impacted by COVID-19, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme.  These measures should also assist those in difficulty and hopefully negate the need to borrow, particularly at high interest rates.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the issue of moneylender interest rates is currently being examined by the Department of Finance. The Department undertook a public consultation in 2019 seeking views on capping the cost of licensed moneylenders and other regulatory matters in relation to moneylending. Analysis of the submissions received during the consultation is being used in framing of policy proposals by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Levy","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE05700"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[5212\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding levies on ESB pensions; if his attention has been drawn to the duration that this levy is applied to recipients and a surviving spouse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[5216\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE05900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the pension levy introduced in 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.<\/p>  <p>The pension fund levy was introduced in 2011 in the wake of the financial crash and at a time when the economy was in serious difficulties. Urgent action needed to be taken to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.  <\/p>  <p>  For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. <\/p>  <p>  However, the legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it had to be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits. <\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies has been used to protect and create jobs and this helped to improve the financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will have since benefitted from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Sector","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06200"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[5286\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the correspondence he has had with an organisation (details supplied) regarding the application of additional interest on mortgage loans by banks and non-banks in circumstances in which the mortgage holder has availed of a three month mortgage break as a result of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[5287\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the correspondence he has had with the five retail banks regarding the application of additional interest on mortgage loans by banks and non-banks in circumstances in which the mortgage holder has availed of a three month mortgage break as a result of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[5288\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the correspondence he has had with the Central Bank regarding the application of additional interest on mortgage loans by banks and non-banks in circumstances in which the mortgage-holder has availed of a three month mortgage break as a result of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[5289\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the correspondence he has had with a bank (details supplied) regarding the application of additional interest on mortgage loans in circumstances in which the mortgage holder has availed of a three month mortgage break as a result of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 to 100, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>On 18 March last I met with Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and the CEOs of the five main retail banks, and following that meeting the banks outlined a coordinated approach, which included payment breaks on mortgages and other loans, to supporting their personal and business customers who have been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  Since then, my Department has kept in contact with the BPFI and certain lenders in relation to the impact of Covid-19, and of course my Department always maintains close and regular contact with the Central Bank on all matters of mutual interest.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the economic difficulties and issues associated with Covid-19 continue to evolve and the recent statement by the BPFI (on 30 April), which stated that the period of loan payment breaks will increase to six months, is testament to this.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has advised that it continue<s>s<\/s>to work with lenders to ensure the fair treatment of customers who find themselves in financial difficulties due to the exceptional circumstances of Covid-19.  Payment breaks give borrowers affected by Covid-19 the opportunity to postpone or substantially reduce their repayments at a time of stress.  It is clear that these payment breaks are necessary for many borrowers to enable them to deal with the immediate<s><\/s>shock that they are experiencing.  The Central Bank expects lenders to clearly explain to their customers the implications of a payment break, for the term, payment schedule and costs of the loan. This includes clarity on how the term of the mortgage will extend, and \/ or whether the payment break will require increased monthly payments in the future once the break expires. <\/p><p>Across the European Union, non-performing loans are classified according to a common set of rules under the accounting and banking regulations. Changes to interest charging can, under these rules, result in forbearance implications and in loans becoming classified as in default under distressed restructuring, with consequences for both consumers and banks. The Central Bank has engaged extensively with its counterparts across the EU (in the European Banking Authority and as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) to ensure that the non-legislative payment breaks applied in Ireland avoid the classification of exposures under the definition of forbearance or as defaulted under distressed restructuring, where appropriate. In this context, the recently published EBA Guidelines (see )  provide clarity on the treatment of payment moratoria and in particular that payment moratoria do not trigger classification as forbearance or distressed restructuring if the measures taken meet certain conditions. <\/p><p>As you will be aware, An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys and I met with the Chief Executives of the five Irish major retail banks earlier this week.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach emphasised the important role of the banking sector in supporting the gradual re-opening of the Irish economy by ensuring a flow of credit to businesses as they begin to trade again, in line with the government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business.<\/p><p>We welcomed the ongoing work of the banks in helping business customers and mortgage customers impacted by COVID-19, the initial three month payment-breaks, allowing households and businesses to defer some of their most significant outgoings and their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for households and businesses.<\/p><p>Finally, we welcomed the commitment by the banks to continue to play their part by working positively with their customers, in as supportive a manner as possible, to ensure that the recovery can take place as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>We will continue to have ongoing engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland, the BPFI and the retail banks on a wide range of issues as we emerge from this crisis, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300091#WRE06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[5290\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the correspondence he has had with a bank (details supplied) regarding its refusal to offer full three month mortgage breaks for mortgage holders who are in mortgage arrears but have lost income as a result of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the BPFI announced late last month over 65,000 mortgage payment breaks had been granted since the cross-bank initiative was introduced.

This is a very broad category of information and I expect that in many cases disclosures falling into this category are received and dealt with properly without the person making the disclosure or those receiving it ever adverting to the fact that the information constitutes a protected disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  It is also generally irrelevant to the manner in which such information is dealt with whether the disclosure concerned falls within the legal definition of a protected disclosure, since the obligations which arise in respect of protected disclosures consist principally of not penalising the discloser for making the disclosure and protecting the identity of the person making the disclosure in some circumstances. These obligations would be routinely met without the need for any legal obligation to compel this to occur, so that it is generally not relevant whether the information constitutes a protected disclosure within the meaning of the legislation or not. It is therefore impossible to be certain that no disclosures which fall within the definition of protected disclosures but which have not been formally identified as such have been received and in fact it is very likely that this has occurred.  <\/p>  <p>  It is for these reasons that it is not possible to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive response to the Deputy's question.  Having said that, it is important to state that the Department of Finance has put in place policy and procedures for the making of Protected Disclosures in the Department, which have been developed in line with the Protected Disclosures Act, 2014 and agreed by the Department&rsquo;s Executive Board. This sets out the process by which a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; of the Department can make a protected disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made and what the Department will do to protect the discloser. <\/p>  <p>  The process supports the Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring that the culture and working environment of the Department encourage, facilitate and support any member of staff of the Department in &lsquo;speaking up&rsquo; on any issue that may impact adversely on the Department&rsquo;s ability to properly and fully carry out all its roles and responsibilities to the high performance standard required. Two alternative confidential recipients have been nominated to receive protected disclosures from internal staff, in the event that a staff member does not wish to make the disclosure to their line manager or the normal senior management team. These nominees are the Head of Legal and the Head of Compliance. To date, neither of these officers have received such an internal protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act requires the publication of a report in respect of protected disclosures received in the preceding year setting out certain information in respect of protected disclosures received. For the purposes of complying with Section 22, the Department publishes informatoin regarding Protected Disclosures formally identified as such, without identifying the person making the disclosure.  Previous reports indicate that one protected disclosure was received in 2017 and one in 2018. One protected disclosure received during 2019 will be included in the report to be published by June of this year. That disclosure remains under active investigation and correspondence with the discloser is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[5425\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason paramedics and EMTs are unable to claim flat rate expenses towards uniforms and other expenses incurred in carrying out their duties as is the case for a wide range of occupations, such as firefighters, doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, physiotherapists and so on; if paramedics and EMTs will be included on the list for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>The flat rate expense (FRE) regime is operated by Revenue on an administrative basis where both a specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 is satisfied, namely, that the expenses are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment by the employee concerned and that such expenses are not reimbursed by his or her employer. <\/p>  <p>  The FRE regime was established to apply a uniformity of approach to tax deductibility for expenses of large groups of employees and to facilitate ease of administration for both Revenue and employees.

Instead of a larger increase in any one year, the Government committed to a &euro;6 increase as a first step towards the 2030 target. In order to ease in the increase I decided to delay the commencement of the increase for marked gas oil and home heating fuels until 1 May 2020, a time of the year when home heating requirements are low.  <\/p><p>In Budget 2020, I also made provision for ringfencing all additional revenue arising from carbon tax increases. At this point it was estimated that the &euro;6 increase would provide additional revenue of some &euro;90 million in 2020 which has been allocated for expenditure on measures related to climate action, protecting the vulnerable and the Just Transition. Some &euro;34 million was allocated to protecting those most vulnerable to fuel poverty by increasing the national fuel allowance payment and providing increased funding for energy efficiency upgrades. <\/p><p>Analysis conducted by the Department of Finance (<i><i>A distributional analysis of Budget 2020 Tax and Welfare measures<\/i><\/i>) using the ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model, confirms that households in the bottom three income deciles will experience a net positive impact in their equivalised disposable income as a result of the changes introduced in Budget 2020 when account is taken of the increase in carbon tax, the increase in fuel allowance and the range of other welfare measures announced. In particular, the analysis finds that any regressive impact of the carbon tax is outweighed by the increase in social welfare transfers and direct tax measures, even before the fuller benefits of the announced carbon tax revenue recycling are accounted for.<\/p><p>Further, whereas the carbon tax increase for home heating fuels applies from 1 May 2020, the increase of &euro;2 per week in the national fuel allowance applied from 6 January 2020. In order to ensure the most vulnerable groups are provided with additional targeted financial supports in a timely and efficient manner, Minister Doherty and I recently announced that the term of this scheme is to be extended by 4 weeks until 8 May (as a one-off measure).  I am acutely aware of the financial uncertainty and strain that many households and businesses are facing as a result of the restrictions in place to limit the spread of Covid19.In order to alleviate this pressure the Government implemented a series of supports including emergency welfare payments, a wage subsidy scheme as well as a major expansion of supports in liquidity measures for businesses affected by Covid19.<\/p><p>As I have outlined, the impact of the carbon tax increase on a typical fuel bundle is moderate and financial supports are in place to protect those most exposed to fuel poverty as well as businesses who are impacted by Covid19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[5485\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300092#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are vacancies in the offices of his Department at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department of Finance does not have any offices in Counties Longford or Westmeath.

It was not introduced in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) 2012 Act (the 2012 Act) but rather it is a principle that dates back to the Superannuation Act of 1834.<\/p>  <p>  With the introduction of the 2012 Act the application of abatement was widened.  Previously, abatement generally applied only where the pensioner returned to work in the same sector or scheme from which the pension was drawn.  As a result, the policy of abatement was not consistent in its application across sectors.  Following the introduction of the Act, the principle of abatement is now  applicable in respect of any public service employment obtained by a public service pensioner. <\/p>  <p>  Sections 52(1) to 52(5) of the 2012 Act provides for the abatement of a public service pension where a retired public servant, whose pension is in payment, is re-employed in the public service such that no more of the pension when combined with the remuneration in the new job shall exceed the pensionable remuneration of the old job. Once a public service pensioner ceases to be employed in the public service their pension ceases to be abated. <\/p>  <p>  The individual Pension Paying Authorities across the various sectors of the Public Service are responsible for ensuring that pension abatement is correctly calculated, processed and applied to pension payments as required. Information regarding the financial effects arising from the implementation of abatement is not routinely reported centrally as a matter of course.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the measures taken in the 2012 Act were progressive, fair and necessary. The extension of abatement across the public service was appropriate as a modernising pension reform, and abatement continues to represent a suitable and measured response to legitimate public concerns about simultaneous payment of both a valuable pension and a salary to individuals working in the public service.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that in recent years some Public Service bodies have experienced retention issues in respect of experienced personnel.  If retired individuals could return to work without being abated it could create incentives for more experienced staff to retire on pension and return to the public service workforce.  In general retired staff should be used to fill posts in very limited circumstances and on a short-term basis only with policy directed toward filling posts through normal recruitment wherever possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300094#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300094#WRK03300"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[5106\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300094#WRK03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the current status of conciliation under way in respect of the new Kevin Street Garda station and Galway Garda station; the costs incurred to date as a result of the conciliation processes; if other Garda buildings projects are in conciliation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>The conciliation process for Kevin Street Garda Station is not yet concluded.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-tome equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e. Some 199 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000. The filling of the remaining posts is being actively pursued by my Department in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. <\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300095#WRM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300095#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[4041\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300095#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the number of pupils rural schools need to have to retain or gain additional teachers will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>Budget 2020 has provided for improved teacher staffing levels for small schools.

The school transport scheme is a demand-led service based on the number of eligible children who apply to avail of transport.  Reimbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost recovery basis on the costs associated with the School transport Scheme. <\/p><p>The Department works with Bus &Eacute;ireann to analyse costs to the scheme on an on-going basis and each year the company produces an audited statement of account.  This ensures that the financial information provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann is in accordance with the relevant summary of accounting arrangements. Actual expenditure is finalised in the Bus &Eacute;ireann annual statement of account which is independently audited by the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors in accordance with the 1975 <i>Summary of Accounting Arrangements<\/i>.  Balances, where they occur, are accounted for in the following year&rsquo;s projected cost. <\/p><p>The nature of the arrangements with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the School Transport Scheme involves the Company recovering direct and indirect costs. These costs are referred to as the Transport Management Charge (TMC). The TMC was designed to compensate Bus &Eacute;ireann for costs involved in running the School Transport Scheme which are not billed separately to the Department. The reason that these costs are not billed on a standalone basis is that significant indirect costs are not as easily identified as they are shared across business units and therefore had be allocated to each business unit on a fair and equitable basis. <\/p><p>Based on the 1975 Arrangements this Transport management charge was set at 13% of certain direct costs, which meant that any increase in the direct cost base resulted in an increase in indirect costs payable by the Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann. This resulted in a surplus on the uncommitted reserve for the school transport scheme when the actual charges were lower than the agreed TMC in any one year. In any given year this balance was ring-fenced entirely for expenditure on the school transport scheme for investment on enhancements in a number of areas of the scheme in recent years, including IT, customer service and investment in fleet.

Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. <\/p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  <\/p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.  <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.<\/p>  <p>  Minister McHugh is fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration.

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. <\/p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.<\/p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.  <\/p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.<\/p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  <\/p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me.

The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.<\/p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.<\/p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.<\/p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.<\/p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300097#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300097#WRO04400"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[4526\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300097#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the staffing arrangements for a school (details supplied) will be reviewed as a matter of urgency in respect of the publication of staffing arrangements in primary schools for the 2020\/2021 school year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30<sup>th<\/sup>September. <\/p><p>Staffing arrangements for the 2020\/21 school year are available in Circular 0018\/2020, which has been published on the Department website.

For your record, please see below copy of response that issued:<\/p><p>Leaving Certificate Computer Science (LCCS) was introduced on a phased basis from September 2018 in 40 schools. The 40 schools involved in the phase 1 rollout of this new subject were selected following an open call to all schools inviting them to express their interest in providing LCCS. <\/p><p>Access to LCCS during phase 1 of the subject&rsquo;s implementation is limited to students attending timetabled Computer Science classes in the 40 phase 1 schools. LCCS is operating to a 2-cycle phased introduction model with access restricted to designated schools for the first two leaving certificate examination cohorts, in 2020 and in 2021. The rationale for this is based on several key requirements i.e.: <\/p><p>- a need to ensure that all students sitting the examination have had access to the available supports and relevant teaching and learning methodologies;<\/p><p>- all students taking the subject will have had significant teacher oversight throughout the completion of their coursework components, which must then be confirmed and countersigned by the principal of each school where students have taken Computer Science.

I have spoken to a number of secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. <\/p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020. <\/p><p>In Spring 2019 I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.

Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.<\/p><p>The survey of Secretaries and Caretakers identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars.

The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. <\/p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.

But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.<\/p><p>Special Schools funded by my Department are established as special primary schools and cater for children and young persons with complex special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.<\/p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.<\/p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. <\/p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, consider the capacity of the school for such a class including the availability of suitable accommodation. <\/p><p>The NCSE is finalising plans for a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for September 2020. This process is ongoing.<\/p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places. <\/p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.<\/p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  <\/p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.<\/p><p>The process was first activated in April 2019 when the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) informed my Department under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 of a shortage of school places for children with special educational needs in the Dublin 15 area.<\/p><p>This was followed by an extended and intensive engagement with schools in the area, seeking their willingness to open a special class.<\/p><p>In May 2019, letters issued to the principals and chairpersons of boards of management in 22 schools in Dublin 15 requesting that they give serious consideration to the need for more special education provision.<\/p><p>In June 2019, my Department served statutory notices under Section 37A (5) on 18 schools and 2 patrons in Dublin 15. These notices communicated my opinion that they should make additional provision for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>Following further consultations with two patron bodies and site visits by technical teams to the schools, in August 2019 second legal notices were served under Section 37A on 6 schools in Dublin 15 <\/p><p>Significant progress was made as a result of this process with 7 primary schools in the Dublin 15 area agreeing to open ASD special classes, providing special class places for 42 children along with the establishment of the new Danu Community Special School with provision for 40 special school places.<\/p><p>6 of the new special classes were established following the activation of Section 37A of the Education Act 1998. 1 school volunteered to establish a special class.<\/p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows the real and practical challenges that can be addressed when opening new special classes and how we can resolve these challenges by working together and in partnership.<\/p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020\/21.  <\/p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.<\/p><p>On 21 April 2020, I received a report from the NCSE , pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.<\/p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE had undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.<\/p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.<\/p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open additional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.<\/p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.<\/p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.<\/p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.<\/p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300100#WRR04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300100#WRR04400"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[5193\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300100#WRR04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the allocation of funding to a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the school in question made an application under my Department's Additional School Accommodation Scheme.

This provision has been superceded by new arragements for the allocation of SNAs to schools.  <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, schools have been notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2020\/21.  The arrangements include the following provisions:  <\/p>  <p>  - 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020\/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  <\/p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. <\/p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  <\/p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.  <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. It provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).  <\/p>  <p>  The ambition of the Act, which is wholly appropriate, does mean that it is challenging and complex to implement.  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.   <\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  <\/p>  <p>  To provide safeguards against exploitation of persons with decision-making difficulties, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 creates a number of offences in relation to persons with decision-making capacity difficulties. In particular, section 145 of the Act provides that a decision-making assistant, co-decision-maker, decision-making representative, attorney, or designated healthcare representative for a person who wilfully ill-treats or neglects that person will be guilty of an offence.   <\/p>  <p>  The Act also creates a number of offences in relation to coercion or undue influence of a person with capacity difficulties that forces the person to enter into, alter or revoke one of the decision-making support arrangements under the Act.  Coercion or undue influence includes any case where a person&rsquo;s access to, or continued stay in, a designated centre or mental health facility, is contingent (whether in whole or in part) on the person having to, or being led to believe that he or she has to, enter into (or alter or revoke) a decision-making support arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, the Policing and Community Safety Bill is being drafted by my Department to give legislative effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI). It will redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable and place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety. It will also provide for a new coherent governance and oversight framework to empower the Garda Commissioner to act as CEO supported and held to account by a non-executive Board, ensure strong internal governance and robust, transparent external oversight and effective accountability which will ultimately lead to a better run organisation and more effective policing. <\/p>  <p>  Although significant operational and other policy across health sector organisations has been in place for some time, the Minister for Health has identified a need to establish a national sectorial policy for safeguarding adults in the health and social care sector. The Government subsequently approved the development of an overarching policy on adult safeguarding across the public, voluntary and private health sector. <\/p>  <p>  As I understand it, the Department of Health is advancing the necessary work, including client, expert and stakeholder engagement, and that preparation of this policy is advancing well. At present, the aim is to substantially complete work this year on a draft health sector policy subject to Government approval, with a focus in 2021 of preparing and planning for implementation, including consideration of necessary actions and tools to support roll out across health and social care services. In the meantime, adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector is addressed on the basis of: <\/p>  <p>  Cross-sectorial legislation such as vetting legislation, legislation on withholding information on certain offences against children and vulnerable persons, criminal law, equal status legislation, legislation underpinning the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and assisted decision-making (capacity) legislation;  <\/p>  <p>  An operational policy, currently under revision, which applies to all HSE and HSE-funded social care services (the \"&ldquo;Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse - National Policy and Procedures (2014)&rdquo; and joint national adult safeguarding standards prepared by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission and approved in 2019 by the Minister for Health, applicable to regulated social care and healthcare (including mental health) services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300102#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cyberbullying Issues","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300102#WRT02900"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[4100\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300102#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to revise harassment legislation here taking into consideration the impact of cyberbullying on the mental health of a person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>I remain concerned at the deeply harmful effects which cyber-bullying can have on persons who experience that or other harmful online behaviours.

It reflects the commitment in the Programme for Government to create an equal, fair and inclusive society for all, to target discrimination and to enable LGBTI+ people to overcome the barriers they face. <\/p>  <p>  The development of this Strategy was underpinned by a robust consultation process from October 2018 until February 2019 including a series of regional and thematically focused workshops. Specific workshop sessions were organised for international protection applicants, migrants and refugees.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Strategy recognises the vulnerability of LGBTI+ people within the International Protection process and commits to measures to ensure they are treated sensitively and provided with appropriate supports over the course of the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  These measures include the introduction of new National Standards for our accommodation centres.  The National Standards, published last August last year, were developed with UNHCR Ireland and members of the NGO community. The Standards are being implemented in new centres that are being contracted at present. <\/p>  <p>  One of the Standards, which will benefit members of the LGBTI+ community in our accommodation centres, will be the need for continuous training to improve the service for all living in the centre, and confidential information provision through leaflets and posters in order to promote dignity. <\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy of some current measures in place in our centres.<\/p>  <p>  A Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment is implemented in our accommodation centres, which includes safeguarding residents from harassment or violence based on their sexual orientation.    <\/p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department  (IPAS ) have staff present at the International Protection Office when a person first applies for International Protection. Should an applicant require accommodation or other services, IPAS determines the most suitable accommodation based on the needs of each individual or family group.  Where a person discloses their self-determined identity to IPAS, they are, in so far as is possible and practicable, assigned accommodation based on their needs. This determination may include the provision of shared accommodation with a partner who is also seeking accommodation or being accommodated within the Direct Provision system.  This would, of course, only apply where this information is disclosed.  <\/p>  <p>  At any time during their stay in an accommodation centre, a resident has the option to request a transfer to a more suitable centre.  The policy of the IPAS is to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of all residents. Staff working in accommodation centres receive regular training to equip them with the skills to support all residents.  <\/p>  <p>  The IPAS liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support.  In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, LGBT Ireland has facilitated a monthly peer support group for LGBTI+ people in the International Protection process.  Is Rainbow Muid continues to be active and provide vital supports to LGBTI+ people living in our accommodation centres at this time.<\/p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that IPAS together with the Inclusion, Equality and Gender Equality Unit of my Department are in the process of developing a broad LGBTI+ policy, which will include a transgender accommodation policy to promote equality, take account of people's self-determined identity and ensure that the safety and wellbeing of all residents is also promoted. <\/p>  <p>  It had been hoped that the LGBTI+ policy for IPAS would be finalised by the end of the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the Covid-19 crisis. However, important contacts have been made between IPAS and support agencies in the LGBTI community and a meeting between LGBT Ireland and IPAS took place at the beginning of March 2020. Further meetings with TENI and BelongTo will be arranged soon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commission on the Future of Policing Reports","counter":1044,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1045,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[4301\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1477","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1046,"content":"<p>In December 2018, Government published <i>A Policing Service for our Future <\/i>(APSFF) &ndash; the 4-year Plan (2019-2022) to implement the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland &ndash; <i>The Future of Policing in Ireland<\/i>.<\/p><p>The plan is a living document and I understand that throughout the implementation process, it is reviewed and updated, to maintain ambitious but realistic commitments and timeframes.

Its core membership comprises senior officials from the organisations most closely involved in driving the reform programme &ndash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Department of Justice and Equality; the Department of the Taoiseach; and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Act 2019 was signed into law on 11 June 2019 following its approval by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019.<\/p>  <p>  That Act deleted the following subsection from Article 41.3 of the Constitution:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.&rdquo;,<\/p>  <p>  and substituted that subsection with the following:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; Provision may be made by law for the recognition under the law of the State of a dissolution of marriage granted under the civil law of another state.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The amendment will allow a change in the law to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces.  The current law on recognition of foreign divorces has remained as it is was before the Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution as The Law Reform Commission, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform, is examining recognition of foreign divorces.  When the expert report of the Law Reform Commission is completed, it will provide valuable guidance for the development of proposals for legislation to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Family Law Act 2019 provided for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the United Kingdom, in the event of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union occurring without an agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union setting out the arrangements for such withdrawal.  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 with such an agreement in place. Part 3 of the Family Law Act 2019 will therefore not be commenced. Issues relating to the recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK after the end of the transition period are currently under consideration in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Status","counter":1065,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1066,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[4401\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a matter (details supplied) in relation to citizenship will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1067,"content":"<p>My Department has no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Furthermore, statistics are not compiled in the manner sought by the Deputy and, as such, I am not in a position to provide the requested information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":1068,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1069,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[4402\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the review of the permitted absences under the residency criterion for an application for a certificate of naturalisation as laid out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1070,"content":"<p>The review of the continuous residence provision in the 1956 Act referred to by the Deputy is ongoing within my Department.

The five refugee families comprised of 17 people in total and both the refugees and local communities have reported very positive experiences. <\/p><p>The Community Sponsorship Ireland Programme is a complementary refugee resettlement stream to the traditional state-centred model.

As of 30 December 2019, 3,206 persons have arrived under the IRPP, inclusive of those who were resettled under the Community Sponsorship programme.<\/p><p>It is up to these community groups to access accommodation locally for these families and support them as they access services. All refugees are fully entitled to health, education and social welfare services, but the community groups support the families in navigating these services. <\/p><p>To date, eight refugee families (30 individuals) have arrived in Ireland under Community Sponsorship and have been warmly received by their host communities. A further nine<i><\/i>communities have been approved as Community Sponsors Groups and are now actively undergoing required training through their respective Regional Support Organisation. An additional application has been received from a community organisation and is currently awaiting recognition as a Community Sponsorship Group.<\/p><p>Community Sponsorship has been successfully operating in Canada for over 40 years and research from that country shows better outcomes for the refugees.

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  I am assured however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to their optimum use.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as at 30 April 2020, there are 14,714 Garda Members.

However to be of assistance I have can provide detail to the Deputy on the estimated cost of increasing the Garda strength by 1,000 members.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Garda management that the estimated cost of recruiting an additional 1,000 Garda members would be approximately &euro;23.3m in a full year. <\/p>  <p>  I should point out that the Garda authorities note that this estimated figure relates to the costs of newly attested Garda&iacute; only.   It may be noted in addition that payroll costs for new Garda recruits include a basic allowance of &euro;184 per week.  After 32 weeks of training, Garda recruits are attested and move on to the first point of the Garda pay scale. The overall estimate provided includes Employer's PRSI and an estimation of allowances which Garda members may qualify for depending on their assignments. The annual cost of these additional recruits would continue to increase as the members move up the Garda Pay scale each year. This estimated costing does not take into account any pay rises occurring after 1 January 2021. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that as of 30 April 2020, there are over 3,000 Garda staff undertaking administrative, professional, technical and industrial support duties in the organisation.

The projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects in place throughout the State. Funding ofapproximately &euro;18 million is being provided by my Department in 2020. This funding supports approximately 265 FTE youth justice worker posts, though it should be noted that this number can vary throughout the year for a variety of reasons, including leave, and the inclusion of part time workers in the figure. <\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in the last two years to extend the Garda Youth Diversion Project network to ensure that the service is available throughout the State.  This has been achieved by extending existing project catchment areas and allocation of additional staff.  There are a small number of areas where this approach would not be suitable and these are being considered for the establishment of new projects instead.  <\/p>  <p>  Catchment areas for projects are determined in consultation with local community groups, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders on a case-by-case basis. As the GYDPs have evolved organically since their inception, catchment areas vary depending on the project&rsquo;s background and local needs.  Consequently, it is not possible to provide a standard estimate of the cost of additional projects.  <\/p>  <p>  It may also be noted that in recent years, the GYDP model has been developed and extended, with a renewed emphasis on family support and early intervention\/preventative work, as well as on working with harder-to-engage young people, including those not suitable for the Garda Diversion Programme.  Where any new projects are being established, the minimum core of the project will now include 2 youth justice workers, a family support worker, an early intervention support worker and an outreach worker to engage with harder-to-reach young people.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to future policy in this area, I have chaired an expert steering group over the past twelve months to lead my Department's work developing a new Youth Justice Strategy and I expect a draft of the Strategy to be published in the near future for a further round of consultations, with a view to it being finalised and published thereafter.  <\/p>  <p>  The new Strategy will include a focus on how youth justice policy can more closely align to other child and youth policies, including targeted policies to support children and families who experience multiple disadvantage and links between schools and other services and programmes. A particular priority is responding effectively to the needs of the harder-to-engage cohort of children and young people.  The Strategy will include measures to address fragmentation within current services and programme delivery at local and national level so as to support a holistic response to the needs of particular children at risk, in the specific family and community context, rather than separate responses to different aspects of need at different ages and stages of the family cycle. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1094,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[4706\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300103#WRU06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated cost to the Vote of his Department if the rate of employer PRSI was increased to 15.75% for the portion of salaries over &euro;100,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1096,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the estimated cost to my Department of an increase in employer PRSI to 15.75% for the portion of salaries over &euro;100,000 is &euro;32,681.

Tribunal Members meet on a regular basis to hear appeals and to discuss their collective decision on appeal cases.<\/p>  <p>  The Tribunal's Secretariat receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other relevant bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to each case.

The duration of each case can vary depending on the nature and individual circumstances and is influenced by factors including the time involved in the provision of the required documentation to the Secretariat. For example, final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in some cases, the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years.

In 2020 to date, 102 decisions under the General Scheme have been made by Tribunal members.

The scheme permits applications not only new CCTV systems but also for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. <\/p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>Full details of the Scheme, including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation and are available to download from my Department's website,  or by emailing fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300104#WRV06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Certificates","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300104#WRV06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[5027\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300104#WRV06300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress in respect of an application for naturalisation by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned continues to be processed by my Department and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

We are working in particular with the HSE National Social Inclusion team and following all its advice. Our centre managers are working closely with the Department, the HSE and residents to ensure that centres are safe and that guidelines on social distancing are observed.<\/p><p>The direction from the HSE National Social Inclusion Office is that, during the COVID crisis, non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.<\/p><p>We are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at: .<\/p><p>That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.<\/p><p>We are doing everything that we can to protect the health and welfare of our residents and centre staff, as well as that of the wider community. We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.<\/p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. <\/p><p>The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. We have opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities (with capacity for 299 people) in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. <\/p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Cahersiveen and Tullamore. <\/p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over. <\/p><p>The vast majority of the rooms in the new accommodation being used to support social and physical distancing are twin rooms accommodating two people. If any person is being accommodated in these locations based on an identified vulnerability (age or medical condition), they have their own bedroom and their own bathroom to facilitate their cocooning.<\/p><p>We have cocooned all residents over the age of 65 and anyone advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness. <\/p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for all centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as needed.<\/p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, we have also put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. This service will also be used to advise, support and work with those locations where vulnerable groups are present in respect of the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.<\/p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website www.accommodationcentres.ie. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing\/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.<\/p><p>The website also includes information for healthcare workers on the HSE's National Guidance Document on Temporary Accommodation for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision are eligible to apply for accommodation under the scheme via a referral form to the HSE. We are encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and centre managers will continue to work closely together during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300105#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":1204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300105#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1205,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[5126\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300105#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to delays in the establishment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority advisory committee on patents of precedence; if his attention has been further drawn to the impact this delay might have on the planned admission of senior counsel to the inner Bar later in 2020 and the attendant delays in the efficient administration of justice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1206,"content":"<p>The Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been making detailed preparations for the establishment and coming into operation of the Advisory Committee on the Grant of Patents of Precedence under the relevant terms of part 12 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which I commenced on 7 October 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I have nominated Dr. Don Thornhill as the first lay member of the Authority to serve on the Advisory Committee under the relevant terms of section 172 of the Act.

Everyone should understand that the restrictions brought in to tackle Covid-19 do not stop them being implemented, and should not be used as an excuse by either party.  In particular, the Regulations made by the Minister for Health, which came into effect on Wednesday 8 April, recognise the right of a parent, guardian, or person having a right of access to a child to leave their home in order to give effect to arrangements for access by that person or for another parent, guardian or person having such right of access.<\/p><p>Clearly, however, during this time there may be instances where it is impossible for couples to adhere strictly to the terms of an Order, and the President of the District Court recently clarified that parents could come to mutually agreed arrangements for alternative contact, which could involve phone calls, or skype etc., such agreement being noted by email or text message.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that if parties cannot agree on an alternative arrangement, mediation services are still available and should be used.

Neither I nor my Department are involved in such matters.<\/p><p>In the current exceptional circumstances, while court offices are still open, they are only open for essential business, and by appointment only.  The Judiciary and the Courts Service have advised that the District Court will continue to hear urgent matters in all District Court Districts throughout the country as before, and will resume hearings of certain other urgent matters.  Urgent matters are now extended to include additional areas in Criminal, Family, and Child Care Law.  In the area of Family Law the President of the District Court announced 8 May changes for matters which can be dealt with.  These include the following:<\/p><p>- Applications and hearings for breach of maintenance or access that have occurred during the emergency period or applications and hearings for temporary guardianship orders.<\/p><p>- Remote call-overs and hearings may be conducted in some courts.<\/p><p>- Consent orders that do not require the hearing of evidence may be applied for by email by the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor exhibiting consent in writing from the respondent&rsquo;s solicitor. Following consideration by an assigned Judge orders will issue from the Court Office as appropriate without the need for the parties or their legal representatives to attend court.<\/p><p>According to the Practice Direction of the President of the District Court, a case which does not come into the defined urgent category can be treated as urgent if a good case can be made, and this will be decided, by the Court, on a case by case basis.

A new entrant administrative Clerical Officer would have 22 days annual leave. An ICO works fewer days (although with a longer working day) than an administrative Clerical Officer, being rostered for seven 12-hour shifts over a 14 day period (which will include a weekend) and availing of 7 non-work days in each two week period.

An ICO, availing of 15.49 shifts per leave year, with each shift being 12 hours gross in duration, avails of 185 hours and 53 minutes of annual leave.

We are advised that this is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff.<\/p>  <p>  The centre is currently catered with three meals and snacks being provided to residents daily. In line with overall policy objectives the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period.

This relocation process was carried out in full consultation and agreement with the HSE National Social Inclusion Office, which is providing a lead to our International Protection Accommodation Service regarding public health. These residents were transferred to two accommodation centres on 18 and 19 March 2020, some eight weeks ago. I can confirm to the Deputy that no resident was awaiting testing or test results at the time the transfers were made.

A total of 26,700 more people in the South-East are in employment in Q4 2019 than in Q1 2015 when the Regional Action Plan for Jobs started, and unemployment in the South East has reduced from 11.7 percent to 6.8 percent in the same period. <\/p>  <p>  I launched the South-East Regional Enterprise Plan in March 2019, one of nine new regional plans that build on the previous Regional Action Plans for Jobs. The South-East Plan has focused on a number of  Strategic Objectives: building enterprise resilience; marketing the region; a regional engagement strategy on key infrastructure priorities; ensuring the South East is a learning region; and tourism growth. The Plan has commenced implementation, led by the Regional Steering Committee involving the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, LEOs, tourism bodies, HEIs, ETBs, and others. <\/p>  <p>  While we have had very good success to date through the Regional Enterprise Plan in reducing unemployment; in the context of Brexit and other global challenges we need to also focus on the creation of quality and sustainable jobs. My Department's Future Jobs Ireland initiative launched early last year with the Department of the Taoiseach, is our plan to meet these challenges. It includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the South-East has 70 IDA Ireland supported companies employing 12,213 people, up 1.5% from 2018. The IDA will continue to work to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in the South-East, promoting the region's existing concentrations of pharma, MedTech, financial services, AgriTech and high-value manufacturing activities. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, there were 19,868 people employed in 459 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the South-East, up 2.5% from 2018. 'Powering the Regions' is Enterprise Ireland's new regional plan which sets out the focus of its activities regionally, including for the South East. There was also a net increase of 360 jobs supported by the South East LEOs during 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development and the South-East has seen a number of successes under my own Department&rsquo;s regional funding streams.  These include over &euro;12.1m under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), &euro;377,520 under the Regional Technology Clustering Fund and &euro;345,320 under the LEO Competitive Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plan, and with all regional stakeholders working together, the South-East is well positioned to realise its enterprise potential and see better quality, sustainable jobs and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits","counter":1268,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX01025"},{"type":"question","counter":1269,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[4190\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX01050","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding the reintroduction of horticultural work permits; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1270,"content":"<p>AWAITING REPLY FROM DEPARTMENT<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX01075","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":1271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1272,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[4288\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if immediate financial contingencies or assistance packages have been explored to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak specifically cash flow remedies for businesses at serious risk of losing significant business through a fall in clients; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1273,"content":"<p>On 8 April, I announced a major expansion of supports for all businesses impacted by COVID-19.

So, if a Government Department or state body does not pay a supplier for 90 days they must pay 60 days of late payment interest to that supplier, as well as the compensation payment. Departments and state bodies report on payments which have taken longer than 30 days. My Department does not receive information on the number of late days in excess of the 30-day limit.  <\/p>  <p>  The interest and compensation rates applied are in line with the Directive. Late payment interest is currently set at 8% (daily rate of 0.022%), on the outstanding balance of the payment.  This rate of interest is in line with the requirements of the Directive and is also in line with interest rates applied by other Member States.

The scheme operates by providing an 80% guarantee to participating finance providers (currently AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank) on qualifying facilities to SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  On 2 May, I announced a &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates. This scheme will include primary producers. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS) makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) though participating lenders. My Department developed this scheme in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  Finance provided under the scheme is competitively priced and offered at favourable terms, for example no security required for loans up to &euro;500,000. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019 across all sectors and regions including in exporting businesses and family businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. On 8 April, I announced a further expansion of this scheme and my Department is now working through the details of a significant expansion to bring this funding to market as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme continues to provide funding for businesses that have been demonstrably impacted by negative affects arising from the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":1299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1300,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[5298\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of protected disclosures her Department has received since the legislation was introduced; the number of protected disclosures examined to conclusion by year in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1301,"content":"<p>The number of matters raised in my Department under Protected Disclosures legislation since the Protected Disclosures Act came into effect on 15th July 2014 is set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Total Issues Raised <\/th>       <th>Action Taken<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014\/2015 <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>       <td>2 Examined to conclusion1 Referred to another Department and individual advised<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>       <td>3 Examined to conclusion1 Referred to another Department and individual advised<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>       <td>2 Examined to conclusion2 Referred to another Department and individual advised<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>1 Examined to conclusion<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>       <td>2 Examined to conclusion<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (To mid-May)<\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>       <td>1 Under ongoing review <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Economic and Social Council","counter":1302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1303,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[5474\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the recent report number 19 by the NESC; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1304,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of NESC&rsquo;s report on vulnerable employment and Just Transition last month.

The Brexit Loan Scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are or will be Brexit impacted and which meet the scheme criteria.  The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged through the European Investment Fund (EIF) InnovFin guarantee to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. <\/p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.<\/p><p>Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  <\/p><p><b>The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS)<\/b>was launched in April 2019 to provide for &euro;300m in longer- term lending to SMEs, mid-caps and farmers.

Based on the contribution by DAFM to the scheme, a target of 40% of total lending is geared to farmers and the food sector.<\/p><p>The FGLS is delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating finance providers. The SBCI provides an uncapped guarantee of 80% to the participating financial providers. The scheme is underpinned by a 64% counter-guarantee to the SBCI from the EIF. This counter-guarantee provides significant risk protection to the Exchequer against potential losses from the loan guarantee scheme.  <\/p><p>The uptake of the scheme has significantly surpassed expectations, such that the initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS scheme has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses.

Of the 138 projects for the period up to December 2019, 112 were on track, 24 have been progressed with minor challenges, and 2 with significant challenge. This work has been carried out by many stakeholders, including from the Department of Health, the HSE, the voluntary and community bodies and key partners.

This is expected to benefit more than 400,000 patients; <\/p><p>4. on the strengthening of the HSE with the formal appointment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Board in June 2019 and the introduction of a new HSE Chief Executive Officer.  <\/p><p>Moving into the second full year of implementation and building on the foundations put in place in 2019, the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme will work on three priority reform programmes for 2020.  These programmes are carefully planned to be delivered over a number of years, and will: <\/p><p>- continue the reorganisation of the HSE into Regional Health Areas, which will deliver integrated patient-centred services that are safe, local and fairly distributed;<\/p><p>- implement the recommendations of the Capacity Review 2018, encompassing both investment, as well as resource optimisation which will reduce waiting times and develop extra capacity for population growth in the health and social care system; and <\/p><p>- examine the eligibility and entitlement to health and social care services of our citizens to make sure cost is not a barrier to getting care in a timely manner.<\/p><p>The past year has seen the delivery of the majority of actions committed for 2019, the first full year of the ten-year Sl&aacute;intecare strategy. To succeed, Sl&aacute;intecare requires the long-term commitment of targeted and protected funding and support to enable the delivery of the reform programme. This funding will be invested strategically and will support the overall vision for reform, with a consistent focus on effectiveness, efficiency and value for money. In parallel, with Government commitment to funding, there is a requirement on all parts of the health delivery system to optimise the use of the scarce resources already made available to it. Thus, a two-pronged approach to reform is being undertaken: one of investment and one of resource optimisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":1333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX07400"},{"type":"question","counter":1334,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[3937\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300106#WRX07500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to add Crohn's disease as a qualifying illness for the long-term illness scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1335,"content":"<p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p><p>As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019, the HSE approved 31 new medicines (including  ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) on a patient specific basis) and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. These approvals represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p><p>The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.<\/p><p>My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. <\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. <\/p><p>I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300107#WRY07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Administration","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[4109\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which the medical card client registration unit treats medical card applications when queued for the attention of the deciding officer;

This is known as the three year cap. This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where  specific conditions are met.<\/p>  <p>  Rental income, including income arising from the rental of a farm, is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment, and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. Allowable deductions include income tax and, therefore, any income tax arising from rental income should be deducted; other deductions include some health expenses, levies required by law to be paid, and interest on some loans in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government.

The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme on 13 November 2019. Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Department's ongoing work to respond to the challenges arising as a result. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.<\/p>  <p>  As an element of this question is in relation to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy on this element as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":1425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1426,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[4141\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if asthma will be included under the long-term illness scheme in the near future.","asker":"1508","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1427,"content":"<p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).

They share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. Hydroxychloroquine is licensed in Ireland for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatological conditions caused or aggravated by sunlight.  It is not licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. There are no medicinal products containing chloroquine phosphate authorised for the Irish market. <\/p><p>The COVID-19 Evidence Review Group (ERG) for Medicines was established to support the HSE in managing the significant amount of information on treatments for COVID-19. This COVID- 19 Evidence Review Group is comprised of evidence synthesis practitioners from across the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE), Medicines Management Programme (MMP) and the National Medicines Information Centre (NMIC). The group respond to queries raised via the Office of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer, National Clinical Programmes and the Department of Health and respond in a timely way with the evidence review supporting the query.<\/p><p>The Evidence Review Group undertook a rapid evidence review of antiviral therapies in the treatment of Covid-19. In vitro, pre-clinical studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be effective treatments for Covid-19. However, emerging clinical evidence is increasingly showing a lack of significant clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers have registered hundreds of clinical trials for COVID-19, many of which are actively recruiting. COVID-19 trials need to be well designed and adequately powered to generate robust evidence. A number of large, international clinical trials of investigational treatments for COVID-19 (including hydroxychloroquine) are underway in Europe. These include the Solidarity trial, the REMAP-CAP trial and the Discovery trial. <\/p><p>Based on the best evidence available, at present, prescribing of antivirals for the management of patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease should be restricted to hospitals only. Therefore, any use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19 is restricted to use in hospital settings and in line with the recommended guidance in the Clinical Management of Acute Respiratory Infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).<\/p><p><i><\/i><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Chloroquine is not listed for use in this guidance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ06800"},{"type":"question","counter":1474,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[4196\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if additional home help will be provided for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1475,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ07100"},{"type":"question","counter":1477,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[4197\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300108#WRZ07200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment will be expedited for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1478,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This facility was not a HSE centre but was a centre offering certain health services in a private capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Following its investigations, CORU was satisfied that certain persons working in the facility were not registered with CORU but were using protected titles. CORU sought a High Court injunction requiring the individuals in question to cease and desist from using the titles while unregistered with CORU. The Directors provided undertakings to the High Court, including that they would cease and desist from using the titles in contravention of the Act and would inform all previous and existing clients that at no time while providing services in the State were they entitled to use the titles.  CORU has also instituted criminal proceedings against the individuals involved; these proceedings are due to take place in Cork District Court later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, there has been a sizeable investment in the reform and improvement of children&rsquo;s disability services in Ireland.  As part of Transforming Lives, the HSE is currently implementing the &ldquo;Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme (2009)&rdquo;. This programme requires a reconfiguration of all current HSE and HSE funded children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based children&rsquo;s disability network teams. The overall aim is to achieve a national equitable approach to service provision for all children based on their individual need - regardless of their disability, where they live or where they go to school. Services will be provided through the children&rsquo;s disability networks across each of nine Community Healthcare Organisations, comprising of specialist multi-disciplinary teams to work with complex disability needs.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300109#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1514,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[4220\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300109#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps being taken to ensure a person (details supplied) with additional needs has an appropriate adult day service placement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1515,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Ireland will be co-leading on one of the Work Packages under the Joint Action, on &ldquo;Best Practices in the field of marketing of unhealthy foods to children and adolescents&rdquo;.  Among the key objectives of this are: to develop effective policies to reduce the exposure of children to unhealthy food marketing, and to deliver protocols and tools to measure the reduction in the marketing of unhealthy food to children, with a particular focus on digital marketing and health inequalities.  Seventeen EU countries will be participating in this Work Package and this sharing of expertise and experience is expected to be greatly beneficial in informing Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach to implementing and monitoring the Codes of Practice.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Action application is awaiting final approval from the EU Commission.  This was delayed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis, but it is hoped that approval will be received in the coming weeks.

However, I wish to inform the Deputy that it is proposed that the LTI Scheme would be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. <\/p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300111#WRCC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Contracts","counter":1666,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300111#WRCC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1667,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[4447\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300111#WRCC04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he plans to implement in respect of the difficulties in the recruitment and retention of general practitioners with particular reference to practices in Bawnogue, Clondalkin (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1468","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1668,"content":"<p>The Government is aware of the workforce issues facing general practice and has implemented a range of measures in recent years to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. <\/p>  <p>  These include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the number of medical graduates undertaking GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 192 filled places in 2019. 217 training places are available for 2020, and the number of doctors applying to the training scheme commencing in 2020 is the highest on record at 461. <\/p>  <p>  The recent Agreement on GP contractual reforms will see an increase in expenditure on GP services of &euro;210 million annually by 2023, providing significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs, and increases in supports for rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation.<\/p>  <p>  Improved family friendly arrangements are an important feature of the revised contractual arrangements, with an increase in the locum rate for maternity and paternity cover, and an increase in the paternity leave allowance from 3 days to 2 weeks.

The Review includes provisions which are intended to strengthen the protections for people who are detained without consent in approved centres.

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures and life limiting procedures including cataracts.<\/p><p>At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have consistently improved and at the end of December 2019, they stood at 4,388. Of these, 396 patients are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 91% when compared to July 2017, when the number waiting over 9 months stood at 4,371. A key development to improve access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. <\/p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 May.

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures and life limiting procedures including cataracts.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have consistently improved and at the end of December 2019, they stood at 4,388. Of these, 396 patients are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 91% when compared to July 2017, when the number waiting over 9 months stood at 4,371. A key development to improve access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 May.   The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing provision of non-covid care including more routine care.

In countries which do not fluoridate water this can mean fluoridation of salt or provision of community fluoridation through other means. <\/p>  <p>  European Council Directive 98\/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg\/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland, which is set at between 0.6-0.8 parts per million. <\/p>  <p>  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, is a safe and effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Recruitment","counter":1869,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1870,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[4656\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person offered a job (details supplied) with the HSE in January 2019 will receive their work contract to commence work; the reason the person has not been employed to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1871,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":1872,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1873,"qnumday":639,"qnumall":"[4663\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of ensuring that all primary care teams have at least one mental health post; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1608","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1874,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1876,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[4664\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of increasing the number of medical detoxification and rehabilitation beds by 20; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1608","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1877,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"question","counter":1879,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[4674\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300114#WRFF03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of increasing respite care service provision by 20%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1608","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1880,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Applicants from non-EU countries need to have their qualifications verified through the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) prior to applying to the Medical Council.  The Council can then confirm the relevant qualifications have been verified through the Electronic Portfolio of International Credentials (EPIC), available through the ECFMG website.  All non-EU applicants are required to provide documentary evidence of English language proficiency as part of their application and guidelines as to what can be accepted as evidence of communication skills are available on the Medical Council&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  Doctors who graduate from Non-European Union\/European Economic Area countries or Switzerland may be required to sit one of the Medical Council's examinations.  Doctors intending to pursue registration in the general or trainee specialist division may be required to sit the Pre-Registration Examination System (PRES).  The PRES examinations are primarily a test of knowledge and clinical skills in the main clinical disciplines of Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Medicine\/General Practice. The PRES examinations are based on the Eight Domains of Good Professional Practice as devised by Medical Council.  All applicants for registration will be required to undergo a Level 1 assessment and verification of their documentation and alternative qualification, prior to eligibility for the PRES Level 3 being granted. PRES Level 3 is an assessment of a doctor's clinical skills.<\/p>  <p>   Applicants from EU\/EEA countries are entitled to &ldquo;automatic recognition&rdquo; of their qualifications under the provisions of the EU Professional Qualifications Directive 2005\/36\/EC.  Prospective applicants are required to hold a qualification listed in Annex V 5.1.1. and\/or Annex V 5.1.2, awarded by the relevant body.  All documents submitted need to be notarised\/attested in the correct manner.  The Directive is designed to facilitate the freedom of movement of  professionals within the single market, and to remove barriers to allow this  movement to be as frictionless as possible.  As such, it does not provide for  the blanket language testing of every applicant, although recent updates allow  Member States a little more flexibility to ask for such evidence on a case-by-case basis. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE independently requires a doctor to complete an assessment of their English language capabilities, as part of the employment engagement process.

The 3 medical conditions are<\/p>  <p>  -  spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;<\/p>  <p>  -  intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;<\/p>  <p>  -  severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy. <\/p>  <p>  To date three products have been added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019.

It should only be used where it is likely to be beneficial as outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s guidance on PPE. This guidance is continuously monitored and may change as the coronavirus outbreak evolves. <\/p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has recommended that enhanced public health measures should be introduced to support the home support sector. These include measures to ensure PPE supply to home support providers and supporting access to the provision of training for staff in infection prevention and control. Homecare providers who have contracts with the HSE are able to apply for a supply and replenishment of PPE through their local Community Healthcare Organisation.<\/p>  <p>  Appropriate evidence-based guidance to support the work of health and social care providers on a range of issues, including infection prevention and control, has been developed by both the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and is updated regularly as appropriate and made available on their websites. The HPSC published updated guidance on the use of surgical face masks on 22   April and is now advising that surgical masks should be worn by healthcare workers, including home support workers.  Updated guidance for health and social care workers who visit homes was published on the HPSC website on 24 April.<\/p>  <p>  Homecare workers who are able to provide planned home care for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can play a critical role in helping to manage the COVID-19 emergency. Homecare workers undertaking this role will require some additional training to manage the associated risks. The most critical element of managing this risk is to review key skills (especially hand hygiene) but there will also be a requirement for appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).<\/p>  <p>  The HPSC has advised home care providers that their healthcare workers should be told that if they are unwell and have symptoms of Covid-19 such as a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath, or if they are a contact of someone with Covid-19, they must call their manager before going to work. If a staff member develops symptoms while at work, they must report immediately to their line manager and not continue to see other clients. If a healthcare worker is concerned that they may have COVID-19 they should stay at home and self-isolate and contact their doctor or occupational health service by telephone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300118#WRKK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":2171,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300118#WRKK03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2172,"qnumday":741,"qnumall":"[5053\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300118#WRKK03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which continuity of home help services will be maintained.","asker":"1467","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2173,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300118#WRKK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300118#WRKK03700"},{"type":"question","counter":2175,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[5055\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300118#WRKK03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); the timeline for the scheduling of the surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1458","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2176,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Former civil and public servants who were in receipt of public service pensions were not affected by these reductions.  <\/p><p>In 2017 the Public Service Stability Agreement was introduced which set about unwinding the affects of FEMPI by restoring pay to civil and public servants through a series of salary increases. Because any individuals who were in receipt of pensions prior to the introduction of FEMPI were not affected by it, they do not stand to benefit from the restoration. <\/p><p>In addition to pay restoration, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER) issued circulars 20\/2017, 2\/2018 and 19\/2019 setting out the treatment of increases to certain public service pensions. Under the provisions of these circulars, a pension increase is applied only in circumstances where the current rate of pay for a serving employee exceeds the pay rate on which the retired staff member&rsquo;s pension is based. In practical terms, this meant that only a small number of pensioners were due an increase with effect from 1 September 2017 (the effective date of the first circular) as their pension was based on a higher rate of pay than the serving employee on that date. As each of the subsequent phases of pay restoration has come into effect, an increasing number of pensioners have become entitled to an increase and this has been applied where relevant. <\/p><p>The HSE has advised that it is working to ensure that all HSE pensioners who were due increases under the circulars had the correct increase applied at the correct phase of pay restoration. This represents a considerable undertaking as each individual pension must be considered on a case by case basis. <\/p><p>The HSE is satisfied that most people who were due an increase with effect from 1 September 2017 have received that increase and subsequent increases, and that any issue of non-application of an increase is in respect of retirees who were not due an increase on 1 September 2017 but who have become entitled as a result of one of the subsequent rounds of pay restoration. Any pension increases due will be paid to retired staff from the appropriate effective date. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300119#WRLL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":2232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300119#WRLL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2233,"qnumday":761,"qnumall":"[5098\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300119#WRLL02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if suitable home help hours will be put in place as a matter of urgency for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2234,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300119#WRLL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":2235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300119#WRLL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2236,"qnumday":762,"qnumall":"[5099\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300119#WRLL02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of works to complete a primary care health centre at Church Street, Moate, County Westmeath; and if this work will be completed within the coming months in view of the fact works on the site have been progressing slowly for a long period of time.

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to access for patients waiting for high volume procedures and life limiting procedures including cataracts.<\/p><p>At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have consistently improved and at the end of December 2019, they stood at 4,388. Of these, 396 patients are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 91% when compared to July 2017, when the number waiting over 9 months stood at 4,371. A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. <\/p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 May.In addition all NTPF activity including validation was suspended in mid March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time. <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy regarding eye procedure waiting lists, is contained in the following tables.<\/p><p>IPDC Ophthalmology Waiting List <table>    <tr>       <th>0-3 Mths<\/th>       <th>3-6 Mths<\/th>       <th>6-9 Mths<\/th>       <th>9-12 Mths<\/th>       <th>12-15 Mths<\/th>       <th>15-18 Mths<\/th>       <th>18-24 Mths<\/th>       <th>24-36 Mths<\/th>       <th>36-48 Mths<\/th>       <th>48+ Mths<\/th>       <th>Grand Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3648<\/td>       <td>3269<\/td>       <td>1174<\/td>       <td>697<\/td>       <td>404<\/td>       <td>275<\/td>       <td>234<\/td>       <td>110<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>9822<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Outpatient Ophthalmology Waiting List <table>    <tr>       <th>0-3Months<\/th>       <th>3-6Months<\/th>       <th>6-9Months<\/th>       <th>9-12Months<\/th>       <th>12-15Months<\/th>       <th>15-18Months<\/th>       <th>18-21Months<\/th>       <th>21-24Months<\/th>       <th>24-36Months<\/th>       <th>36-48Months<\/th>       <th>48+Months<\/th>       <th>Grand Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>7761<\/td>       <td>6380<\/td>       <td>4976<\/td>       <td>4259<\/td>       <td>3119<\/td>       <td>2492<\/td>       <td>2341<\/td>       <td>2029<\/td>       <td>5414<\/td>       <td>2175<\/td>       <td>455<\/td>       <td>41401<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300120#WRMM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care Services","counter":2319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300120#WRMM03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2320,"qnumday":791,"qnumall":"[5234\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300120#WRMM03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to introduce a register to ensure consistency in terms of a qualification and care in respect of care assistants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2321,"content":"<p>A report entitled 'Review of Role and Function of Health Care Assistants' was published in December 2018.

These include appropriate physical infrastructure and equipment, a highly trained multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, radiation therapists, physicists and other health and social care professionals and a system of quality assurance that can ensure that radiation oncology services are safe, effective, equitable, efficient, timely and centred on the patients needs. <\/p>  <p>  A new facility in Cork University Hospital was opened recently, and construction will commence shortly on a new facility in University Hospital Galway. Future expansion of the facility in Beaumont is also envisaged. In line with the National Plan for Radiation Oncology, it is not proposed to establish a centre for radiation oncology in the Midlands.<\/p>  <p>  Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT\/Chemotherapy) is delivered in 26 hospitals across the country, including in the Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore. In the context of Covid-19 some patients who would normally receive their treatment in Tullamore are now being treated in the Hermitage Medical Clinic, Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300120#WRMM06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Groups","counter":2347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300120#WRMM06200"},{"type":"question","counter":2348,"qnumday":801,"qnumall":"[5330\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300120#WRMM06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 161 of 13 November 2019, if an independent external facilitator to engage in a consultative process in respect of Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise has been appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2349,"content":"<p>The appointment of an independent external facilitator for the consultation process has not yet been made.

A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential additional acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency.

The costs that will be covered will be limited to normal costs of operating the hospital.  The final cost will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there will be an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement.  Under the Heads of terms private hospitals are funded to 80% of their estimated monthly costs in advance.

The Working Group&rsquo;s report was published in August 2019.<\/p><p>The role of the Working Group was to investigate, in detail, alternative approaches to dealing with the possession of drugs for personal use in Ireland. Research was conducted on behalf of the Working Group on alternative approaches taken in other jurisdictions, including Portugal and Colorado. Decriminalisation was also considered by this group, however it was concluded that decriminalising drug use would reduce our ability to help those who needed it. It could lead to de facto legalisation of drugs. To inform its deliberations, a public consultation was undertaken in 2018 which comprised of an online questionnaire, focus groups and an open policy debate. There were over 20,000 responses to the online questionnaire. This report also noted the growing dangers associated with cannabis use because of increased THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) levels, and stated the importance of all sectors working together to inform the public about the harms associated with cannabis use and all other illicit drugs. <\/p><p>The report of the Working Group can be found at:  <\/p><p>Following consideration of the report of the Working Group, the Minister for Health, the Minster for Justice and Equality and I announced the adoption of a health-led approach to the possession of drugs for personal use. There are two components to this new Health Diversion Approach whereby a person in possession of drugs, determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be for personal use, on the first occasion would be referred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a mandatory basis to the Health Service Executive for a health screening and brief intervention. On the second occasion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have discretion to issue an Adult Caution.<\/p><p>The Health Diversion Approach seeks to connect drug users with health services and to support them on their path to recovery. It will also give individuals the opportunity to avoid a criminal conviction. A small implementation, monitoring and evaluation group has been set up to progress the Health Diversion Approach.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the very real dangers we are facing as a society in terms of cannabis use. Cannabis use by adolescents, in particular, is worrying as it poses risks of dependence and developing psychotic illness. We cannot be complacent about the risk to health posed by cannabis use. While we pursue our important public health approach to drug use in Ireland, there are no plans to legalise cannabis or any other illicit drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":2541,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":2540,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2541,"qnumday":898,"qnumall":"[5048\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the potential closure of the Longford greyhound race track by the Irish Greyhound Board, if his attention has been further drawn to the importance of the facility to race goers and dog trainers in the north-west region; the efforts his Department can take to help ensure the track remains open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1608","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":2542,"content":"<p>Bord na gCon is a commercial state body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These changes are unavoidable and are largely beyond the control of my Department.  As you know, my Department is the forestry licence consent authority and, since 2017, all licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  <\/p><p>The situation with regard to felling licences has significantly improved since the start of 2020. Since January, 649 felling licences were issued up to 8th May.  These licences cover over 5,900 ha and a volume in excess of 1.6 million m<sup>3<\/sup>.  My Department continues to issue new felling licences at an average rate of approximately 100,000 m3 per week. <\/p><p>In terms of afforestation licences, from January 2018 to the end of December 2019, licences have been issued for 4,000 ha that are available to plant.  Again, since January 2020, 230 afforestation licences for 1,700 ha and 141 forest road licence for 50.7 km have issued.<\/p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and significant resources have been devoted to introducing a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements.  My Department is now meeting those needs as follows:<\/p><p>- New forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff have been assigned to licensing. More forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020.<\/p><p>- Two new ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with four more to be appointed shortly.<\/p><p>- We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contract to provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with 5 new ecologists is due to be signed very soon.<\/p><p>- Additional administrative staff have been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.<\/p><p>- Three planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.<\/p><p>- A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry issues.<\/p><p>In conclusion, let me assure you that our long-term commitment to forestry is unwavering and that every effort is being made to resolve current issues. I acknowledge that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organic Farming Scheme","counter":2553,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT05400"},{"type":"question","counter":2554,"qnumday":902,"qnumall":"[4051\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300125#WRTT05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a payment will be received under the organic farming scheme by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":2555,"content":"<p>The person named is a participant in both the Green, Low Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) and the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS).

However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription.

Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.<\/p><p>In accordance with existing national legislation, antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants.

The loss of high value food service customers is already of significant immediate concern.<\/p><p>The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. These supports include Aids to Private Storage and Exceptional Aid measures, flexibilities when it comes to on-farm inspections and early payment of the Basic Payment Scheme. <\/p><p>Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (, , ), and .Applications for aid may be submitted as of 7 May 2020.<\/p><p>The provision in the regulation with regard to beef is for the entry into storage of separated hindquarters from S, E, U, R or O grade bovines over 8 months. Storage is for a fixed period of 90, 120 or 150 days.  Product currently in storage is not eligible. There is no storage limit, but there is a minimum volume of 15 tonnes\/Contract.  The aid will be provided at a fixed rate of &euro;1,008 (90 days), &euro;1,033 (120 days) or &euro;1,058 (150 days). There is no closing date set in the regulation.<\/p><p>Private Storage Aid (PSA) is a risk management tool \/ safety net available to EU producers of certain agricultural products under the CMO regulation (1308\/2013). The aim is to facilitate producers to store the product for a stipulated temporary storage period. It is not possible to project the effect of Private Storage Aid on farm gate prices. In the first instance, it is for industry to decide if they wish to place product into storage, then the schemes operates on a first-come first-served basis across the EU, there is no specific Member State allocation with the exception of cheese, and also a number of factors will determine farm gate price. <\/p><p>The fact that the entire hindquarter (bone-in or deboned) has to be put into storage, rather than individual steak cuts, limits its practical benefit for the Irish beef industry. Nonetheless, it is an important market support tool to have available.<\/p><p>I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agrifood sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. <\/p><p>Working with my colleague Minister Humphreys, I have ensured that 40% of the &euro;250 million COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme will be available for food businesses. Similarly, 40% of an additional &euro;200 million tranche of the Future Growth Loan Scheme will be ring fenced to provide long-term investment support for primary producers and food businesses. I continue to liaise with the banks on liquidity for the primary sector, and also want to highlight the availability of working capital assistance to farmers and fishers through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan. We will continue to keep the finance needs of the whole agrifood sector under review.<\/p><p>I have already provided an additional &euro;20m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020, on top of the &euro;20 million provided last year for the BEEP pilot. This year&rsquo;s scheme &ndash; the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (Sucklers), will deliver a maximum payment of &euro;90 per suckler cow for the first 10 cows, and &euro;80\/head thereafter. This is a significant increase in the payment available compared to the BEEP Pilot in 2019. This extra funding is available to suckler farmers right now. It is a straightforward scheme, which can deliver a significant cash-flow injection, and I would urge you to encourage suckler farmers to apply before the deadline of  Friday 15 May. <\/p><p>Conscious of the cash flow pressures on farms at present, I have brought forward &euro;26m in GLAS payments by a month, and these funds were paid recently.  Balancing payments to participants in the Organic Farming Scheme have also been brought forward. I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves. A range of practical flexibilities have been introduced in departmental schemes, including, for example, the extension of completion deadlines for TAMS by 3 months, and the submission for Nitrates records to the end of June. My Department has also worked to ensure that the supply chain continues to function. Critical state services in dairy and meat processing plants continue to function so that farmers have an outlet for their produce, a protocol has been developed for the continued operation of marts, albeit on a limited basis, and the critical certification and other services required to support exports of live animals and products continue to operate. <\/p><p>My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agrifood sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector.

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980&rsquo;s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. <\/p>  <p>  A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by my Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged. The Department also appointed Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project. A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that, while the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that it is classified as &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo;, this classification means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost.  <\/p>  <p>   Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. It is my Department&rsquo;s view that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken and, for illustration purposes, this was equated to an estimated 20,000-30,000 possible truck movements. It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.<\/p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project, including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. <\/p>  <p>The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works.

These works are required as part of an overall planning application submission and it remains my Department&rsquo;s intention to lodge a planning application for the Howth Dredging project in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300127#WRVV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":2671,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300127#WRVV02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2672,"qnumday":942,"qnumall":"[5242\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300127#WRVV02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has engaged with the European Commission on the need to introduce a private storage aid scheme for the dairy sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":2673,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware of the issues presented to the agrifood sector in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

The purpose of my engagement with him has been to highlight the economic impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our agrifood sector, as well as the need to have a strong European response to deal with the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  At this extremely difficult time, the protection of human life and health is vital, and is a shared priority amongst my European colleagues. However, it is also clear that the crisis is likely to impose significant economic impacts, including for the agriculture sector. In this regard, I welcome the measures introduced by the Commission to date to support the sector, including the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative, the temporary State Aid framework and the payment flexibilities provided for under the current CAP regulations.  However, I believe a more extensive, specific response targeted at the agriculture sector is required.  <\/p>  <p>  I wrote to Commissioner Wojciechowski in early March, and again in early April, urging him to consider the implementation of support measures under the Common Organisation of the Market (CMO) Regulation.  In between, on 25 March, I took part in a video-conference meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers with the Commissioner and took the opportunity to highlight the potential economic impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector.  I again urged the Commissioner to consider the deployment of market support measures, and called for further flexibilities to be shown in relation to CAP Pillar I and Pillar II payments.  I subsequently reinforced these messages in a one-to-one video conference call with the Commissioner on Wednesday 15 April.   <\/p>  <p>  Throughout this time, I also engaged with my European colleagues to seek a strong, shared EU response, following which I secured the participation of every single Member State in a strong Joint Statement calling for a common European response to a pan-European problem, which my officials submitted to the Commissioner's office on Thursday 16 April.  <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that after this strong show of European solidarity the Commission swiftly announced a programme of support for the sector including Aids for Private Storage for the meat and dairy sector, and flexibilities with regard to control measures and scheme implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  I intend to continue a sustained engagement at the highest level with the European Commission on this matter. In that regard, I have again spoken personally to Commissioner Wojciechowski on 7 May to highlight the need for an ongoing focus on the challenges to the sector at this time, and the continued requirement for a strong, common approach at European level. I will stress this point further at the video conference of European Agriculture Ministers with the Commissioner on 13 May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300127#WRVV03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme","counter":2683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300127#WRVV03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2684,"qnumday":946,"qnumall":"[5266\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300127#WRVV03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications made under the young farmer scheme since it was introduced by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":2685,"content":"<p>The Young Farmers Scheme was introduced in 2015.

There was a positive and constructive engagement, with a broad consensus from industry representatives, including inshore fisheries representatives, that aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels should be the priority, enabling some vessels to tie-up, while others fished to meet market demands.  <\/p><p>Following my engagement with representatives of fishermen, I announced on 8 May a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme for fishing vessels in the Polyvalent, Beam Trawl and Specific segments of the fleet,<i><\/i>to be<i><\/i>implemented under Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20, co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme will be operational from 1 June and will be available to the inshore fleet and to larger vessels.  It will allow vessel owners to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months over the period June to August.  The Scheme will support the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and is designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.  The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme are outlined in the table below and range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres, to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Size of vessel<\/th>       <th>Payment over 1-month tie-up period<\/th>       <th>Payment over 2-month tie-up period<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Size of vessel<\/td>       <td>Payment over 1-month tie-up period<\/td>       <td>Payment over 2-month tie-up period<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 24m<\/td>       <td>&euro;6,000<\/td>       <td>&euro;12,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>18 &amp;lt; 24m<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,600<\/td>       <td>&euro;9,200<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>15 &amp;lt; 18m<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,000<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12 &amp;lt; 15m<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,900<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,800<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10 &amp;lt; 12m<\/td>       <td>&euro;800<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,600<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>8 &amp;lt; 10m<\/td>       <td>&euro;750<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>6 &amp;lt; 8m<\/td>       <td>&euro;500<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;6m<\/td>       <td>&euro;500<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,000<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>In order to underpin the Government&rsquo;s policy of ensuring that the food chain is maintained and to maintain an essential presence in our markets, the Scheme will be available to a maximum of 66% of the fishing fleet, in the different size categories, in any one month.

These measures will complement the ongoing work of my Department in developing a National Clean Air Strategy, which will set out and give effect to clean air policies in order to meet national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.<\/p><p>As stated above, other key control measures to reduce indoor air pollution fall outside my own remit. For example, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for policy and legislation in relation to building standards and ventilation for both residential and commercial dwellings,  and sets appropriate standards regarding ventilation, heating appliances and materials used. <\/p><p>Another factor that influences indoor air quality, particularly in homes, is of course, smoking.

With respect to an objective on increasing accessibility and social inclusion, it is a requirement that the project appraisal set out and account for the expected impacts of the proposed transport investment in respect of vulnerable groups, this encompasses persons with disabilities. <\/p><p>In evaluating and prioritising investment, it is a requirement to identify the need for a scheme and to outline its objectives. For transport projects, the objectives must fall under six main criteria.  In relation to the equality impact of transport investments, one of these is &lsquo;Accessibility and Social Inclusion&rsquo;. This refers to a transport scheme&rsquo;s ability to impact upon a community&rsquo;s access to services and social amenities.  These criteria form the high level criteria for appraising the expected benefits and impact of the scheme. Sponsoring agencies preparing business cases for transport schemes are required to consider and assess if any accessibility impacts for the general public and in particular, vulnerable groups&mdash;either positive or negative&mdash;are likely to arise as a result of the investment. Such vulnerable groups include, for example, those experiencing social deprivation, geographic isolation, physical or intellectual  impairment. It is required that, to the extent that is possible, the scale of the anticipated impacts is set out within the appraisal, along with the specific groups likely to be impacted and how many people in those groups are likely to be impacted. <\/p><p>In respect of the requirements outlined above, I also note that the Strategic Research and Analysis Division in my Department is currently undertaking a work programme to review, update and improve the Departments existing sectoral guidance (the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes 2016).  This review and update will reflect the new requirements for evaluating, planning and measuring public investment as set out in the recently revised Public Spending Code published at the end of 2019. It also includes an examination of current approaches to measuring the impacts of projects or service changes to identify improvements that can be made. I expect that an updated Common Appraisal Framework will be published in the second half of 2020. <\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Public Sector Duty, as provided for in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, places a legal obligation on all public bodies, including<i><\/i>all central government departments, to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees and everyone affected by their functions and services. <\/p><p>To meet our Public Sector Duty, my Department has established an implementation group which is carrying out an assessment to identify human rights and equality issues, including disability issues that are relevant to the functions of my Department, as a policy maker, employer and service provider. The assessment will also identify the policies and practices that are in place, or any additional measures that may be required to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2973,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 1047  to 1050, inclusive, answered with Question No. 1045.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":2974,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2975,"qnumday":1051,"qnumall":"[4581\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide a schedule of the sites and buildings Irish Rail has disposed of to the private market and to the State in the past 20 years in tabular form; the revenues raised per disposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2976,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for CI&Eacute;, in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to CI&Eacute; for direct reply. <\/p><p>Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2977,"content":"<p>Question No. 1052 answered with Question No. 1045.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2978,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":2979,"qnumday":1053,"qnumall":"[4708\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost to the Vote of his Department if the rate of employer PRSI was increased to 15.75% for the portion of salaries over &euro;100,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2980,"content":"<p>The estimated cost to the vote of my Department if the rate of employer PRSI was increased to 15.75% for the portion of salaries over &euro;100,000 is <b>&euro;135,000. <\/b>This is inclusive of the Agencies under my Department's remit which are exchequer funded. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2981,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2982,"qnumday":1054,"qnumall":"[4866\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300132#WRCCC02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to ensure all transport workers are provided with hand sanitisers (details supplied).","asker":"1569","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2983,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

Ensuring that this fund is appropriately accounted for, and that as many children as possible benefit from it, is one of the core responsibilities of my Department. Pobal administers the beneficiary funding element on behalf of my Department and ensures good governance and strong compliance with the rules of the schemes. <\/p><p>Subsidies for all ELC and SAC programmes are based on child attendance, a key governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. Where, during a compliance visit, Pobal discovers that the actual attendance of a child does not match that child&rsquo;s registration on Pobal&rsquo;s Programme Implementation Platform (PIP, Pobal's IT system), the service will be advised to make the necessary corrections to registrations to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct. An appropriate amount of flexibility is applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case-by-case basis in this regard.<\/p><p>CCS rules have been updated in recent years to clearly link funding to actual attendance during a snapshot period. This reflects the importance of safeguarding Exchequer finances and brought this scheme in line with the other schemes offered by my Department, which are also linked to child attendance. <\/p><p>My officials and Pobal actively monitor services&rsquo; compliance with scheme rules, potential recoupment and the impact of this activity on a service's sustainability. This includes regular reporting on compliance findings, including potential recoupments due to non-compliance.

These figures provide an estimate of the value of the changes to PIP registrations on CCS required as a result of compliance activity. Since CCS funding for the programme year was set by attendance during this snapshot period, these are annualised figures.<\/p><p>Where an overclaim is identified, services are required to make corrections to PIP registrations and future funding is adjusted to ensure that the overall level of funding provided across the year is correct. Funding is based on attendance during a snapshot period, and any overclaim is looked at on an annual basis. As a result, the annualised overclaim consists of two parts: the amount overpaid up to the point of the compliance visit and therefore recouped; and the potential overclaim amount that would have occurred had it not been corrected for the period after the compliance visit. The overclaims identified figures provided above are the combination of the two. Funding payments are made in instalments and corrections can be made at various times during the year. <\/p><p>It should be noted that, where services were required to make corrections to their CCS registrations, they had the opportunity to reregister children onto CCSP. CCSP offers the same rate of subvention as CCS did, but allows for a greater degree of flexibility for service providers and parents. It allows for the level of attendance registered on PIP to be adjusted throughout the year to reflect the ongoing pattern of attendance. The availability of this option ensured that services would not lose out in instances where children under-attended during the snapshot window but later began to attend at a higher level. It also means that a portion of the overclaims identified (as shown in the table above) is likely not to have materialised, since a child could be moved off CCS and onto CCSP, thus ending the overclaim on CCS. <\/p><p>Pobal have calculated that a total of 3,144 registrations required updating following a compliance visit on CCS for the 2018\/19 programme cycle. As previously outlined, services are required to update registrations when the registered level on PIP differs from the actual pattern of attendance of the child. The figures supplied do not indicate a scenario where children had hours reduced; rather they count instances where CCS registrations needed updating in order to match actual attendance during the snapshot period. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the compliance activity should not result in any child having any service withdrawn, rather it strives to ensure that the service provider only claims from my Department for the hours the child is attending. Data available to my Department shows that the number of children accessing Government subsidies continues to increase. <\/p><p>While CCS has been closed, CCSP will continue to operate for the foreseeable future for any children that were registered before 15th November 2019. CCSP is now closed to new entrants families can avail of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).<\/p><p>The NCS has marked another significant milestone for ELC and SAC in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. The NCS enables Government to annually \/ incrementally build investment until it gets to target levels. The NCS enables Government to target this funding as it becomes available at particular groups, or indeed universally. The NCS is also a more user friendly system for parents and providers and the compliance regime has been designed to reflect the real-life attendance of children, the flexibility required, balanced against the continued need to protect Exchequer funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300133#WRDDD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":3081,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300133#WRDDD05500"},{"type":"question","counter":3082,"qnumday":1088,"qnumall":"[3983\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300133#WRDDD05600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her policy plans to allow for the number of ECCE hours that a child is eligible to receive to be contingent upon the attendance of the child at their ECCE service.","asker":"1484","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3083,"content":"<p>The number of ECCE hours that a child is eligible to receive is contingent upon the attendance of the child at their ECCE service.<\/p>  <p>  Since September 2018, all children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months are eligible for two full programme years on the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.

Investment in ELC and SAC has increased by 141% over the last five years.  However, I acknowledge that more investment will be needed.  Historic under-investment in early learning and care has created a situation that has no quick solution. <\/p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation that has required a series of emergency responses from the Government. I am acutely aware of the particular impact this has had on ELC and SAC providers, practitioners, parents and children. I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. <\/p><p>As a direct response to the COVID-19 closure of ELC and SAC services, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) which is a very significant measure to support the sector. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: <\/p><p>- to support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; <\/p><p>- to provide parents with a reassurance that if their ELC and SAC provider signs up to the scheme, they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, and they will maintain their ELC \/ SAC place when services resume and<\/p><p>- to give Early Learning and Care practitioners security and to retain these vital Educators in the sector.<\/p><p>The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. <\/p><p>Before COVID-19, a number of schemes and supports were available or in development to support more accessible, affordable and high quality ELC and SAC. The new National Childcare Scheme established a sustainable platform to enable us to continue investing for years to come.  The Scheme is designed to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.<\/p><p>Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.<\/p><p>I have been doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for ELC professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families. I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. When this process commences, I will be happy to work with trade unions to ensure that pay rates are appropriate in the sector. During the COVID-19 period, I have developed the TWSCS to directly support wages in the sector and protect the continuity of this valued and skilled workforce. <\/p><p>Overall, Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in ELC and SAC. Additional investment of &euro;63.6m will bring spending to &euro;638m in 2020, as noted a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve. Specifically in Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the Sustainability and Sectoral Employment Order Support Fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum. <\/p><p>In terms of policy approaches, my Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028<\/i>. Three specific projects I would draw your attention to under First 5 are the development of a new Funding Model for the sector, the Workforce Development Plan, and the reform of the regulatory and inspection regimes. <\/p><p>A key vehicle to ensure that significant additional investment in the sector delivers for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model. This new Funding Model will provide mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ELC and SAC providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, quality and inclusion in their services.<\/p><p>An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC was announced in September 2019 and commenced its work in October 2019.  The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes to:<\/p><p>- Agree a set of guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC<\/p><p>- Review the existing approach to funding ELC and SAC services by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its alignment with the guiding principles as well as effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage<\/p><p>- Drawing on international evidence, identify and consider options on how additional funding for ELC and SAC could be structured to deliver on the guiding principles and above policy objectives<\/p><p>- Agree a final report including a proposed design for a new Funding Model, with accompanying costings, risk analysis and mitigation and phased implementation plan (with funding likely to become available on an incremental basis) to recommend to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and ultimately Government.<\/p><p>The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding and quality; economics; and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments which will be involved in implementing the new Funding Model. A research partner, Frontier Economics, has been appointed to support the work of the Expert Group.<\/p><p>A consultation and engagement process to take account of the voices of providers, practitioners, parents and other stakeholders within the sector had to be postponed due to COVID-19 but will be commencing shortly. Further information on the Funding Model and its progress is available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie<\/p><p>First 5 also includes a commitment to establishing a Workforce Development Plan for the ELC and SAC sector which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. As part of this, an extensive consultation with the sector is planed to discuss a wide array of working conditions including pay.<\/p><p>Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff, whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for SAC which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.<\/p><p>Finally, under First 5 we have also committed to reform the ELC and SAC regulatory and inspection systems. This will include consideration of options for reforms to the registration and inspection of the sector to ensure a proportionate inspection regime and a more integrated approach to ELC and SAC.<\/p><p>My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment for children, families and our much valued ELC and SAC workforce and ensure that, when COVID- 19 has passed, we will have retained as many services, staff and places as possible and that we are moving progressively towards the vision outlined in First 5 which was unanimously welcomed by all stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300134#WREEE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":3113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300134#WREEE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":3114,"qnumday":1099,"qnumall":"[4192\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300134#WREEE01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of refuge spaces available for victims of domestic violence and families affected by domestic violence; the location of each; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3115,"content":"<p>The response to Domestic, Sexual Violence and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) is a cross Departmental and multi-agency issue.

On this basis, the number of applications to register a new service received up to the end of 2019 was 142, with the number of reported cessations for the same period standing at 196.

I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this, DCYA has introduced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) to support the childcare sector during the closure period. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme was launched on 15 April. The TWSCS operates in conjunction with the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which is expected to last up to 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.    <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme is threefold: <\/p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; <\/p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; and<\/p>  <p>  - to give members of the ELC and SAC workforce security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  To achieve this there are three key elements to the new Scheme: <\/p>  <p>  (i) In addition to the wage subsidy provided by Revenue&rsquo;s TWSS, DCYA is topping-up wages of eligible ELC and SAC staff by the maximum additional payment an employer can make to receive full wage subsidy under the Revenue and DCYA schemes combined, to a limit of &euro;586 weekly pay in line with the Revenue scheme. <\/p>  <p>  (ii) Where a staff member&rsquo;s pre-12 March weekly wage was below the DEASP set rate for temporary Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP; currently &euro;350 per week), DCYA is, on a temporary basis, providing funding to be used to top-up eligible employees&rsquo; wages to the DEASP rate set for the PUP, meaning that all staff are encouraged to remain with their employer rather than sign on with the DEASP.  <\/p>  <p>  (iii) To reflect the unique circumstances of the sector, in addition to funding eligible staff wages up to the maximum additional payment an employer can make to receive the full wage subsidy under the Revenue and DCYA schemes combined up to the cap, services are receiving a further payment which is based on a percentage of their total eligible staff gross weekly pay to be used towards ongoing \/ non-deferrable operational costs<\/p>  <p>  To date, three preliminary TWSCS payments have been made under the scheme on 24 April, 1 May and 8 May to all providers who had signed up the scheme and backdated to 6 April. Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by ELC and SAC providers. Prior to the introduction of the scheme, DCYA had continued to fund childcare providers under the existing subsidy schemes, including ECCE (free pre-school) and the National Childcare Scheme on an ex-gratia basis to 10 April.  Funding under these schemes has now been suspended. <\/p>  <p>  It was important to move to this new temporary funding model to support as many of the 4500 services as possible, not just those in receipt of significant State funding under the beneficiary schemes. The TWSCS repurposes existing ELC and SAC monies to layer on top of the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and to support the multiplicity of ELC and SAC provider types with varying ratios of State income and parental contribution.  <\/p>  <p>  By 10 May  over 3,700 childcare services, 82% of the total number, had signed up the TWSCS.  The scheme remains open for late entrants.<\/p>  <p>  Administration of the scheme is being managed by Pobal.  DCYA has issued comprehensive FAQs on the scheme to providers and their representative bodies. The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the early education and childcare sector. <\/p>  <p>  Expert advice and support is available generally to services across the country through the 30 City and County Childcare Committees, Pobal and a number of funded Childcare Organisations.  The Department continues to work intensively with the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":3186,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":3187,"qnumday":1123,"qnumall":"[5102\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she is satisfied with the management of the allegations outlined in an article (details supplied).","asker":"1484","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3188,"content":"<p>Thank you for asking this very important question about the standard of care provided to a child in foster care.

The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and hence cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff. I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average pay is influenced by the level of a practitioner&rsquo;s qualifications. For example, the average pay rates for graduate workers is somewhat higher than for others working in the sector. Practitioners with Level 5 and Level 6 qualifications earned an average of &euro;11.42 and &euro;12.63 respectively in 2019. The average rates of pay for graduates at that time were &euro;13.93 for those with qualifications at Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications, &euro;13.45 for those with Level 8 qualifications, and &euro;15.18 for those with qualifications at Levels 9 or 10. Overall, the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare was &euro;12.55, which was 3% higher than the year before. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare, resulting in a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families. First 5 recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;. First 5 includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce, and last year I began a process of developing a Workforce Development Plan to achieve this and other workforce-related commitments in First 5.<\/p>  <p>  Delivering on a further commitment in First 5, last year I also appointed an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. <\/p>  <p>  I have actively encouraged the sector to seek a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO). An SEO must be initiated by a grouping representing the sector and my Department is ready to input to such a process, if and when the sector seeks it. Organisations requesting the commencement of such a process must show they are substantially representative of the sector. An SEO would provide for mandatory terms and conditions in the early learning and care and school age childcare sector, minimum rates of remuneration, and other conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in continuous professional development (CPD).<\/p>  <p>  In terms of measures specifically targeted towards higher qualified staff, a Higher Capitation payment is offered within the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme. This additional capitation is paid to contracted services on fulfilling the requirements for graduate-led ECCE sessions. The ECCE Higher Capitation rate is currently equivalent to an additional &euro;11.25 per child per week of the ECCE programme year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":3192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3193,"qnumday":1125,"qnumall":"[5124\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the draft childminding action plan (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3194,"content":"<p>The Draft Childminding Action Plan, which was published for the purpose of public consultation in August 2019, sets out a pathway to achieving Government commitments in <i>First 5.<\/i>Officials in my Department are in the process of analysing the findings from the public consultation process and making revisions to the Draft Childminding Action Plan, with the aim of bringing a revised Childminding Action Plan to Government for approval.<\/p><p>The Draft Childminding Action Plan makes clear that childminding is central to the provision of both early learning and care and school-age childcare in Ireland. For many children in Ireland, a childminder plays a valued role in their early learning and care and overall well-being, often over many years. As the draft plannotes, the research evidence points to positive outcomes for children of quality childminding, which may be linked to consistency of carer and a low child-adult ratio. <\/p><p>I am very aware of the unique nature of a childminding service.

Accordingly, staff employed with funding under Level 7 of AIM are a shared resource for the pre-school room. <\/p>  <p>  The Early Years Services Regulations require that all staff who are employed by an early learning and care provider to work directly with children of pre-school age must hold, at a minimum, a major award at level 5 on the NFQ in Early Childhood Care and Education or a qualification deemed equivalent by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The December 2016 amendment to the Regulations (S.I. no.632 of 2016) provided for exceptional cases in which an exemption from the Level 5 requirement may be made in the context of AIM. An example of a relevant situation is where a child with complex healthcare needs requires specialised health supports, such as nursing, in order to attend the pre-school. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the independent statutory regulator of pre-school services, has published a Quality and Regulatory Framework (QRF), which specifies how the Regulations will be interpreted by the Early Years Inspectorate.

An exemption may be granted by Pobal where it is considered that such specialist support is required and this may detail the qualification requirements or relevant specialist training of the staff member involved.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":3198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3199,"qnumday":1127,"qnumall":"[5184\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of child sexual abuse reports received in each of the years 2016 to 2019; the number referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the number deemed unfounded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3200,"content":"<p>The Deputy is asking about an operational matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

It aims to support children with disabilities to access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE universal pre-school programme. AIM is a child-centred model that involves seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the early learning and care setting. <\/p>  <p>  AIM's universal measures have supported the development of an inclusive culture in the sector. 97% of registered providers have developed an inclusion policy, and 6,250 participants from 3,000 services have taken part in Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training. <\/p>  <p>  To empower services to promote an inclusive culture in settings, the Leadership in Inclusion (LINC) programme was established  and in the last four years has had over 3,100 registered students. So far 2,230 practitioners have graduated from the LINC programme, of whom more then 1,900 have gone on to be Inclusion Co-Ordinators working in pre-school settings. AIM has also invested in the delivery of continuing professional development courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing e-learning. Currently over 1,100, 800 and 1,425 participants respectively have completed these courses. <\/p>  <p>  Targeted AIM supports focus on the needs of an individual child and over 12,500 children in 3,300 services have benefited from targeted AIM supports since 2016. These supports range from assistive equipment, to therapeutic supports and to additional assistance in the pre-school room.  <\/p>  <p>  AIM has won awards both at home and internationally. It has won a Civil Service Excellence Award, and most recently won an international award for innovative policy at this year&rsquo;s UN Zero Project Awards, in recognition of the programme&rsquo;s significant contribution to the inclusion of children with disabilities. The Zero Project focuses on the rights of persons with disabilities globally. AIM was one of 11 innovative policies selected from 465 policy submissions from around the globe. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has committed to conducting an end-of-year-three evaluation of the model. The evaluation shall, having regard to all levels of AIM, ascertain the impact and effectiveness of AIM from the perspective of all stakeholders &ndash; investigating insofar as possible outcomes, efficacy, efficiency, adaptability and sustainability. This evaluation is currently in the procurement phase. <\/p>  <p>  A whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families, First 5, commits to continue to roll out AIM to ensure the full inclusion of children with a disability in settings delivering the ECCE programme. As part of the end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM and, subject to evaluation findings and other relevant developments, First 5 commits to consideration of enhancements to, and\/or extension of, AIM to, for example, all early learning and care services, all school-age childcare services and\/or to children with additional needs other than a disability. Consideration will be given to this commitment following completion of the evaluation of AIM. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":3204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":3205,"qnumday":1129,"qnumall":"[5299\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of protected disclosures her Department has received since the legislation was introduced; the number of protected disclosures examined to conclusion by year in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3206,"content":"<p>My Department is currently collating the data required  I will correspond directly with the Deputy on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Offices","counter":3207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":3208,"qnumday":1130,"qnumall":"[5491\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if there are vacancies in the offices of her Department at a location (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3209,"content":"<p>My Department offices are situated in Dublin and there are no offices in the locations mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":3211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme","counter":3210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":3211,"qnumday":1131,"qnumall":"[5175\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300135#WRFFF03600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"when funding will be made available to local authorities in respect of the local improvement scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1500"},{"type":"speech","counter":3212,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme, or LIS, is a programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas which are not under the normal maintenance of the Local Authorities.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that any future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy.<\/p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.  People are living longer and healthier lives.  Many of them may want to continue working after 65 and these resources can facilitate them in their choice.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.

These include the Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) which encompasses the following four grants:<\/p><p>1. Employee Retention Grant <\/p><p>2. Workplace Equipment \/ Adaptation Grant <\/p><p>3. Personal Reader Grant <\/p><p>4. Job Interview Interpreter Grant <\/p><p>The purpose of the Workplace Equipment\/Adaptation Grant (WEAG) is to increase job opportunities for people with a disability by supporting any additional costs, related to the disability, incurred by private sector employers employing or retaining an employee with a disability.<\/p><p>The general principles of the scheme are that it:<\/p><p>- applies only to the additional costs of adapting workplace equipment or of the provision of equipment arising from the individual&rsquo;s disability.  It should not be used to provide support usually provided by employers or supports required under legislation for employees who do not have a disability;<\/p><p>- is a contribution towards the cost of an adaptation or of equipment up to a current limit of &euro;6,350.  It can also be used to upgrade adaptive equipment which may have been fundedpreviously.  Application in excess of this sum will be considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for the assistive technology is required;<\/p><p>- is not intended to meet the usual costs of setting up and running a business either for an employer or a self-employed person;<\/p><p>- will be treated as a grant; and<\/p><p>- may be used in part for training in the use of the grant-aided equipment.<\/p><p>Those eligible for receipt include:<\/p><p>- Any person with a disability who is about to take up employment with a private sector employer, change job as a result of re-deployment or promotion, or become self-employed, and who requires assistive technology or an adaptation to the workplace in order to undertake the duties required;<\/p><p>- Any person employed by a private sector employer who acquires a disability whilst in employment, whose employer is participating in the Employee Retention Grant Scheme (ERGS), and who requires assistive technology or an adaptation to the workplace in order to retain his\/her employment;<\/p><p>- Any person with a disability who is employed by a private sector employer, whose condition deteriorates so that he\/she requires new assistive technology or a further adaptation to the workplace in order to retain his\/her employment.<\/p><p>The Community Employment (CE) scheme provides part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities for people in receipt of a long term Social Welfare payment as a stepping stone back to employment.  It is important to note that community employment, does not, nor is it intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.

Firstly, an increase in the age limits could result in a cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible, and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of a social welfare payment it would be difficult to for the Department to estimate the numbers involved. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, some customers could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance, the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment and the Back to Work Family Dividend back to the OFP.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is an important measure that assists pensioners and other welfare dependent householders to address income deficiency, especially during the winter when a household faces increased heating needs.  The duration of the scheme is designed to coincide with the coldest periods of the year and it is for this reason the scheme runs from October to mid-April. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the COVID-19 emergency, the Government has already allocated c. &euro;2.4 billion in a package of social protection measures.  For example, enhanced Illness Benefit is available for employees or self-employed people who are medically required to self isolate or medically diagnosed with Covid-19.  The personal rate of Illness Benefit has increased from &euro;203 per week to &euro;350 per week for such persons and the 6 day waiting period has been removed making payment available from the first certified day of illness.  In addition to this, the normal social welfare conditionality requirements for access to Illness Benefit do not apply to these employees.  Furthermore, self-employed persons who would not normally be able to access Illness Benefit will also be in a position to receive this income support.  These measures will enable self-employed people or other workers who do not have the necessary social insurance history to receive the increased payment without having to undergo a means test. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the above measures, I was delighted to announce on the 31st March that, in order to support vulnerable households during the COVID-19 emergency, especially at this time where the Government wishes people to stay at home to stay safe, the fuel season will be extended by four weeks for existing eligible customers on a once-off basis.<\/p>  <p>  This extends the payment of &euro;24.50 per week to c. 373,570 households from Friday 10 April (when it was due to expire) until Friday 8 May 2020 and will provide these vulnerable households with additional targeted financial supports in a timely, efficient and time bound manner.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the extension of the fuel allowance season, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances.  Exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet from his \/ her own resources. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300138#WRJJJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Working Family Payment Payments","counter":3400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300138#WRJJJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":3401,"qnumday":1197,"qnumall":"[4992\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300138#WRJJJ00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the working family payment will continue to be paid to families even if there is a reduction in their working hours.","asker":"1560","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3402,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to playing its part in the overall Government, and indeed national, response to the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The report found that only a few Member States have adopted legislation related to the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo; and that there is a lack of consensus about the need for legislation in the area and how it should be regulated.<\/p><p>The topic was also discussed at the most recent Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF), following which I wrote to ICTU and IBEC seeking submissions in order to contribute to the debate.  <\/p><p>Officials in the Department of Justice and Equality have also conducted a public consultation on the broader theme of developing a national flexible working policy.  The policy will take into account the needs of families, individuals, employers and the broader economy.  The results of the consultation are currently being analysed and I look forward to its publication. <\/p><p>In December 2019, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published the 'Remote Work in Ireland' Report.  The report focussed on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements.  It identified the need for further guidance for employers to support the adoption of remote work across a number of areas, including the right to disconnect.  The WRC is the primary source of information on employment rights in Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department continuously monitors existing employment rights legislation to ensure that it continues to be relevant and fit for purpose.  My officials will continue to do so in relation to the right to disconnect and will strive to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the exigencies of businesses, organisations and workers.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300138#WRJJJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Payments","counter":3425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300138#WRJJJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":3426,"qnumday":1206,"qnumall":"[5272\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300138#WRJJJ03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3427,"content":"<p>Working Family Payment (WFP) formerly known as Family Income Supplement , is a weekly tax free payment which provides additional income support to employees on low earnings with children.<\/p><p>The person concerned is currently in receipt of WFP at a rate of &euro;180 per week.

Responsibility for the provision of emergency accommodation and related services for homeless persons is a matter for the local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the response to COVID-19, my Department is working closely with the Dublin Regional Homelessness Executive (DRHE), local authorities and the HSE to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place to protect individuals and families accessing emergency accommodation. This has included regular meetings and conference calls with the DRHE, local authorities and the Chief Executives of homeless NGOs. My Department is also working with the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) subgroup for vulnerable persons. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities nationally have been working to put in place additional accommodation to allow for the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.  Significant additional accommodation is also in place to support the appropriate levels of social distancing in emergency accommodation.  In Dublin, where over 70% of all homeless individuals are located, over 1,000 additional beds have been put in place to ensure adherence to HSE guidance, in addition to providing beds for individuals in emergency accommodation who are required to self-isolate.

In order to target SSF funding interventions, local authorities were invited to undertake an economic assessment of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes was necessary and economically viable.  As part of that assessment local authorities were also asked to consider the broader housing affordability within their area.  19 local authorities returned economic assessments to my Department.<\/p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will facilitate the delivery of almost 3,200 more affordable homes.

This legislation now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  <\/p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.<\/p><p>In order to be eligible for affordable dwelling purchase arrangements, a household&rsquo;s income must be such that it is inadequate to meet the repayments on a mortgage for the purchase of a dwelling to meet the accommodation needs of the household, because the payments calculated over the course of a year would exceed 35% per cent of the annual income of the household (net of income tax and pay related social insurance).  Eligibility is also generally limited to first time buyers.  The maximum discount on market value that may be given to an eligible purchaser is 40%.<\/p><p>When a dwelling is made available to a purchaser under an affordable dwelling purchase arrangement a charging order is made by the housing authority.  This places a charge on the dwelling with an amount equal to the difference between the purchase money and the market value of the dwelling. Payments may be made by the purchaser to reduce this amount during the charged period.  The amount outstanding on the charge must be repaid in full at the end of the charged period.<\/p><p>The selling price of discounted dwellings made available for purchase by a housing authority under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will be influenced by a number of factors, particularly the overall development costs of the homes (taking into account subvention inputs such as the local authority land value and Serviced Sites Fund), which can vary significantly from one site to another, the tenure mix involved and the local housing market.<\/p><p>In addition to the SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand.  30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer, with local authorities funding the balance.

Cost Rental is housing where the rents are set at a level to cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. This is different to private sector rentals where rents are set by the market, which may lead to high rents in high demand areas. A core objective of Cost Rental is to offer moderate income households the choice of a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure. Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that Cost Rental will have a stabilising effect on the broader private rental market.

Decisions with regard to the optimum work programme of the Valuation Office, including the selection, sequencing and grouping of rating authority areas for revaluation, are a matter for the independent Commissioner, taking into account the extensive valuation work required in each case and in terms of engaging with ratepayers and other stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme. The objective of the programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years is completed, as soon as possible, on a phased basis. <\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process whereby all rateable properties in a local authority area, rather than in a particular business sector, are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. The statutory provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. Each local authority area is a legal entity in its own right for the purposes of carrying out a revaluation. This requires the application of a separate valuation order and the publication of a new valuation list for each local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides the legislative basis for the local authority budget process. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the total amount of rates to be levied by it in a particular year having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. The size or aggregate value of rateable properties on a valuation list does not determine the total amount of rates to be collected by a local authority and the sequencing of revaluations does not affect this process.<\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The revaluation reflects changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The revaluation programme is not designed to benefit any particular business categories.<\/p>  <p>  Once the first revaluation of all areas is completed, the exercise must be repeated on a recurring basis, with revaluations required no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the previous revaluation. Where frequent revaluations occur on a rolling basis, this ensures equity and uniformity of the entire valuation system which underpins commercial rates. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme has already been completed in respect of the rating authority areas of Carlow, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils and Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council. In keeping with the recurring nature of the Programme, a second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council rating authority area was also completed in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The next phase of the programme, known as &ldquo;Reval 2019&rdquo;, commenced in late 2017 and concluded last year, with the revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in Cavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils. Fingal County Council also underwent a second revaluation having initially been the subject of a Revaluation in 2009. <\/p>  <p>  The latest phase, known as &ldquo;Reval 2021&rdquo;, commenced in late 2019 and will conclude in 2021 with the revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. <\/p>  <p>  The second revaluation of all rateable property in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown rating authority area was due to be finalised this year. However, as it is not possible to complete this exercise under current COVID-19 restrictions, it has recently been agreed with the Commissioner of Valuation that this revaluation will be deferred until next year, in line with the Reval 2021 timeline. An appropriate legislative amendment to underpin this decision will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1554"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Services","counter":3499,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3500,"qnumday":1230,"qnumall":"[4121\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the lighting on Inis O&iacute;rr pier, Aran Islands, County Galway has not been working for several weeks; if a request has been received from Galway County Council for funding in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1578","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3501,"content":"<p>My Department does not allocate specific funding towards the management and maintenance of public lighting as this is a matter for each individual local authority.

It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme this year.  Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process.  Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer, the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended. The funding available must be used prudently to achieve the most efficient and cost effective outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  The defective concrete blocks grant scheme only applies to private dwellings in Donegal and Mayo that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks. In respect of local authority housing stock, section 58 of the Housing Act 1966 provides that the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock is a matter for each individual local authority. This includes maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs.  However, my Department is committed to supporting local authorities in terms of various targeted stock upgrade programmes, including issues arising in the context of defective concrete blocks, large-scale urban regeneration programmes, support for the return of vacant units to productive use, the Energy Retrofitting Programme and adaptations and extensions for people with disability in social housing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Regeneration and Development Fund","counter":3507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK04200"},{"type":"question","counter":3508,"qnumday":1232,"qnumall":"[4159\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the drawdown by each local authority from the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019, in tabular form;

As Minister, I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, the Commissioner is responsible for the provision and maintenance of   a valuation list for each local authority area which is used by the local authority to determine the total amount of rates to be levied by it in a particular year. The provision and maintenance of valuation lists is accomplished using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in the relative value of properties over time.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability across businesses more equitably. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the business rates burden levied by their local authority, relative to the rental value of the property that they occupy. <\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process whereby all rateable properties in a local authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. This can reflect improvements to individual properties, subdivisions and amalgamations of properties, exemptions under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, and the removal of properties from the list when they are no longer capable of beneficial occupation.<\/p>  <p>  The restrictions on the operation of many businesses, the physical inaccessibility to business properties and the social distancing associated with controlling the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on the revision programme.  Accordingly, it is not possible to process revision applications at present; however, this will be kept under review in the context of the implementation of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. <\/p>  <p>  Insofar as revaluation matters are concerned, the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The current phase of the programme, known as Reval 2021, covers the rating authority areas of Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. The new valuations for these local authority areas will be published in September 2021 and will come into effect for rating purposes from 2022 onwards. Ratepayers in these local authority areas are currently paying rates based on valuations which reflect economic conditions in 1988. <\/p>  <p>  For the majority of ratepayers, the outcome of a revaluation is very welcome. For example, across the 8 local authorities most recently revalued (Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils), over 65% of ratepayers saw a reduction in their rates liability after revaluation. This is in line with the outcome of other revaluations conducted to date under the National Revaluation Programme. <\/p>  <p>  The second revaluation of all rateable property in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown rating authority area was due to be finalised this year. However, as it is not possible to complete this exercise under current COVID-19 restrictions, it has recently been agreed with the Commissioner of Valuation that this revaluation will be deferred until next year, in line with the Reval 2021 timeline. An appropriate legislative amendment to underpin this decision will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1510"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Elections","counter":3522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":3523,"qnumday":1237,"qnumall":"[4278\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK05800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of votes cast in the General Election on 8 February 2020 that were deemed invalid due to the fact that ballot papers were not franked; the numbers of such invalid, unfranked papers per constituency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3524,"content":"<p>Electoral law provides that a ballot paper at an election is invalid for a number of reasons: if it does not bear the official mark; does not clearly indicate a first preference for some candidate; indicates a first preference for more than one candidate; or has anything written or marked on it, which in the opinion of the returning officer, is calculated to identify the elector.<\/p><p>The results of the general election held on 8 February 2020 are available on the Oireachtas website at:<\/p><p>Table 4 of the results book includes, by constituency, an analysis of the number of invalid ballot papers, including those that did not bear the official mark. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1510"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3525,"content":"<p>Question No. 1238 answered with Question No. 1231.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3526,"content":"<p>Question No. 1239 answered with Question No. 1214.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Funding","counter":3527,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK06200"},{"type":"question","counter":3528,"qnumday":1240,"qnumall":"[4373\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300139#WRKKK06300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if essential funding will be awarded for works to a group water scheme (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3529,"content":"<p>On 8 February 2019, I announced details of the measures being funded through my Department under the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021.

their plans to provide more affordable housing, land utilisation and activation, including for the delivery of more affordable housing, is, in the first instance, a matter for each local authority and its elected members.  <\/p><p>In relation to the provision of affordable housing, I commenced Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which covers Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, in June 2018.  This now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State.<\/p><p>Under these provisions, I signed regulations in respect of the making of a Scheme of Priority on 12 March 2019, which in turn were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level, and includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  Dublin City Council members agreed the Council's Scheme of Priority in May 2019 and I approved the Scheme in early July 2019. Further affordable housing regulations will be put in place in the months ahead regarding eligibility and other matters.<\/p><p>The regeneration of Poolbeg West is the next logical step in transforming the Docklands area, given its strategic location east of Grand Canal Dock, with close proximity to important bridge connections to Dublin Port and North Lotts.  The extent of vacant available brownfield land in the area is significant, at 34 hectares. <\/p><p>The residential potential within the 34 hectare of available lands, is for a maximum of 3,500 additional residential units at a gross residential density of up to 238 units per hectare on lands over 14.7 hectares to the south of South Bank Road. This estimated housing yield would be sufficient to support a residential population of approximately 8,000 people and, therefore, would make a significant contribution to the city&rsquo;s housing needs. <\/p><p>During the process leading to the adoption of the planning scheme for the Poolbeg West area by the elected members of Dublin City Council, an issue of significant interest was the capacity of this site to assist both in the provision of much needed housing, but also that there would be an increased provision over the statutory 10% of housing units for social and affordable purposes.  This matter was considered both by Dublin City Council in the adoption of the planning scheme and by An Bord Pleanala in the consideration of appeals brought against the scheme adopted by the Council. In their decision of 9 April 2019, An Bord Pleanala modified the SDZ scheme in relation to this matter as follows:<\/p><p>- &ldquo;<i>Prior to commencement of development, subject to confirmed funding and value for money considerations, a commercial agreement shall be entered into between Dublin City Council, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the owners\/developers of the residential element of the Planning Scheme for the delivery of 15% of the residential units approved on the lands included in this Planning Scheme for social and affordable housing purposes. These units shall be additional to the housing provided for social housing purposes as required above<\/i>. (i.e. additional to the 10% social and affordable)&rdquo; <\/p><p>In relation to the wider activation of these lands, it is understood that NAMA is currently undertaking a process to select a preferred bidder to develop the lands in the SDZ scheme area.  My Department remains committed to working with Dublin City Council, any relevant Approved Housing Bodies and either the receiver and\/or developers of the SDZ area in order to secure additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and of the order of magnitude laid out in the adopted planning scheme.  This will be subject to agreement on all the normal and relevant terms, including value for money aspects.<\/p><p>In order to support local authorities in their delivery of affordable homes, the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), which is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable homes, either to buy or rent, can be delivered.  At a maximum amount of &euro;50,000 per home, it is anticipated at least 6,200 more affordable homes can be provided.

It is not designed to replace traditional social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for the Government.

Cost Rental is generally understood as being housing where the rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less any financial supports provided by the State or Local Authorities.  Depending on the nature of the model, Cost Rental lacks the level of profit margin often seen in the private rental sector and the rents are not overtly influenced by market supply and demand. With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, many households on more moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case. Cost Rental will be a new tenure option for Ireland, and is one of several schemes which my Department is pursuing in order to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and provide more affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  The rents for Cost Rental units will naturally be a factor of the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. My Department has identified a number of measures which can be used at the outset of a development in order put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants. These include provision of land at low\/zero cost, a design approach with value engineering and long-term maintenance in mind, a potential State contribution to development costs via the Serviced Sites Fund, and the availability of low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over a long period of time.<\/p>  <p>  The Serviced Sites Fund provides &euro;310 million of support to help deliver more affordable homes. I can confirm that the SSF is available to local authorities to fund initial infrastructure works and so reduce the cost of building homes, which will be either sold under the Affordable Purchase scheme or made available under a Cost Rental scheme. Approved Housing Bodies will be able to access the benefits of SSF funding by working in partnership with Local Authorities.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Cost Rental 'pathfinder' pilots are currently under development that will act as examples of how Cost Rental can operate in practice. The first of these to commence construction is at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside. It consists of 50 Cost Rental homes alongside 105 social housing apartments.

However, the Authority recommended that ballot paper templates (BPTs) be trialled at a future referendum where voters have a simple &lsquo;yes\/no&rsquo; choice, and that the results be monitored and evaluated.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress has been made in recent years to enable visually impaired voters to vote in secret.

The rollout of the BPT was continued at the Presidential election held in October 2018, the European Parliament and local elections held in May 2019 and the General Election held in February 2020.  A BPT is attached to a ballot paper and it consists of raised numbering and corresponding braille to assist the voter in identifying the openings on the template that correspond to the voter preference boxes for the candidates on the ballot paper. It  operates in conjunction with a &lsquo;freephone 1800&rsquo; number.

This study revealed an error rate of just 0.18 per cent.  I understand that it is the PRA&rsquo;s view that this error rate is well within the acceptable range, given the complexity of the project.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am assured by the PRA that it has in place robust procedures whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  The PRA also has a longstanding and valued relationship with solicitors, surveyors, engineers and architects in all matters pertaining to property registration.<\/p>  <p>  The PRA&rsquo;s experience has been such that many of the queries received, once investigated, do not indicate any registration error.  Many of the perceived errors do not emanate from the PRA but, in fact, originate from inaccuracies in the application map lodged for registration.  Responsibility for the accuracy of the application map lodged rests with the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the PRA digital mapping project resolved many thousands of pre-existing issues and anomalies that existed in the paper-based map system. Being proactive in the adoption of Ordnance Survey Ireland topographical detail during digitisation has absolved many property owners of the need to incur costs in an effort to perfect or amend the Land Register to reflect the actual position on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, registrations that are queried involve the retrieval of the original registration documents and maps in order to facilitate a thorough analysis and examination.  On some occasions, there is a necessity to revert to and consult with Irish Land Commission maps and documentation in order to draw a conclusion.  Approximately 50 per cent of the cases reviewed by the PRA result in no change to the registration.  Notwithstanding this, the PRA makes every effort to review each case in as timely a manner as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300140#WRLLL05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1554"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seaweed Harvesting Licences","counter":3590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300140#WRLLL05500"},{"type":"question","counter":3591,"qnumday":1264,"qnumall":"[4641\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300140#WRLLL05600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there is a time limit in place as to when seaweed harvesters can lodge claims for title to cut seaweed in certain areas based on long usage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3592,"content":"<p>A claim to register rights of the kind referred to can be made to the Property Registration Authority (PRA) under Section 49A of the Registration of Title Act 1964.

The registration of such rights is a matter for the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI) and those wishing to register their rights should engage directly with the PRAI. In the context of the potential interaction between existing rights and foreshore licence applications to harvest wild seaweed, my Department has engaged on a number of occasions with the PRAI to ensure a common understanding of the issues involved. <\/p>  <p>  All foreshore licence applicants are required to engage in a pre-application consultation with my Department. At that stage, the requirements around public consultation and all other aspects of the application process are explained.  In addition, applicants in the course of their application, have ongoing contact with my Department, through which clarification is provided on any issues arising in relation to  searches for formal and informal rights.  <\/p>  <p>  Following clarification of the legal position, all applicants have been made aware of my Department&rsquo;s position on the interaction between existing rights and foreshore licence applications to hand harvest seaweed. Applicants are required to engage in a very thorough process of researching where existing rights to harvest seaweed might exist. <\/p>  <p>  No licence applications to harvest wild seaweed have been determined by my Department in the last five years.  All applications for foreshore leases or licences including those to harvest wild seaweed, when deemed complete, are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  During the consultation on the National Marine Planning Framework that concluded recently, it was suggested that a forum on seaweed be established and I will consider this suggestion. Currently, my responsibilities regarding seaweed are limited to the provisions of the 1933 Foreshore Act that do not include either the promotion or economic development of the sector. <\/p>  <p>  As I outlined during a debate on Sustainable Seaweed Harvesting during Dail Private Members' time on 7 March 2018, any regulatory regime cannot focus solely on the sector from one viewpoint. We must take into account the interests of a multiplicity of stakeholders, balancing the existing rights of traditional harvesters with commercial potential, while also ensuring sustainability of the resource and compliance with the State's obligations under domestic and EU environmental law.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the biomass of the wild seaweed resource, funding was secured under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for two seaweed related projects. The first project is focused on seaweed biomass assessments and the other on the socio economic importance of seaweed. The Marine Institute are presently finalising the terms of reference of both projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300140#WRLLL06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":3602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300140#WRLLL06800"},{"type":"question","counter":3603,"qnumday":1267,"qnumall":"[4647\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300140#WRLLL06900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps he plans to take to address the funding shortfall in funding for Galway County Council and Galway City Council as identified in the report of the expert group to examine the amalgamation of Galway city and county councils; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3604,"content":"<p>The Government approved the merger of Galway City Council and Galway County Council on 18 June 2018.

It is important, therefore, that the efforts and resources of the local authorities are focused more significantly on their construction programmes and that they continue to use acquisitions in line with the above approach.  In both 2018 and 2019, the targets for acquisitions of social housing in Galway City have been exceeded. <\/p>  <p>  No directive has issued to Galway City Council to only purchase one-bedroom properties for social housing.  As part of supporting the Council&rsquo;s work to respond to homelessness, particularly through the Housing First programme, the need to target one-bedroom properties for that programme has been discussed by my Department with both Galway authorities and at the Galway Housing Task Force. My Department has also discussed with all local authorities a need to focus acquisitions on other priority situations where, for example, there may be tenants with particular needs, or targeting derelict properties.  Also, acquisitions may arise as part of the strategic delivery of social housing in areas of need, where there may be no other scope for delivery due to, for example, lack of sites or infrastructure issues.  Local authorities can also refer suitable acquisition opportunities to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for consideration as part of their programmes.<\/p>  <p>  In locations where, for example, a new build approach is not possible for social housing delivery, local authorities are encouraged to acquire and refurbish properties that may be derelict or in need of upgrade.

Local authorities are the competent authorities for delivering homes for people living in their functional areas and my Department supports them in this work. Connecting targets to established need is a key element of this work. Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area are set out in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), which has been carried out annually since 2016. The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better inform policy and plan for the delivery of the right types of housing support. The data garnered through the Summary allows the Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to those most in need.<\/p><p>The most recently conducted SSHA details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists as at 24 June 2019 (the count date) and shows that 68,693 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the previous assessment in June 2018. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%. <\/p><p>The SSHA provides local authorities with information about current demand for social housing. It is also important that local authorities are aware of, and planning for, the potential future demand for social housing when they are preparing their Housing Strategies as part of their Development Plan process. To this end, National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework requires that each local authority should undertake a &quot;Housing Need and Demand Assessment&quot; for their area.

The Guidelines, however, also provide scope for densities below 35 dph on more peripheral sites in smaller towns and villages, in particular to assist in delivering more sustainable alternatives to dispersed urban-generated rural houses.<\/p><p>Given that individual county development plans prioritise key towns, including county towns and many larger towns, for future development with significant population growth targets, achieving densities of 35 dph and over is important. Not achieving such densities means that such towns will become even more spread out and car dependent, with negative implications for tackling climate change and for promoting and sustaining public transport systems or even for the provision of cycling and walking networks.<\/p><p>Moreover, achieving densities of at least 35 dph is essential in catering for the more diverse range of smaller households presenting today, including couples who may wish to downsize, creating the flexibility for households to stay in their neighbourhoods\/towns as their housing requirements change.

If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.

and in relation to discoveries of archaeological objects generally, are set out in the National Monuments Acts.  While it is unlawful to be in possession of, or to use, a detection device on any monument site protected under those Acts without Ministerial consent under section 2 of the 1987 National Monuments (Amendment) Act, such consent is only otherwise needed where the device is being used for the express purpose of searching for archaeological objects.  <\/p>  <p>  I do want to emphasise, however, that unregulated and inappropriate use of metal detectors causes serious and irreparable damage to Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage.  Unsupervised recovery of archaeological objects can greatly diminish, and could entirely eliminate, any research value that might be gained from a particular discovery.  Archaeological objects must be excavated in a structured scientific manner, with careful recording of their association with other objects, structures, features and soil layers.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the Deputy would support me in wanting to retain a system where important cultural heritage material is subject to an appropriate protection regime, that archaeological objects found in the State belong to the people and are not liable to fall into private ownership, and that he would back the current statutory safeguards rather than seeking to introduce changes that would be inappropriate to the circumstances as they exist in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I consider the present legislative framework, and the manner in which it is implemented, to be reasonable, proportionate and essential to preventing irreparable loss and damage to our national heritage. Therefore, I have no proposals at present to make any changes to the law as it applies to the use of metal detecting devices. However, my Department is in contact with the organisation referred to by the Deputy and will be responding to any proposals they have put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sc&eacute;imeanna Teanga","counter":3754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3755,"qnumday":1324,"qnumall":"[4651\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach n-&iacute;octar ach ar feadh seachtaine na mn&aacute; t&iacute; a choinn&iacute;onn scol&aacute;ir&iacute; faoin sc&eacute;im speisialta scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; ag freastal ar na me&aacute;nscoileanna ar na hoile&aacute;in i gc&aacute;s go mb&iacute;onn scol&aacute;ire as l&aacute;thair de bharr breoiteachta; c&eacute;n costas breise a bhainfeadh leis seo a sh&iacute;neadh ar feadh m&iacute;osa; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1575","askee":"1472"},{"type":"speech","counter":3756,"content":"<p>Faoin tionscnamh seo, cuirtear ciste ar f&aacute;il ar fi&uacute; suas le &euro;150,000 thar tr&eacute;imhse 3 bliana chun gur f&eacute;idir le suas le 30 scol&aacute;ire iar-bhunscoile in aghaidh na bliana scoilbhliain ioml&aacute;n a chaitheamh ag freastal ar aon cheann den tr&iacute; iar-bhunscoil ar na hoile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann.<\/p><p>T&aacute; scoil iar-bhunoideachais ar gach ceann d&rsquo;Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann: Col&aacute;iste Naomh &Eacute;inne, Inis M&oacute;r, Col&aacute;iste Ghobnait, Inis O&iacute;rr, agus Col&aacute;iste Naomh Eoin, Inis Me&aacute;in.

Shorelines absorb and attenuate the energy entering the coastal zone, thereby acting as natural coastal defences. Material that is eroded from one section of the coast accumulates in another, such that the contours of the coastline are constantly in a state of change. Coastal habitats and species protected by special areas of conservation are adapted to survive and depend upon these unstable conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  Because coastal habitats and species are dependent on natural erosion and accretion, they can be damaged either directly or indirectly when coastal protection structures are put in place.  Furthermore, interference with natural, dynamic coastal processes (by trying to slow down or stop them) can sometimes invite further instability and increased rates of damage to land and property in the area concerned. The construction of physical barriers such as sea defences can interrupt longshore drift, leading to beach starvation and increased rates of erosion in adjacent areas.  Therefore, care must be taken to consider fully the effects of any response to erosional events. <\/p>  <p>  Implementation of coastal defences through engineering is not part of my Department&rsquo;s remit. Natural erosion rates can be increased by human impacts such as climate change and recreation, and these factors should be taken into account when considering an appropriate response.

Recorded monuments are protected under Section 12 of the 1994 National Monuments (Amendment) Act and two months&rsquo; notice is required to be given to my Department in advance of works at, or in, their vicinity.  <\/p>  <p>  I regret that in current circumstances, and in light of the limited resources available for new acquisitions, this particular monument could not at present be regarded as a priority for being taken into state care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":3788,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05200"},{"type":"question","counter":3789,"qnumday":1336,"qnumall":"[5428\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if it will be ensured that artists, arts workers and organisations can plan for next year by guaranteeing that at least the same level of increased investment in the Arts Council and Culture Ireland will be committed for 2021.","asker":"1478","askee":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":3790,"qnumday":1337,"qnumall":"[5429\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if a roadmap will be created in order to address the way in which arts investment will be doubled by 2025; and if a commitment will be given to double investment in the Arts Council and Culture Ireland over the same period.","asker":"1478","askee":"1472"},{"type":"speech","counter":3791,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1336 and 1337 together.<\/p><p>The COVID-19 crisis gives rise to many challenges for the nation as a whole and is having an unprecedented impact on the on the arts, culture, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors.  The full financial and economic implications of the crisis are not yet known, as further information continues to come to hand and having regard to the fact that the impact on the sectors supported by the Department could extend well past the lifting of any COVID-19 restrictions.  <\/p><p>Since the advent of the crisis, officials from my Department have been actively engaging with the arts sector and have met and continue to meet with arts and cultural organisations under its aegis, as well a broad range of sectorial stakeholders including resource organisations, advocacy groups as well as individual artists and arts practices<\/p><p>In the context of the wider cultural sector, officials of my Department have met and continues to meet with the State Bodies under its aegis.  The  Department is continuing to work with the Arts Council and Screen Ireland as well as other parts of Government, to assess and measure the effects of COVID-19 on the cultural sector and continue to plan how best to manage through this crisis.  A number of measures have been taken to date to support this sector by the Department and its agencies.<\/p><p>My Department and the Arts Council are providing detailed advice for arts and arts organisations on their websites.  Priority is being given towards supporting the artists and arts workers.<\/p><p>The Arts Council responded quickly to the impact of COVID-19 on the arts sector. At the start of the COVID-19 emergency, the Council introduced a series of measures to help artists and arts organisations manage their businesses during the period of the COVID-19 crisis.  These can be accessed on its website at the following link: <\/p><p>These measures include honouring all existing funding commitments and asking regularly funded arts organisation to prioritise their own payments to artists in turn. Since March 12th the Arts Council has fast-tracked the payment of up to 90% of funding to organisations and individuals. <\/p><p>The Arts Council has announced that there will be no financial penalties for arts organisations and individuals unable to deliver programmed events and activities arising from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p><p>The Arts Council is in daily contact with a broad range of artists and organisations to understand how COVID-19 is impacting the sector. The Council continues to operate fully throughout the COVID-19 crisis to support artists and arts organisations through this difficult time. Regular updates are being provided on its website and its social media channels.<\/p><p>The Council has also undertaken detailed surveys of arts organisations to get a deep understanding of how COVID-19 is impacting the arts sector. This is helping to identify the impact on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May as well as a survey of artists seeking information of the economic impact on individuals. .<\/p><p>With regards to Culture Ireland, a new grant scheme was announced in early April, to support professional artists and enable the live presentation of their work on online platforms for an initial period of 4 weeks. Funding of &euro;100,000 has being made available on a match funded basis by FACEBOOK Ireland and Culture Ireland, a division of the Department. All successful artists have been awarded &euro;1,000. The scheme is being managed by Culture Ireland in conjunction with First Music Contact and Poetry Ireland.<\/p><p>Full details are available at <i>www.cultureireland.gov.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the agencies under its remit and other sectorial stakeholders to ensure that there is the greatest level of awareness of the supports that are available, and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to best support the sector at this challenging time.<\/p><p>During this emergency period the first phase of recovery has been the introduction of exceptional measures such as the pandemic payment and the wage subsidy schemes. My colleague Minister Doherty recently announced that over a million people across several sectors are now receiving some sort of state income support which is unprecedented in this nation&rsquo;s history. These are divided between the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUPs), those on the Live Register and workers who are benefiting from the Wage Subsidy Scheme.<\/p><p>I look forward to working with my colleagues across government on the type of measures that will be needed to allow the economy recover and to see sectors such as the arts and cultural sector play a full role in the recovery phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gorse Burning","counter":3792,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05700"},{"type":"question","counter":3793,"qnumday":1338,"qnumall":"[5437\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020051300143#WROOO05800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will consider establishing a multi-agency taskforce to examine the cause of repeated occurrences of illegal gorse burning; and her plans to propose remedies to address the problem and to report back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1626","askee":"1472"},{"type":"speech","counter":3794,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding the recent fires and illegal burning generally.<\/p><p>There are already a number of the Multi-Agency Gorse Fire Groups in existence that explore issues surrounding such fires, in different locations around the country.
