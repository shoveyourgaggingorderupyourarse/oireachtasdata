He is joined by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Catherine Connolly.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of 26 September and 3 October agreed?  Agreed.  One matter arises from those minutes and I will deal with it as part of the work programme.<\/p> <p>  I shall now deal with correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  I will start with category A.  No. 2429 and No. 2439 from the National Transport Authority are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that Agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is from Accounting Officers or Ministers that follow up to PAC meetings and other items.  No. 2348 from Mr. Martin Whelan, head of public affairs and communications, National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, providing information requested by the committee as follows: the NTMA's voluntary redundancy and retention schemes; the timetable agreed with the Central Bank and European Central Bank on the exchange of promissory notes for debt on the open market; details regarding gross national debt; how Apple records the escrow fund in its annual accounts, which we had dealt with just before the summer; clarification on the NTMA's policy with regard to investment in nuclear weapons; and the jobs supported by the NTMA and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, including the number of jobs supported, a breakdown by category, region and company size and whether this support takes the form of a grant to individual organisations.  This is the essence of why we held over the previous correspondence from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, No. 2342.  We had asked for that figure from SBCI, which came back with a breakdown of the employment in supports to small and medium sized enterprises supported by SBCI showing 148,735 people.  We knew this figure was not the jobs directly created and that it related to the total employment in the companies.  This correspondence from the NTMA deals with that and gives the total job numbers at 32,069, broken down by region.  It is a much more realistic figure.  It is an ongoing issue with regard to State bodies with double, treble, quadruple and multiple counting of the same jobs and the same employments in the figures of those they say they actually support.  We now have a more accurate figure.  We had been holding this correspondence over until the committee saw this clarification.  Part of this correspondence includes notes on rent paid by the NTMA and any sister companies and the cost to the NTMA for its new premises.  We will note and publish this correspondence.  People are free to comment on that.  It will be on the public record for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1570694400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I wish to raise one issue on the national debt with regard to the chart on page 3 of the correspondence.

The other side of it is that the banks probably have cash reserves , possibly of &euro;20 billion or &euro;30 billion, on which they are gaining very little interest on.

It was a wider discussion on all of the Department's projects.  Deputy Catherine Murphy talks about process and fixed-price contracts.  I agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General that there is an element of risk with any project and there is always the potential for a cost overrun.  However, what we need to be looking at is whether we are good in the public sector at capturing the risks.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does this to some extent when he does special reports and looks at the start of the project to its conclusion.  There are matters we may not be able to foresee but what we have seen in some of these projects are things that could have been spotted.  We then see bespoke arrangements being put in place like the children's hospital, where there was a different type of system in the context of how it was rolled out.  At the design stage, we should be capturing all of the risks.  That is what this committee needs to be examining, the process from start to finish and the different types of processes, tendering projects and so on.  There seems to be a drift in recent times towards  more bespoke arrangements that have not worked.  I do not know where we go with it.

He specifically says that despite some attempts of some sectors of the media to suggest otherwise, it is clear that the public are hugely supportive of this particular issue.

There is a great deal of learning to be done by the public service on the role of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The response we got back is another example of that.  I agree, therefore, that we should write back to Mr. Watt to emphasise again the questions we put and the answers we want.  We are not seeking an appraisal from him on how wonderful the public services card is for users.  We were not asking that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#C02200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570694400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The response does not answer the primary question the Chairman put.  In fact, we are trying to piece that information together.  Mr. Watt did not address, for example, the lawful use of the card.  The report of the Data Protection Commissioner was very interesting in that it highlighted the fact that while the chip on the card has to be read, the technology to do so is not in place in some of the bodies that would be using the card to update people's information.  The report identified many issues and was comprehensive.  I wonder whether people were asked about them in the satisfaction survey.  They presumed the card was an enabler whereas the Data Protection Commissioner drew attention to the fact that it was the opposite.  It was about delaying or denying services, with a number of examples provided in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We need a digital strategy.  Most members here agree.  However, it must be underpinned by law and cannot be something that happens by way of creep.  It is not acceptable that the Department cannot answer the questions we ask.  We heard last week that the National Transport Authority, NTA, harvests a great deal of information from the public services card, which makes it possible to identify, albeit not necessarily by that body, every trip taken.  The Chairman raised that matter himself.  That is mass surveillance.  There is a question of balance, rights and whether this will cost money on foot of some future dispute between the Data Protection Commissioner and the Department.  There was something obvious in that regard in yesterday's budget.  The Data Protection Commissioner told us last week the workload the commission would have and what its expectation was for next year's budget.  However, it did not get the money to do the work and will have to reassess its workload.

The Committee of Public Accounts is watching non-compliant procurement and will write to the board of the university, or as the case may be, to reinforce at board level that this practice cannot continue.

On 12 December, we will have Pobal.<\/p> <p>  As I said when discussing the minutes, we noted letters from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment the last day.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a chapter in his report relating to greenhouse gases and he highlighted the issue of carbon taxes.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I can think of no other issue that falls more within the committee's remit than carbon taxes.  There is much talk about ring-fencing the &euro;90 million in carbon taxes so that we know how it is spent.  That overlooks the fact that over &euro;400 million was raised in carbon tax last year.  I do not know how that money was spent.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said it is not transparent across any Departments how the carbon tax collected to date has been spent.  Page 141 of his report deals with carbon tax receipts from 2010 to 2018.  The chart shows that receipts averaged &euro;300 million per annum.  Well over &euro;3 billion has been collected in carbon tax since 2010.  The Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Public Expenditure and Reform need to let us know where that money was spent.  It would be shameful to think that we have collected this carbon tax and it has not been spent on reducing CO2 emissions.<\/p> <p>  It appears there is no system in Government showing where this money has been spent, which is not good enough.  The Committee of Public Accounts will not accept taxes being collected for a particular purpose when nobody can say if it has been used for that purpose.  It goes into the general tax take; I do not mind that.  If &euro;450 million is collected, we want to know where it is going and especially where it went this year and last year.<\/p> <p>  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, published a report earlier this summer entitled, Fossil Fuels and Similar Subsidies 2012-2016.  We might write to the CSO asking if it has any further information that could assist us on this.  That report stated that &euro;4.1 billion of taxpayers' money had been spent on \"potentially environmentally damaging subsidies\" and revenue foregone each year.  Some of the subsidies to the various organisations are necessary because without them it would cause severe financial difficulty.  It might be to the hauliers and some of it might relate to the fuel allowance.  We are not discussing the policy but the point is that rather than collecting carbon tax and giving money to support people to continue burning turf, coal and other fossil fuel, we should be more proactive and use the money to reduce people's dependence on turf and coal, thereby reducing CO2 emissions.<\/p> <p>  The CSO report is very interesting.<\/p><p>I find it strange that we seem to be collecting up to &euro;400 million a year in carbon tax, yet taxpayers are spending &euro;4.1 billion on what the CSO calls \"environmentally damaging subsidies and taxes foregone\".  That seems a total contradiction.  A large amount of money was collected in recent years but nobody can tell us how it was spent.  It is the job of this committee to find out where that money went.  We will be calling in the Department urgently, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have a busy schedule, so we may need to have a special meeting on a Tuesday.  People want to know where the money collected in carbon taxes is going.  That is my observation.  I will take a comment, but I will be pushing for a special meeting on this issue.  I do not want to knock something else off of the schedule, but this is a major issue.  Lest people ask why this committee is discussing carbon tax, we are doing this because many billions of euro have been collected under that heading in recent years.  We do not know, however, where that money goes and we are going to find out.  I call Deputy MacSharry first, and then Deputy Cullinane.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#E00900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570694400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I agree with the Chair.

We need to look at how much money came in and how it was spent.  Equally, because of its nature, this was meant to be a tax that would encourage people to change their behaviour by reducing carbon emissions etc.  It would also be good to get a sense, from a value-for-money perspective, of whether the tax has done that.  The logic of the tax was to reduce people's dependency on carbon.  It does not seem to have done that and therefore it would be good to see if we can get as much information as possible from those Departments.<\/p> <p>  If we take the examples of the plastic bag levy and the sugar tax, I imagine they were much more successful because people had obvious alternatives.  It was possible to go from a Coke to a Coke Zero very easily and there are alternatives to plastic bags.  Those are levies which I support and which work.  Things are less clear if we focus in on the carbon tax.  It is less if it is serving the purpose for which it was first established.  There is also the issue concerning where the money goes once it is raised and whether it is being used to reduce people's dependency on carbon.  Regarding that value for money aspect and whether it changes people's behaviour, and therefore reduces emissions, can we get as much information as possible from the Departments?  I refer, in particular, to figures for emissions each year since the carbon tax came in.  I would like to know if emissions have gone up or down.  It will be said that this is counter-factual in that even though emissions went up, that was because the economy grew.  It is difficult to get information in this area, however.  Nobody from the Department, that I have seen, is able to give any concrete proof that the carbon tax has changed the behaviour of people and is serving the purpose for which it was introduced.  That would be an interesting element to explore.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#F00900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1570694400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Government has argued that the ring-fencing of this fund is to bring about behavioural change.  It could not be argued that what was collected so far served that purpose because it was merely a revenue-raising exercise.  The tax was introduced in 2010 and much money has been raised since that could have gone towards retrofitting, etc.  When we examine this issue, it is important that we get up-to-date information regarding the fines Ireland is likely to face.  The totality of the cost of moving people from their established patterns and changing their behaviour has to be factored in.  It may be a case that spending to change behaviour may, ultimately, allow us to save money.  The CSO does extraordinary work in collecting data.  There is often a call for this type of information to allow planning for the future, but often we end up not using it when it is provided.

Mention was made of Ireland possibly facing fines.  We have not faced fines to date and there is no prospect of facing fines at the moment.  That is solely because we spend taxpayers' money in advance buying the unused carbon credits of other countries through the emissions trading scheme.  We have spent money in order to avoid having to pay the fines.  It is the same thing, only we have bought our way out of the fines for some years now.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report has a chapter this year on greenhouse gas and related financial transactions and that will be the basis of our discussion.  Towards the end of that chapter, he mainly deals with emissions trading.  He does, however, go into the carbon taxes but we are going to home in on that element because the emissions trading purchases are a bit historic at this stage.  We discussed this issue previously.<\/p> <p>  We will focus on the carbon tax in more detail in the next meeting.  We are going to ask for information from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the CSO.  Specifically, we will ask the Revenue what way it has of identifying the carbon tax.  It does not decide spending, but we will want a clear statement as to how the tax is collected and the basis on which it is levied.  We will want that information in practical, people-friendly terms, rather than dealing with information in technical detail, such as the tax being &euro;15 a tonne and converting it to litres for home heating oil, or however else it is used.  We will ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform whether it has any information on how the carbon tax revenues are spent.  The funds accrued would have been spent by different Departments on things such as retrofitting in houses, etc.  Some of the spending, therefore, might not have been under the rubric of the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment.  We will put that Department on notice that we will be arranging an early special Tuesday meeting on the use of carbon taxes collected to date.  We will try to finalise a date for that next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

It is sitting in an account and there are hard-pressed consumers.  The levy is at 2 cent, which is clearly more than and exceeds the amount for estimated expenses.  To me that is a breach of the legislation.  They are gathering up all this money.  I wonder how the directors feel about it because there is an unusual thing in the accounts for 2018.  I am not an accountant so maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General will state his view on this.  They have it as reserves.  In their accounts, it says that to date this surplus has been retained arising from the development of plans by Government for the repurposing the levy as a source of funding for a new climate action fund.  It ties in a little bit with the other point that was made about carbon tax.  We have gathered up this money and we have breached legislation in continuing to gather it at the rate we are gathering it.

The authority is the main conduit for the provision of State funding to operators of public transport.  The authority&rsquo;s income in 2018 amounted to &euro;504.9 million.  Expenditure amounted to &euro;504.3 million, resulting in a surplus for the year of just under &euro;600,000.  Oireachtas grants to the authority in 2018 totalled &euro;544 million.  The bulk of this was passed on to transport operators in the form of public service obligation, PSO, funding to subsidise the cost of public transport, or was provided as capital grants for the development or acquisition of public transport assets.<\/p> <p>  Since 2017, the authority has been building up its own fleet of buses, which it assigns to public transport operators.  The buses are recognised as fixed assets on the authority&rsquo;s statement of financial position.  In 2018, the authority added new buses to the fleet at a cost of &euro;84 million, and received transfers from Dublin Bus of buses of varying ages, with a combined depreciated value of &euro;12.4 million.  The carrying value of the whole fleet at the end of 2018 was just under &euro;116 million.  The authority developed the integrated ticketing system, better known as the Leap card system, in co-operation with the main public transport operators.  The authority maintains and operates the system, collecting fares and distributing them to the operators in line with agreed apportionment rules.  It recovers its own costs of operation of the system from the transport operators.  Leap card fare revenues collected in 2018 amounted to &euro;320 million, which was up almost 16% from 2017.  The revenues do not appear as income of the authority.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General certified the 2018 financial statements on 30 June 2019 and issued a clear audit opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness"},{"type":"speech","time":1570694400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harkness.

As requested by the committee&rsquo;s secretariat, we have furnished some information in advance.  To assist in answering the members' questions I am accompanied by three directors from the National Transport Authority: Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO, Tim Gaston, director of public transport services, and Philip L&rsquo;Estrange, director of finance and corporate services.<\/p> <p>  Our remit is primarily concerned with the planning, development and funding of sustainable transport modes, that is to say, public transport, cycling and walking.  At a national level, the authority has responsibility for securing the provision of bus and rail services.  This includes the provision of subsidised services through directly awarded contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail.  The authority also tendered for the provision of bus services throughout the country, and our contracted operators include Go-Ahead Ireland Limited, JJ Kavanagh, Bernard Kavanagh, M&amp;A Coaches and Wharton&rsquo;s Travel.  The authority is also responsible for light rail services, which we procure jointly with Transport Infrastructure Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The authority also regulates and licenses public bus passenger services that operate without subsidy from the State.  We also manage the rural transport programme on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Associated with the bus, rail and light rail services, a key role for the authority has been the integration of payment systems and information for public transport users.  The authority has overseen the successful introduction of initiatives such as the Leap card, a real-time passenger information system for buses, and an intermodal journey planner that covers all services of private and public operators in the State.<\/p> <p>  The authority is also responsible at a national level for the licensing and the regulation of small public service vehicles, comprising taxis, hackneys and limousines, and the regulation of vehicle clamping.  Within the greater Dublin area the authority has a greater depth of functions.  The authority&rsquo;s role covers not only public transport capital investment and provision of services but also securing greater integration between land use and transport planning.  The authority&rsquo;s statutory Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 sets out the key transport projects that are required to be delivered to provide for the growth in travel demand by sustainable modes.<\/p> <p>  The authority manages the capital investment programme for public transport, cycling and walking in the greater Dublin area and funds the transport operators and local authorities for approved projects.  The authority also manages a similar capital investment programme for the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and we manage the national accessibility programme.  The strong growth in demand for public transport we have experienced in recent years continued during 2018, at 6.5% across all PSO services.<\/p><p>The number of passengers using bus and rail services was at an all-time high and those services received a 93% satisfaction rating among users.<\/p><p> In Dublin, surveys showed that more than half of all commuters travelling into the city centre at the peak morning travel time used public transport.  This is positive from the perspective of increasing transport efficiency and sustainability, but because of the low level of investment in public transport infrastructure in the aftermath of the economic downturn, services can be very crowded at peak travel times.  This trend seems set to continue and underscores the need to further expand and develop public transport infrastructure, particularly in our major urban areas.  The Government has published a long-term investment strategy, the National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027, which includes significant developments such as the BusConnects programme, the MetroLink and a DART expansion programme, as well as other important public transport projects that will assist in meeting the demand for sustainable transport, as well as our obligations to reduce carbon emissions.  This allowed the authority to commence public consultations on the emerging proposals in respect of MetroLink and BusConnects.  The feedback from the public from these consultations is an essential and helpful input into the design of these schemes, which are expected to be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for statutory approvals in 2020.<\/p><p> The authority formally entered into a contract with Go-Ahead Ireland for the operation of a number of local and orbital bus routes in Dublin last year and, in September of that year, the new operator commenced the phased implementation of services in Dublin.  While some teething issues were experienced initially, they were quickly overcome and Go-Ahead Ireland is now successfully operating a significant proportion of Dublin&rsquo;s bus services.  The introduction of competition into the PSO bus market will enable the authority to evaluate in more depth the value for money of the directly awarded contracts.  As a result of the transfer of routes to Go-Ahead Ireland, we were able to re-deploy the Dublin Bus resources in areas to provide additional capacity at peak times across the Dublin Bus network.  In December Bus &Eacute;ireann, which successfully tendered for the operation of bus services in Waterford city, commenced the roll-out of a much enhanced timetable of services using a new fleet of buses.<\/p><p> In the short term, the commuter rail system will experience capacity issues at peak travel times due to the improvement in the economy.  There is an urgent need for additional rail fleet to meet the increase in passenger numbers.  While preparations for the procurement of new electric and battery electric rail fleet are under way, the process of having rail fleet built is a lengthy one.  Accordingly, the authority, together with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, has prepared a business case for the purchase of an additional 41 intercity rail cars which, if given Government approval, could be put into service in about 24 months.<\/p><p> The cancellation of ferry services operated by Irish Ferries due to delays in the delivery of a new car ferry resulted in the first significant case for the authority in its capacity as the national enforcement body for EU regulations on passenger rights in the maritime and land transport areas.  There was intensive engagement between the authority and the operator, and the authority&rsquo;s decision in the matter was finally announced early in 2019, a decision which is now the subject of High Court proceedings.<\/p><p> The success of the Transport for Ireland, TFI, Leap card scheme continued unabated during 2018.  In May, the 3 millionth TFI Leap card was sold, which has exceeded our expectations.  Once again we offered TFI child Leap card holders the opportunity to travel free on bus and rail services for a period over the summer.  Advances in technology are adding new options for fare payments.  Accordingly, the authority is actively engaged on the next evolution of the TFI Leap card scheme.<\/p><p> Local Link services in rural areas continue to develop and grow.  At the request of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the authority developed a pilot scheme for the operation of Local Link evening and night-time services to provide an alternative to car travel for social activities.  The pilot ran until the end of the year when it was decided to extend the pilot for a further period.<\/p><p> The transition to a wheelchair-accessible taxi fleet continued.  This was again assisted by the provision of grant funding to assist operators to purchase suitable vehicles.  During the year, 679 wheelchair accessible licences were added to the fleet, bringing the overall number to 2,220.  We also launched a major publicity programme to encourage more people to join the taxi sector.<\/p><p> Since its establishment, the authority has been significantly under-resourced.  Our staffing complement, in particular, has been well below what we require to effectively undertake our statutory and non-statutory functions.  A great deal of work was undertaken during the year on the development of a strategic resourcing plan to identify the needs in that regard and in consultations with our parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am pleased that this culminated in approval for the filling of a significant number of key posts in 2019, which will assist greatly in building our capacity to deliver our mandate.  In terms of our funding and expenditure, the authority has been strongly focused from the outset on ensuring that we have robust financial and audit controls, bearing in mind the scale and range of the authority&rsquo;s financial activities.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening remarks and I welcome any questions that members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570694400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We will carry out more research to determine, if we can, how much of that is attributable to Kids Go Free.  There is no doubt that there was more adult travel in that period and subsequently.

First, I commend the NTA on the work it has done.  I read its 2018 report, which was comprehensive.  There have been many advances in public transport for which we can be thankful.  There has been an increase in the use of public transport as well, which is good.  I wish to examine, from a value for money perspective, how the NTA sees public transport evolving over the next ten to 20 years.  Dublin, for example, is one issue.  Obviously, projects such as metro north and BusConnects are two big developments in Dublin city.  However, public transport outside Dublin is equally important.  The national planning framework in the national development plan envisages regional cities.  Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are four regional cities.  The plan envisages increasing the population in those cities, building capacity in them and for them to act as a counterweight to Dublin in terms of more balanced development and to ensure we do not overheat the capital city.  We have to plan for that and for those population increases.  Part of that must be public transport.<\/p> <p>  When looking at Galway, Limerick, Cork or Waterford, what criteria are used to assess what public transport systems should be in place?  What modes of public transport must be put in place?  Critical mass is obviously one element of it.  The current population of my city of Waterford is 55,000.  If that increases to 80,000, what changes?  The same applies to Cork and Limerick.  Is the NTA involved in that exercise of looking ten to 20 years into the future in the context of the national development plan?  Second, has the NTA's analysis shifted or has there been a step change given that climate change, climate action, reducing emissions and ending, or at least reducing, car dependency are critical?  How has that impacted on the policy development in these areas?  Perhaps we can park the issue of Dublin for the moment, and I can return to it.  In the cities I mentioned and in rural areas outside Dublin, what criteria would the NTA use to determine what type of public transport should be in place in a ten to 20-year timeframe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#R01400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570694400,"counter":424,"content":"<p>It is usually the demand for transport, and that is modelled.

It is great to have the witnesses here.  The NTA's remit includes developing an integrated transport system in the greater Dublin area.  On Tuesday last, a report was published jointly by Kildare and Meath county councils on the experiences of commuters.  This is an extensive piece of work on the experiences of commuters.  The findings of the report are of major significance to the Government and statutory transport bodies such as the NTA because Kildare and Meath are the two counties within the greater Dublin area that have experienced the largest increases in population in the past two decades.  Having served on a local authority for 17 years, I know that the explosion in population in certain areas is a direct consequence of national and regional policies on where population bases should be located.  If a geographical area has experienced a population explosion, one would expect the Government and statutory body agencies to pursue policies to provide services in a range of areas, from education to healthcare to transport, especially given that these urbanised areas are a consequence of policy.<\/p> <p>  Some of the statistics from the report published on Tuesday made for interesting reading.  More than 40% of commuters would take a pay cut to have a job closer to home, such is the hellish experience of their commute.  The average journey time for people in these commuter counties is 70 minutes.  The daily commute of 43% of respondents takes more than 90 minutes and for 12% of respondents it takes in excess of two hours to get into the city.  A total of 53% of male commuters leave their homes before 7 a.m.  This is an interesting statistic because the peak hour used in the NTA's Navan corridor study, which was part of its transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, was 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., whereas the report by the two local authorities found that 53% of male commuters and 45% of female commuters leave for work before 7 a.m., with 16% leaving before 6 a.m.  The peak commuter hour in County Meath where I Iive, County Kildare where Deputy Murphy lives and County Louth where Deputy Munster lives is 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.  People leave for work at that time because there are no viable alternatives.  Anyone from my home town who is on the road later than 7 a.m. will have a two-hour commute.  This has consequences for family life, social structures and mental health.  Every day, 33,000 of my constituents commute to Dublin for work, the vast majority of them by private car.  According to the study published on Tuesday, of the commuters who are lucky enough to be able to avail of public transport, 56% of those in County Kildare and 64% of those in County Meath were unhappy with the cost of the commute.  Have the witnesses seen the results of the analysis published by the two local authorities on Tuesday?  What are their thoughts on some of the statistics I cited on the duration and costs of commuting and the experiences of commuters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101000002#V00400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570694400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I have not seen the report.

This is not sustainable from our point of view.

We have been examining it for two decades, when I was a member of the transportation strategic policy committee, SPC, on Meath County Council.  I will contact the council's chief executive about having a meeting with the NTA.  The premise for such a meeting would be to examine how, given the huge number of people returning to work and commuting into the city centre and the population explosion in towns such as Dunshaughlin and Navan, the figures in the previous report need to be reviewed sooner than 2021, especially as the draft development plan is about to be published.<\/p><p>The regional, spatial and economic strategy for 2019-31 is a very important document, particularly for public transport.  Last August, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, issued a draft ministerial direction to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly that it delete the line, &quot;Implement the extension of the Dunboyne\/M3 Parkway line to Navan line during the Mid Term Review of the GDA transport strategy&quot; and insert the words &quot;A reappraisal of the extension of the Dunboyne\/M3 Parkway line to Navan&quot;.  The Minister did this following advice from the NTA in correspondence dated 24 July, advising that the inclusion of the line should be rejected and not included in the strategy.  This was big news in Meath and at the time there was great anger in local media in the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>and LMFM, local radio.  I seek appreciation of that today because when a public transport solution for a large urban area such as Navan is rejected while every other comparable town in the GDA and smaller ones have rail connectivity to the city centre, it causes great anger.  Not only is the project being mothballed and rejected but we are down to using the term &quot;reappraisal&quot; in connection with the extension of the line to Navan.  I would like the NTA's comment on that and advice on the assessment.

The M3, which was the largest road construction project of the past decade, is effectively redundant as a transport solution because it is so congested.  I have raised this with the Taoiseach because he lives in Blanchardstown in the neighbouring constituency.

My opening question was to ask what each organisation does.  The public does not get it.  There is total misunderstanding of the organisations' separate roles.  They have to do something to separate that in the public mind because they have not even separated it in the minds of many Oireachtas Members.  I am looking at the strategies such as Rural Link.

I see the National Transport Authority somewhere, then the buses with a Transport for Ireland logo, then I hear about Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I think the witnesses get my point.  Somebody has caused confusion in the public mind by having three different names connected to public transport and nobody knows which is which.

The ESRI welcomes the creation of the Land Development Agency and will be happy to provide any information or advice which helps the agency in its mission.  I will start by providing some background to the work the ESRI has been conducting in the housing area.  To date, most of this work has focused on the demand-side of the housing market by examining the sustainability or otherwise of house price developments at both a national and regional level.  Work has recently also focused on the affordability of housing costs in the Irish market generally.  In particular, housing costs as a percentage of income has been examined across the distribution of Irish households for different tenure types and over time.  Further work on affordability for first-time buyers is under way at present.<\/p> <p>  What can we conclude on the basis of this work as far as the Land Development Agency is concerned?  Overall, since the mid-1990s Irish house price movements have been among the most volatile across OECD countries.  The period can be divided into three sub-samples.  Between 1995 and 2007, house prices grew in nominal terms by 340%.  From 2007 to 2013 they fell by 55% before recovering by 83% between 2013 and today.  Developments on the supply side of the market have been equally volatile.  In 1995, we estimate that approximately 20,000 new housing units were constructed in the Irish market.  This figure escalated to over 62,000 units in 2006 before declining to just over 4,500 units in 2013.  The figure for 2019 is likely to be approximately 21,000 units.  Such variations both in price and supply levels have had substantial repercussions for the economy, the financial sector and for society as a whole.  In short, these significant oscillations in key housing variables are far from optimal and policy should clearly aim, as with most economic variables, to achieve stable house price inflation and rates of housing supply.  Such stability enables households on the demand-side and firms on the supply-side of the market to plan more effectively over the medium-term.  It also ensures that housing-related developments will not have a disproportionately large and potentially destabilising impact on the wider economy.<\/p> <p>  Our analysis of recent developments in house prices suggests broadly that price level movements whether nationally or regionally are currently determined by fundamental factors in the economy.  By this, we mean that current house price levels can be explained in terms of factors such as disposable income levels in the economy, demographics, the number of jobs being created and the cost of finance in the market.  However, this analysis takes certain supply-side issues in the housing market as given or fixed.  For example, when we say that we feel that house price levels are explained or determined by fundamental factors in the economy, that is for a given set of supply-side issues such as land costs.  Clearly, any change in land costs can influence the long-run equilibrium house price in the market.  At present, it is clear that the level of housing supply is persistently below the demand for housing, or structural demand, in the Irish economy.  While estimates of this demand vary, the institute's view is that between 30,000 to 35,000 units are required per annum over the medium term to meet this demand.  Clearly, the level of actual supply is significantly below this and has been for quite some time.<\/p><p>However, our belief in the institute is that between 30,000 and 35,000 units are required per annum over the medium term to meet this demand.  Clearly, the level of actual supply is significantly below that and has been for quite some time.  As long as this imbalance between supply and demand exists, the cost of housing in the Irish economy looks set to continue to increase.  While house price inflation has eased in the Irish market over the past 12 months, rents continue to increase at a significant rate.<\/p><p> In a recent comparison of cross-country house price levels, Bricongne, Turrini and Pontuch confirm that Irish house price levels, when allowing for scale, are among the highest of the 39 countries considered.  Therefore, it is clear that if a significant increase in housing supply is required in the Irish market at this time, it can only really be achieved through a reduction in the cost of supplying a property to the market.  While official, actual data on development land costs are not available, certain information would suggest that, in an Irish context, land costs are a substantial portion of the overall cost of building a property.  Recently in the quarterly economic commentary, QEC, the ESRI has called for a more aggressive stance to be taken by policy makers on this issue.  I will briefly explain the rationale for this; if the cost of development land is significantly greater than the agricultural value of land, it suggests that the difference may be due to a speculative component.  The speculative component mainly arises because owners of the land have not, until recently, faced any cost in not developing this land for property development.  Developers can merely sit back and watch the value of the land increase significantly year on year as the demand for this land increases.  Therefore, by accurately pricing a site tax, this speculative component can be tackled as developers will now face a cost if they do not develop their land.  This will ultimately lead to a reduction in the price of land, thereby reducing the cost of supplying a house.  All things being equal, this would result in an increase in supply at a given price.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, this diagnosis of issues in the Irish housing market is not new; the Kenny report in 1973 identified building land as a major issue with the report recommending that such land should be acquired by local authorities for 25% more than its agricultural value.  More generally, from an international perspective, it is well established that markets that have greater control over the provision of land tend to experience much more significant house price inflation than markets such as Germany and Switzerland, where policy ensures that adequate housing is supplied.  As Cheshire pointed out in 2014, the greater restriction on the provision of land for housing in the United Kingdom post the Second World War has turned housing and housing land increasingly into investment assets.<\/p><p> Policies to increase housing supply can often operate at a considerable lag between the announcement of the policy and its actual impact.  By addressing the provision of land, the Land Development Agency can directly help to deal with the supply issue.  Other policies such as the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, can also be important in escalating the provision of housing.  From an affordability perspective, the specific price for which new units come onto the market is critical and ultimately, the units must be affordable to the typical buyer.  Therefore, we in the institute would welcome any policy or development such as the establishment of the Land Development Agency, which increases the provision of land for housing purposes.  I thank members for their attention.  We look forward to taking questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McQuinn and call on Dr. Larry O'Connell to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#H00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>We also thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this invitation to speak on NESC's work on urban development land, housing and infrastructure.  Mr. Noel Cahill and I are members of the secretariat in NESC and are attending in that capacity.  NESC is a Government body which advises the Taoiseach on strategic policy issues.  The members are appointed by the Taoiseach and represent business, employers, trade unions, agricultural and farming organisations, community and voluntary organisations, and environmental organisations; as well as heads of various Departments and independent experts.  Its composition means it plays an important and unique role in bringing different perspectives from civil society together with Government.<\/p> <p>  The NESC report, Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure published in 2018, highlighted that the availability of land for housing in appropriate locations, which is consistent with the provision of affordable housing, remains an unresolved policy issue in Ireland.  The supply conditions of land help to create a speculative land and housing market.  The supply of land is uncertain, patchy and costly.  This tends to make the housing system risky, unstable and unaffordable.<\/p> <p>  Based on an examination of countries with successful experience of housing, NESC found effective solutions involve a combination of three things.  The first is active land management and urban development by highly skilled and respected public authorities.  The second is housing policies focused on achieving permanent affordability.  The third is a range of mechanisms to use the value added to land by investment to help fund necessary infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  For those reasons NESC recommended the creation of a public body with a strong developmental mandate, political authorisation and executive capacity to drive sustainable urban development.  As such, the council views the establishment of the Land Development Agency as potentially a very significant and important way of addressing critical issues regarding land supply and housing and the related challenge of supporting increased investment in infrastructure.  It is a means of putting public land in the hands of actors who will develop it in a timely and appropriate manner, rather than seeking to maximise State revenue by selling it outright, without regard to when and how the land will be developed.<\/p> <p>  It also an important step in the right direction in terms of creating the conditions and institutions for more active land management and new kinds of relationships between public authorities and private holders of development land.  In the remaining part of the opening statement, my colleague, Mr. Noel Cahill, will highlight a number of lessons which we believe are relevant to the committee's deliberations in relation to the legislation governing the LDA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>The first lesson is that affordability should be an explicit objective for a body such as the Land Development Agency.  The international cases show that supply of housing is not in itself a reliable or sustainable means of making housing affordable.  Like other countries, Ireland must engineer affordability into the supply of housing.  It must be a stated objective for the public institution.<\/p> <p>  Second, we think that cost rental must be a critical strategic priority for the Land Development Agency.  It is a key tool which can bring affordability into our housing system.  Public land should be used to create permanent housing affordability.  The cost-rental model is characterised by modest supply-side support.  It uses land and finance at favourable rates, to underpin affordability.  Cost rental makes the affordability permanent by ensuring that rents cover costs and that the equity that accrues as loans are repaid creates a revolving fund, which is used to underpin further affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  The third lesson is that a body like the Land Development Agency needs effective compulsory purchase powers.  A key insight from international experience is that working relationships that exist with private developers require that public bodies have available to them effective compulsory purchase powers.  These are rarely used.  However, the dynamic of the land market changes where there is a credible possibility of public purchase of urban development land at less than its full development value.  Effective compulsory order, CPO, powers ensure that all actors take planning seriously.<\/p> <p>  The fourth lesson is that an additional way of achieving permanent affordability is that the Land Development Agency, rather than selling land outright, would lease it to others who could develop and own buildings on it.  In areas where land costs are high, this approach means that the initial purchase price can be much lower than in a conventional purchase.  Leasing can also be used to ensure that where land is provided for affordable rental accommodation that it is kept permanently affordable.  The fifth lesson is that to enhance affordability on private land, NESC has also recommended that consideration be given to a requirement in Ireland for affordable housing on private land beyond the current Part V requirement for 10% social housing.<\/p> <p>  The sixth lesson is that one of the objectives of the LDA is to support the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.  The search to buy affordable property often leads to dispersed development, notwithstanding the Project Ireland policy goal of compact development.  An alternative to dispersal was set out in a recent NESC report on transport-orientated development, TOD, which seeks to maximise the provision of housing, employment, public services and leisure space in close proximity to frequent, high-quality transport services.  The LDA could be a significant contributor to the achievement of this form of development.<\/p><p>We recognise there is a trade-off between the goals of making housing affordable and achieving a commercial return on land assets.  However, a balance can be achieved between these objectives.  For example, if land is leased on a long-term basis then the initial affordability is improved while value can be recovered over time.  In some examples of high quality development we have looked at, such as in Freiburg in Germany, money is borrowed to invest in infrastructure and land development and then repaid through the sale of developed plots, in some cases to self-building co-operatives.  This means the revenue from selling land is helping to expand the supply of development land.  The land agency in Vienna is another example of how these objectives have been balanced.  This agency was established in 1984 to provide land for subsidised housing.  The land owned by the city council was transferred to the agency.  Since then, it has operated on a self-funding basis in buying, developing and reselling land.  It sells land to affordable housing providers at a price that it is sufficient to cover the costs of the agency in supplying the land but is low enough to underpin housing that is affordable.  Typically in this case it is cost rental housing.<\/p><p> We view the Land Development Agency as a potentially positive institutional development.  It should prioritise the use of land for housing that is permanently affordable, including cost rental accommodation for middle-income households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cahill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I acknowledge the significant body of research NESC and the ESRI have been doing on land and housing.  The committee has been paying close attention to it.  As a small aside, as new research papers are produced it is always welcome if they are sent directly to the committee secretariat to circulate to us in case we miss some of the publication dates.<\/p> <p>  I have a list of questions for both organisations and I will go through them quickly.  The heads of the land development agency Bill do not include compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers.  Particularly with respect to NESC's view in its 2018 report that enhanced CPO powers are very important, I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the types of CPO powers they believe an effective land management agency would need and how much would it be hampered if it did not have CPO powers.<\/p> <p>  I also want to raise the issue of the Kenny report because it is something that is spoken about as often as it is ignored.  Much of the time when people speak about it they do not seem to have a full appreciation of what it proposed.  There is a very good summary of it in NESC's 2018 report.  The Kenny report recommended that subject to High Court approval a compulsory purchase order price would be set at the agricultural value of the land plus 25%.  The working assumption at that point was that the people who owned the land would have paid agricultural prices for it and, therefore, would get compensated for the money they paid plus extra.  The difficulty with applying a similar scheme today is that it is highly unlikely that the people from whom the land would be purchased bought at agricultural prices.  Given the constitutional issues not so much about property rights but about fair compensation, which is the real issue, how do the witnesses see a modern-day application of a similar scheme that would get us around the compensation issue?  Otherwise we would end up having to buy sites at the value paid for them, which could be very excessive.<\/p> <p>  I am also interested in the views of NESC on brownfield sites.  We used to talk about agricultural sites but much of what the Land Development Agency will be doing will be looking at brownfield or industrial estates.<\/p> <p>  A big concern for many of us in terms of how the Land Development Agency has been set up is affordability and the huge impact of land prices on affordable rents and purchases.  In Poppintree with &Oacute; Cualann, Dublin City Council extracted the land value completely out of the equation.  By doing this, we can deliver eminently affordable houses.  However, in O'Devaney Gardens it appears private developers are being allowed to extract the market value of the land despite the fact they are not paying for it.  How do we ensure that when the private sector is involved there is not land value extraction that pushes up the price of those properties?<\/p> <p>  Transparency was a big issue of concern for the committee when the Department appeared before us last week, with regard to the Land Development Agency not being subject to freedom of information for most of its dealings.  NESC spoke about a highly skilled and respected public agency.  The worry many of us have, and this is absolutely no disrespect to any of the people employed at present by the Land Development Agency, is that if it does not have transparency and accountability how can we guarantee it will have that public respect?  Are the witnesses concerned there are limitations on the extent of accountability and transparency?<\/p> <p>  My next question, on house price volatility, is more for the ESRI.  Many of the reports that have been produced have looked at demand and supply issues.  They have looked at the demand for housing versus the supply of housing and the demand and supply of land.  What many people have not focused on is the impact of credit liberalisation and the growing volumes of credit, particularly after the crash, and quantitative easing into land as a secure and stable investment.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on this?  Do we also need to be thinking about how we constrain not credit supply but speculative credit supply as part of our considerations on this?<\/p> <p>  The 2018 NESC report included a very interesting chapter on locational value mechanisms.  Will the witnesses summarise and give us an idiots guide to this?

The committee heard this from the Land Development Agency in its submission and discussion with it.  What is clear internationally is that having CPO powers to get people to take the engagement seriously is important.  It gets us to a discussion on the value of the land and trying to have the process.  The Deputy is raising the spectre of somebody walking onto a piece of land and stating he or she will demand to CPO it and somebody else saying it is his or her view that it should be done at current market value and there is an inflated view about that.  Something else that comes to bear in this discussion, as came up in the discussion the committee had with the Land Development Agency, is that affordability on the particular site will determine the actual value.  If it is to be 100% affordable then the land will not have a huge market value.  The particular figure worked out in the engagement becomes very important.  The key for us with regard to CPO powers is that they enable the discussion and negotiation to have a different character.<\/p> <p>  On the question about agricultural land versus brownfield land, we fully agree and our report is very conscious of it.

It is a very interesting point.  It points to the issue of dangers of too much credit to start with.  We have very much focused on the implications of credit availability on house prices and all the distress that was caused in the financial downturn.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of reasons for land being targeted as an investment.  If people believe that house prices will continue to rise sharply, land will be an attractive proposition.  There is evidence that over the past year that the macroprudential rules have managed to calm the pace of house price inflation, certainly in the Dublin area.  The basic principle underpinning the macroprudential rules is that it should anchor house price movements to basically fundamental developments, income levels, etc., in the economy and that we will not have house prices spiralling way beyond income levels as they did before because people are just given even more credit.  That is one aspect.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect is the importance of the site tax.  Land is an attractive proposition if there is no cost to the holders.  If they can simply sit on it year-on-year there is a major incentive to invest in it.  Obviously, a site tax has been introduced with a higher rate applying.  If that is effective, it can help to target land so that people will not perceive it as being an attractive investment opportunity as was previously the case.  With the phenomenon of low interest rates globally, people are looking for yield.  Certainly with the macroprudential limits, house price movements should be more anchored.  We should not see the crazy returns and people should not expect the crazy returns that existed previously.  If a site tax is to be effective, it should target the speculative return on land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on the affordability and the credit liberalisation issue.  As the committee will be aware, we have done considerable work on affordability in recent years.  While we have a housing supply bottleneck, that supply bottleneck will not be dealt with by lots more units; it will be dealt with by units coming in at the right price that are affordable where those bottlenecks are.  The research is very clear on that; it is in lower to middle-income households.  When we look back on whether this initiative has been successful, a critical indicator will be the extent to which it has delivered units in that particular area.  The extent to which it can be leveraged to ensure affordable prices on the rental side and the purchase side is a critical indicator.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. McQuinn has mentioned, house price volatility has been a characteristic of the international environment.  With the very low interest rates, global speculative investment has looked for yield, and land not just in Ireland but in the UK and more globally has been a very attractive investment asset for many investors.  As Dr. McQuinn said, people holding that investment is not necessarily the issue; it is that they can sit on it and they do not have to use it with yield accrued over time.  The implication from a societal perspective is that units are not developed on that land.<\/p> <p>  While the LDA will not be able to deal with this on its own, it needs to come as part of a package of measures, including a site tax and other instruments that can be used to ensure that.

We keep coming back to how we achieve affordability.  Land cost has been identified as a critical part of that.  While Project Ireland 2040 is concentrating on stronger urban growth with higher densities and brownfield sites, the LDA can form part of the solution.  When we talk about land, even when talking about the agency, we keep referring to the market value of land.  As was explained in last week's presentation, it is not necessarily market value but what the site can ultimately deliver.  Dr. O'Connell mentioned that a site has a different value if it has 100% affordability.  Why is all State land not considered 100% affordable?  When we are dealing with State land and local authority land, why is it not just the cost of the land and not what it can deliver or its market value?<\/p><p>Even if some State land has no debt on it, why are we not taking advantage of that and leveraging that advantage to deliver affordability?  The more we rely on the private sector, the more bottlenecks we will generate.  Dr. O'Toole said the bottleneck is not at the high end but in the low- to middle-income bracket.  This is because there is more profit for builders to deliver at the high end of the market.  There is less profit in the middle sector.  That is why the State increasingly has a critical role in controlling the solutions to the housing crisis.<\/p><p> My other concern is that we have lost an incredible number of small building firms and we are relying increasingly on the large construction firms.  A factor we are beginning to note that has a critical impact on affordability is the profit margin the builders are now demanding in delivering projects.  There is an escalation of the margin.<\/p><p> CPO powers are critical.  There is a combination of factors, as all the delegates have said.  There is no doubt but that the threat of having good CPO powers is vital.  Whether they are ever used is not the point because, as long as they exist, they can be used as leverage in finding solutions.  I will be interested in seeing examples as the Bill goes through the House.<\/p><p> How is the vacant site levy working?  Is there any indication as to whether it is beginning to deliver solutions?  It would be great if the Land Development Agency were in a position to buy greenfield sites that are not zoned but, regrettably, we are in a cycle of development plans that have probably zoned private land holdings for up to nine years.  We are dealing with market values because the lands are privately owned.  Mr. Cahill gave a couple of examples.  I have seen a couple of examples across Europe.  I refer to going a bit further in our development plans and planning to a much greater degree.  The State would control the development by providing the infrastructure.<\/p><p> The other question is on our development plans.

Local governments have autonomy and own land, and they have pressures and responsibilities.  If central government were to attempt to do what is proposed, it would be very difficult.  I am not saying it would be the wrong thing to do necessarily, but it comes back to the process.  Let me give an example.  Mr. Cahill gave an example from Vienna.  Even there, where we see an effective housing market, the authorities are now finding it very difficult to get land to build more affordable housing.  They have now reset it and have subsidised housing zones.  In particular areas, where there is a development of more than 50 units, two thirds must be subsidised or affordable.  A law came in stipulating a reset in all those areas.<\/p> <p>  If we considered such a rule here, it would have considerable implications for local authorities in every single area where they own land.  It would have to be teased through.  If we did not do it, we would have to ensure negotiation.  This would involve creating an agency in the State with the power and staff to negotiate with individual local authorities.  It seems this is what the Land Development Agency was set up to do.  It is another question as to whether we are tying the agency's hands a little by deciding only 40% needs to be affordable.  Should we change that?  The policy at the moment is to have a 30:40 split.  While it is tempting to think there could be some sort of central law requiring all State land to be affordable, it would create enormous difficulties and resistance.  One would have to figure out how it would work.<\/p> <p>  The Land Development Agency is an institution that could deal with the profit margin of developers.  As it writes contracts and works with the private sector, it is clear that it will try to get the best value for money for the State on public land.<\/p> <p>  I do not know the answer to the question on how well the vacant site levy is working.  I believe, however, there is an important distinction between a vacant site levy and a site value tax.  From our perspective, we have been saying for quite some time that a site value tax might yield more benefits than a vacant site levy.  This is for many reasons.  There are practical difficulties in identifying vacant sites, and there is the matter of what people might do in terms of declassifying sites such that they will no longer be regarded as vacant if certain works take place, etc.<\/p> <p>  The vacant site levy is on the development land only so, in a sense, it raises the costs around the site.  A site value tax generates revenue from the land in an area.  In a sense, there would be a wider tax base to bring money in to fund development.  We can talk more about our views on this but it is important to make the distinction between a site value tax and a vacant site levy.  They are quite different and would have a different impact.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cahill might want to say more on planning and what is done in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>Development plans are high-level plans and cover all the areas on which development is envisaged over quite a long period.

An example of where that was done here involves Dublin Docklands Authority.  It had powers and finance and achieved a huge amount.  It may be an unfortunate example in some ways.

Going by some of the international literature, the more freely available the land is, the better for a housing market, the less the volatility and the fewer the swings in prices and housing supply.  Irrespective of whether the land is held by the State or privately held, the bottom line is that once land is more freely available, housing markets tend to operate more effectively and efficiently.  In Ireland, the Land Development Agency is very positive in that it can help to free up State-held land.  Equally, it is a question of considering measures such as the vacant site levy as a way of targeting land held on the private side.  The key issue is getting land, irrespective of whether it is held up by the State or privately.<\/p> <p>  On the profit margin issue, the point made was very valid.<\/p><p>As we mentioned in our opening statement, it has struck us that from a simple supply-and-demand perspective, people on the construction side may say the margins are not currently available to bring about greater levels of supply.  They might want 30,000 or 35,000 units, for example, but may get only 20,000.  Although they say profit margins are an issue, house price levels in Ireland are very high by international standards.  One cannot expect price levels to continue to rise, which brings us back to the kernel of the issue.  If there is not adequate supply, given the high price levels, it means the issue is on the supply side of the market rather than the demand or price side, which is a crucial point.<\/p><p> As for what the cost side is, we have identified land costs as one issue while others have mentioned productivity in the sector.  The construction sector is, relatively speaking, a sheltered part of the economy and is not as susceptible to competition in the way other sectors are.  There may be issues, therefore, with productivity in the sector.  People in the construction sector tell us it is inevitable that some of the changes on the banking and financing side would make life a little more difficult for the smaller-scale producers.  Given the changes in the finance and the higher levels of equity now required by developers, there tends to be a bias in favour of the larger-scale developers and operations.  That is a by-product of the fallout from the financial crisis.  There are certain factors we can consider but that is just the way the market is.  <\/p><p> I take Dr. O'Connell's point about the difference between a site value tax and the vacant site levy.  It is hard to work out how successful the levy has been, although there is certainly some evidence some sites have come on stream, as has some development.  Equally, however, it seems there are certain administrative issues with its implementation, some of which have been documented in the media.  One presumes that the sooner they are tightened up and the more efficient the levy is, the more it will help to bring private sector land into the market and affect the speculative component of land prices, which keeps them elevated and is one of the main reasons the cost of building a house is so high relative to other markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McQuinn and call Dr. O'Toole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#M00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>I do not have a great deal to add.

I would support a requirement that it would have, as an objective, the delivery of affordable units because it is critical to the issue in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On site taxes, in general, as Professor McQuinn highlighted, the international evidence indicates that where markets do not rely on bulk zoning activities and have a freer ability to manage land over the cycle or when it is needed, they do a better job of removing the volatility from the price movements, which a large body of international work has examined.  The characteristic, which is shared between the UK and Irish economies, has been pointed to as a bottleneck and difficulty from our point of view.<\/p> <p>  On the difference between the site value tax and the vacant site levy, as Professor McQuinn indicated, there appear to be administrative challenges with the vacant site levy, the registration process and other administrative aspects.  A site value tax is a more direct instrument, given that it identifies some land and its current phase.  Using a fiscal instrument to put a cost on keeping it in that phase has much merit.

A great debate is ongoing about whether &euro;310,000 is affordable but I do not believe that it is for people on an average wage.  What are our guests' views on the definition of \"affordable\"?<\/p> <p>  If it is not a matter of 10% social, 30% affordable and 60% market, do our guests believe we could move to a higher proportion of social and affordable in that policy?  How do we ensure we get the correct mix out of the giveaway of public lands to the LDA?  According to the summary of social housing assessments in 2018, 47% of the 72,000 households on local authority waiting lists are single-person households.  Of the more than 100,000 people who are homeless, just over 4,000 are single.  The national Housing First implementation plan, published last year, requires an additional 750 to 800 one-bedroom properties in order that people can move out of hostels and those places that are not good for anybody.  Housing First provides immediate access.  How do we ensure that in the transfer of land we all own today, the goals we need are achieved?

Is the only objective achieving the type of housing we need?<\/p> <p>  On permanent affordability, I like the idea but wonder what law needs to be in place to ensure that is the outcome of the transfer?

There was a 99-year lease on any properties bought as a result of subsidised mortgages.  Leasing was raised by both ESRI and the NESC.  I am interested in the idea, given that the State would not give away everything but rather retain an interest.  Perhaps we should consider models such as Vienna and Freiberg.

Social housing is permanently affordable at least up to the point of tenant purchase.  Some forms of social housing, for example housing associations, do not do tenant purchase so that is permanently affordable.  The idea we had on cost rental accommodation is that rents were pitched to suit middle income households.  That should also be permanently affordable.  While owner occupation is not a common model elsewhere, permanent affordability would mean having a mechanism in place to regulate the resale price for houses developed on that basis.  One would regulate the resale price and the extent of appreciation so that it is affordable for the next purchaser as well.  Leasing the land is a mechanism that would make this possible.  If the public body continued to own the lease, it could regulate the retail price.  In Singapore, the state plays a substantial role in supplying houses to the housing system.  It retains the land and has leases, as was said.  Closer to home, Amsterdam city council going way back adopted a policy of leasing the land rather than selling it.  Not all the housing was affordable but it did reduce speculation.  The city owns something like 80% of the land but it has moved now towards selling land.  It is a useful mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>To pick up on the issue of 40% social and affordable versus 60% open market, one of the concerning things for many of us is that social and affordable housing is not even mentioned in the heads of the Bill.  While the heads of the Bill say that the LDA must have regard to Government policy, it has no statutory requirement to deliver social and affordable housing.  Because it is being set up as an independent commercial entity, there is clear potential for a real conflict between having regard for Government policy, whatever that is, and the types of commercial decisions that an independent designated activities company will have to make.  This is one of the reasons some of us have raised the issue of NAMA and the publicly acknowledged conflict between its social remit and its commercial remit.<\/p> <p>  We also need to be really clear about the 40% target.  It is exactly as Dr. O'Connell indicates.  It is about facilitating the off-balance sheet nature of this.  It is one of the components of trying to ensure that it gets off-balance sheet.  In my interpretation, that jars directly with the repeated calls of both the NESC and the ESRI for a significant output, not just of social housing but particularly of affordable and cost rental accommodation.  Let us look at the figures.  The LDA is to have a remit to facilitate the delivery of 150,000 homes over 20 years.  At 10% social, that means 15,000 houses and at 30% affordable that makes 35,000 houses, and then there are 60% open market price houses, which is 90,000.  They sound like big numbers but on an annual basis, that means 750 social houses, 2,250 affordable houses, which could be 50:50 cost rental and whatever, and 4,500 open market price houses.  This is in the context of the national development plan target of 30,000 total house completions on an annual basis over the life cycle of that plan.  Some people think it needs to be 35,000 or whatever but let us take the figure of 30,000.  The LDA will be responsible for 10% of that, which is hardly the game changer the Government keeps talking about.<\/p> <p>  The big concern of this committee is that we want housing need met, in particular for those whose needs currently are not met by the market.  We are creating a mechanism that will be predominantly market in nature, to keep it off-balance sheet.  As a result, we are dramatically reducing the ability of the LDA to meet the social and affordable housing need, which the ESRI and NESC have been highlighting for quite some time.  In the case of NESC, as far back as 2005 it has been calling for affordable cost rental.  Without putting words in the witnesses' mouths, clearly what we are hearing from them is that housing need should be paramount and, while they are not getting into saying the figure of 40% should be at a higher or lower level, they are not disagreeing with the committee when we are saying it would be better if it was higher.  I do not think we need to stipulate the percentage in the legislation because different schemes can work in different ways.  If the legislation had provided that it should be the priority of the Land Development Agency to facilitate the delivery of social and affordable housing, that would have given it a different context.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.  I am also interested in their views on the potential conflict between the independent, commercial nature of a market operator to meet EUROSTAT's off-balance sheet rules and the non-market nature of social and affordable housing.  The whole point of social and affordable housing is that we are pulling out elements of the market from its delivery, such as land speculation and all the rest of it.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue of land value extraction although it is a little bit esoteric.  Part of the difficulty with O'Devaney Gardens, for example, is that Dublin City Council is at the mercy of a private consortium because it bid in a competitive tendering process.  Even though O'Devaney Gardens, strictly speaking, has no value in the sense that it is not up on the market for sale, if three, four or five large corporations are all bidding for it and if they all decide to put in an element of land value extraction over and above the profit margins, then Dublin City Council has no option but to select the best of those.  That appears to be what happened in O'Devaney Gardens with the Bartra Capital deal.  While I am not asking the witnesses to comment on that deal, given the fact that competitive tendering and competitive dialogue is actually going to set the final price, how do we ensure that in those competitive tendering processes, private interests are not allowed incorporate market value of the land for which they are not actually paying?<\/p> <p>  This leads to my other big concern with the LDA.  I really like the idea of active land management.  If this Bill created a strong, powerful, well resourced State agency to push other State agencies around and to acquire land because it was not being used in the most strategic way and to then engage with local authorities or the IDA about the best use of that land, it would be brilliant.  My big worry is that we are giving the LDA two jobs, namely, active land management and then the primary role in residential development.  We have lots of highly expert people in local authorities who, if only given the capacity and the resources, could be much better at that.  From the witnesses' experience of other jurisdictions, are the roles of land management and residential development always combined, are they separate or how does it work?<\/p> <p>  On credit, for Professor McQuinn and Dr. O'Toole, my big concern is less to do with credit being invested directly in land which is then hoarded, although that is a problem.  It is more about what is happening with investment decisions as a result of the macroprudential rules beginning to constrain house prices.  What we see happening, particularly in Dublin, is not that everybody is sitting on the land and keeping it vacant but that different types of investment decisions are being made, in particular build to rent, co-living, high-end student accommodation and hotels.  One reason they are doing that is they can extract more value; there are fewer constraints on what people pay in those cases than there are on household mortgage lending.<\/p><p>Should we be concerned about that?  What changes could be made to allow the LDA protect against that in the big urban centres?  Let us take Dublin 8 as an example.  Someone recently did an interesting 3D mapping exercise of what is being built there in those four categories: student, co-living, hotels and build-to-rent.  They are squeezing out standard residential development, let alone affordable accommodation.  I would like the witnesses from NESC to address the locational value mechanism mentioned in the 2018 report and enlighten the committee in that regard.  It is an interesting section that has not been touched on yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#O00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>It is not possible to specify exactly what the targets should be regarding the mix of housing and how much should be social and affordable.  In broad terms, however, we echo the view that the emphasis should be more on social and affordable housing.  Our research clearly identifies where the bottlenecks are in respect of affordability in the market and demand that is not being met at the moment.  In that sense, it is evident there is a need for greater emphasis on the social element.<\/p> <p>  We are then getting into the old issues of the structure, being off-balance sheet and meeting EUROSTAT regulations and requirements.  We have not examined in any great detail the specifics of how the vehicle would be set up and funded.  I reiterate, however, that our research shows a greater need for affordable housing in the market.  We have been articulating that for the past four or five years.  One of the first things that struck me when I moved to the institute and started researching the housing area was the great fall-off in the provision of social and affordable housing from 2008 onwards.  In broad terms, therefore, I agree with that assessment.  <\/p> <p>  I may have misunderstood the Deputy initially on the credit issue.  I have grasped it now regarding the relative attractiveness of residential accommodation versus other uses for the property such as student, co-living or commercial.  That question has arisen frequently during our interactions with people.  I refer to the issue of greater activity concerning the provision of commercial property as opposed to residential.  It may be being redressed a little now, but I am not certain.  <\/p> <p>  It is hard to see what can be done from a credit perspective.  Fiscal instruments could be used to make the provision of residential property more attractive than other types of construction activity.  I am not stating that is what the Deputy is suggesting, but those kinds of fiscal instruments have been used in the past but they come with serious health warnings.  Much work has been done to examine their impacts retrospectively and the role they may have played in the property bubble.  It is a difficult area and involves almost moving into the realm of micromanaging the market and trying to tilt construction activity in one direction more so than in another.  That is difficult to effect.  Residential prices are so high and we are having difficulty in meeting demand.  That goes back to issues on the supply side of the market, the high cost of providing property and what can be done to address that.  There may also be a connection with the changing nature of finance, as far as property development is concerned.  I refer to the knock-on implications that has had for the market.  <\/p> <p>  Returning to the Deputy's basic question, I share the view that we need significant emphasis on the provision of social and affordable housing in whatever way that can be achieved.  Regarding the weighting we might give that in respect of the need for a commercial return, which is evident given the structure and nature of the vehicle proposed, we favour a greater weighting being given to the social and affordable side of that equation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1570662000,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>Deputy Noel Rock resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>I will make a more general point.  It is clear that affordability will drive the value of land.  It is an instrument, so in a sense that is why Mr. Cahill made his reference.  This would require a wider decision, but if the part V requirement was increased, that would set the parameters.  I refer to a requirement to provide 20% social housing and that being strictly enforced.  People would have to take that into account if they were considering bidding on land, but that is a wider policy issue.  I am not sidestepping the Deputy's question on the 60:40 split, but it is worth noting that principle in housing policy.<\/p> <p>  The market-non-market distinction might not be quite so black and white.  The cost rental model in Austria has what is called a \"limited profit\".  It is not, therefore, the case that the 60% has to be completely market-based and extract full value, while a profit does not have to be made in the social and affordable area.  The Austrian example allows for a regulated return of approximately 3%.  Most of that is reinvested, but some of it can be taken out by the people putting in the equity.  There can, therefore, be a market element in that kind of model.  <\/p> <p>  It would be hoped, however, that the 60% side would not involve unfettered market exploitation to get the full value of the land.  Having listened to the dialogue with the LDA earlier, my sense it that will be part of what it will try to do.  I acknowledge O'Devaney Gardens is a poor example, but it should be ensured in future developments that the idea is that the private sector does not run riot.  How can that be done?  An agency can be created with people in it able to go toe to toe with the private sector.  That is what Transport for London, TfL, did.  It got people in the room who were expert at negotiating non-deals and at buying and selling real estate.  It was then able to negotiate, understand construction costs and ensure that it was getting good value for money.  The market-non-market polarisation, therefore, needs to be slightly nuanced and that needs to be reflected in how things work in future.  That should be done instead of a critique that takes 60% as negating the whole function and preventing delivery of what we need.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also asked about the locational value mechanism.

I will return to the issue of affordability later on but with regard to the transparency of the Agency, as outlined in the general scheme of the Bill, I think criteria such as freedom of information are listed in the second part of head 9.  In the context of our engagement last year with the Department, we will only have access to parliamentary questions on policy.  It raises certain issues for me because at the moment, we can get access to a significant amount of information about social and affordable housing, local authorities and AHBs such as how things are progressing.  With the establishment of this agency and this agency then being open to working with local authorities, that information will no longer be available to us.  I question the Minister's statement when we tried to get the cap for local authorities raised to &euro;6 million.  He questioned the ability of local authorities to do that yet he is handing &euro;1.25 billion to a land development agency with relatively no oversight.  What are the witnesses' comments on the oversight of the LDA?  One sees that the agency will be allowed to set up joint ventures and partnerships - all these separate bodies.  What access or oversight will we have?<\/p> <p>  Regarding head 9, we mentioned commercial return, which is emphasised significantly.  Even under this head, one will see a reference to pursuing joint ventures and profit-sharing arrangements to create investment vehicles.  Much of this seems to be geared towards profit and trying to get a commercial return as opposed to delivering social and affordable housing, which is our main objective.<\/p> <p>  Professor McQuinn mentioned freely available land as a critical point in delivering housing in general and affordability.  Land, including zoned land, is available.  We probably have zoned land of up to nine years.  I do not think it is a problem with land.  I think the problem is the lack of infrastructure on that land.  If our zoned land had the infrastructure, we might be able to look at vacant site levies being the critical thing to get that delivered.  At the moment, we are looking at a lot of zoned land that has no infrastructure to deliver housing.  What impact is the lack of infrastructure having on delivering affordability in the long term?<\/p> <p>  If this vehicle ends up being on balance sheet, it will have failed.  It will not be able to deliver what it set out to deliver.  It is a fundamental question with which we must grapple.  I do not know whether enough is being done at European level to emphasise the importance of social housing and that it should be looked at in an off-balance sheet situation and should not form part of that fiscal space because it is the single biggest social issue we face.  Europe needs to look at how it handles capital investment in social and affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#Q00600","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>It is very difficult for us to answer the question about transparency.  It is a key issue but I find it difficult to comment on the specifics about whether there will be oversight.  I share the Deputy's concern.  With any body like this, there needs to be oversight.  The fact that affordability is part of its core function helps protect against some of the potential excesses involving profits and joint ventures about which the Deputy is concerned.  If they are in the service of affordability, there are fewer concerns.<\/p> <p>  NESC would have looked at the issue of infrastructure because it is often a key bottleneck.  Going back to the point made by Mr. Cahill, getting funding for some of the infrastructure and creating the means to put the infrastructure in place are critical.  The LDA's ability to bring together some of the providers into the discussion about particular sites is an important step forward in that it will have that capacity to convene actors on the State side.<\/p> <p>  Regarding being on or off-balance sheet, for a long time we have been struck by the fact that Europe's position on investment in housing and its treatment in the fiscal space needs to be addressed, particularly as this has been a critical issue for a country like Ireland.  As we came out of the crisis, it was even more of a binding constraint in terms of our ability to invest so it is clearly a broader issue.  I agree with the Deputy that it is something that constrains our ability to invest in housing.  Having that binding constraint is unfortunate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>Do our guests have any idea as to how it could be addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#Q00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1156,"content":"<p>We were looking it in terms of the fiscal rules and whether there was space to see housing treated as an investment rather than expenditure and whether there is some dialogue at European level on that matter.

When I said that land should be freely available subject to infrastructure being available, the basic point is that we need land to be available for housing.  In countries where land is more freely available, by which I mean that it is ready for housing to be built on it, there is less fluctuation in prices.  Infrastructure is a key issue.  Some people have talked about the vacant site levy.  Different rates could apply depending on the different levels of infrastructure available for the properties concerned.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago I wrote about how European fiscal policy had been so poorly managed as far as the financial crisis was concerned.  I compared the response of the European authorities to what was done in, for example, the United States, which had a fiscal stimulus.  Some people may criticise the fiscal stimulus as not being sufficient but it compares well to European economic performance, which is certainly quite sluggish at present.  In the past ten years, Europe has been far slower in coming out of the financial downturn than the United States was.  Initially, even the UK came out of it more quickly.  There is a plausible case to be made for substantial fiscal stimulus, and housing would have been a logical component of that.  That should be considered going forward.  Monetary policy, as governed by the European Central Bank, is doing all that it can and more, especially under Mr. Draghi, to keep the European economy going with its accommodative monetary policy.  Its statements are clear that fiscal policy needs to start to support and promote economic activity.  Unfortunately, European fiscal policy has not responded in that fashion.  One could argue about the mechanisms, ways and means by which one could achieve that.  A Europe-wide fiscal response may require more co-ordination across member states with regard to taxation issues, which gives rise to certain issues here.  Nonetheless, I think there is a strong case to be made for a far more expansionary role of a Europe-wide fiscal stance.  The provision of social and affordable housing would be a logical component of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019101000002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1158,"content":"<p>We would not need the commercial strength and profitability in the LDA if this fiscal space was not hanging over us, with this on-off balance sheet matter.

It is a significant transfer and giveaway, as a Deputy said, of &euro;1.2 billion of public assets.  It is off balance sheet and, because of that, there is an interface with the market.

The IHF welcomes this opportunity to make a submission to the committee following the referral of the general scheme of the Payment of Wages (Amendment) Bill 2019 for pre-legislative scrutiny.  As the national organisation of the hotel and guesthouse sector in Ireland, the federation represents approximately 1,000 properties, which employ in the region of 60,000 people.  Let us be very clear at the outset.  The IHF view is that we fully support the payment of all tips and gratuities to staff; that each establishment should display clearly to staff and customers how tips, gratuities and service charges are treated; and that service charges levied by a business, as distinct from tips and gratuities, are part of business revenues and, as such, can be applied to meet all business costs, including salaries.<\/p> <p>  It is worth reflecting on the views expressed by the Low Pay Commission on this issue.  The Minister requested that the commission examine this area as part of its 2018 work programme and report its findings and any recommendations it might consider appropriate.  The commission, adhering to its evidence-based approach, instigated a consultation process with relevant stakeholders and also engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Revenue Commissioners.  Current practices in other jurisdictions were also examined.  In its report - LPC No. 10 of 2018 - the Low Pay Commission reached a number of conclusions regarding tips and gratuities in Ireland, including the following.  First, the commission does not believe that sufficient reliable data exists to prove that the issue of employers withholding employee tips is a significant problem in Ireland.  Second, the commission does not believe that legislation or regulation should be introduced in this area as the administrative and compliance costs involved would not be justified.  The IHF notes that agreement on the commission conclusions was unanimous, with all employer, trade union and independent members of the commission endorsing the conclusions as set out.<\/p> <p>  This is a complex area and if we reflect on the range of responses to the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017, we have an opportunity to ensure that key points of principle are clearly addressed in any proposed new legislation sponsored by Government.  Much of the language contained in the Bill was far too vague to meet the requirements of legal certainty, a core principle of legal drafting.  In the IHF's view, it would have given rise to confusion and uncertainty for employers and would have led to significant and unnecessary administrative and cost burdens for employers.<\/p> <p>  It is the IHF's view that cash tips, tips paid through a credit or payment card system and service charges are distinct from each other and, therefore, must be treated separately.  Cash tips are left at the discretion of the customer and the employer is currently not required to be involved in the distribution.  Tips paid through credit or payment cards are part of the books and records of a business and the employer has a clear responsibility to administer the distribution of and taxation on such tips.  An internal policy, collective agreement or code of practice is usually agreed at employment level on how best to share and distribute these tips.  A service charge is not a tip or gratuity.  A service charge is levied by the business on a customer, who does not have the right to determine the amount of the charge.  The customer, therefore, does not have the right or expectation to determine how the employer manages and treats this income stream.  A charge for service should not be the subject of this legislation as to do so would interfere in a contract between a business and a customer.<\/p> <p>  Tips or gratuities are entirely discretionary.  They are voluntarily left, gifted or added to the payment by a customer or a guest as a gesture of appreciation for the service they receive.  They are given in various forms.  Customers or guests might leave cash upon departure from a hotel; customers or guests might add a tip or gratuity to their payment when paying by other means, for example, by credit or payment card; customers or guests might indicate a department or specific member of staff to whom they wish the tip or gratuity to be left; and customers or guests might not indicate to whom or to which department they wish the tip or gratuity to be left.  If an employer volunteers to manage the distribution procedure, it would be appropriate for a clear policy to be available to relevant staff as part of their employment contract.<\/p><p>It is common in hotels that tips are pooled among the team, and occasionally management, depending on the situation.  For example, a guest may instruct that a tip is given to a particular employee as an acknowledgement of a job well done and that employee may be a member of the management team.  The tronc system of distributing tips was previously in widespread use in the hospitality sector but has now been largely eliminated.  Tronc schemes are fraught with difficulties and should, under no circumstances, be mandatory on the employer.<\/p><p> Criminal sanctions for alleged non-compliance are totally unnecessary.  The Oireachtas has a role in ensuring employment legislation does not impose an unfair burden on employers and, in particular, does not start to introduce criminal sanctions as a default position.  We understand that the area of health and safety should be regarded differently.  However, it is entirely excessive and disproportionate to make non-compliance with employment legislation a criminal offence and, in particular, in an area where, for the most part, employers are reluctant to become involved.  If an employee has an issue with an inappropriate or unlawful withholding of tips or gratuities by an employer who is involved in the distribution of tips or gratuities, they could simply bring a claim under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, as may be amended, to the WRC.<\/p><p> We fully support the payment of all tips and gratuities to staff.  However, we are strongly opposed to any legislation that: imposes any obligation on employers to be required to manage the distribution of tips and gratuities; seeks to impose a criminal sanction on an employer given the voluntary nature of tips and gratuities and the potential for injustice based on speculation as to what might have been the customer&rsquo;s intentions; and does not properly differentiate between a mandatory charge for service on the one hand and voluntary tips and gratuities on the other.<\/p><p> I thank members for the opportunity to make this submission.  We welcome an opportunity to make further submissions on this matter in the future based on the detail of any Bill that emerges.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1176,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us to this session of the joint committee to discuss this proposed legislation on tips and gratuities and to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on same.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Amy Sweetman, membership services and public affairs manager for the RAI.  The association was founded in 1970 with the goal of representing restaurants in Ireland on issues impacting the restaurant, hospitality and tourism industry.  Over the years, the association has sought to represent the views and interests of its now 2,500 plus members at a local and national level, as well as at an EU level through our membership of the EU umbrella body, the Confederation of National Associations of Hotels, Restaurants, Caf&eacute;s and Similar Establishments in the European Union and European Economic Area, HOTREC.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill.  We welcome the principle that tips and gratuities should not be used to make up contractual wages.  This is something that we have always advocated to our members and we welcome that it will, going forward, be stated in legislation.  One hospitality worker who does not get their tips is simply one too many.  We must highlight that the association has daily communication with our members through various means and continuously advocates and informs members of best employer practices and of employment legislation obligations.  This legislation will stamp out the bad behaviour of the few and renew public confidence in the many.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the distinction between tips, gratuities and service charges in this proposed legislation. Regarding head 6, obligation on certain employers to prominently display notice on tips, amendment No. 1, we welcome that customer, patron and employee will be made aware clearly, through display of public notice, the manner in which tips, gratuities and service charges are distributed on the premises.  However, subsection 2 references &quot;display (a) on menus or (b) at principal points of payment&quot;.  We suggest, given that menus are increasingly becoming more of a legal statement rather than a list of food options available, that the requirement be similar to the requirements in food safety legislation, that is, such information being displayed in a prominent location within the establishment that is easily accessed by members of the public, perhaps with a brief indication of the location of the information on the menu.  By way of example, a statement on a menu could be along the lines of: &quot;For more information on how tips, gratuities and service charges are handled in this business, please see public notice.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Section 4A(3) states: &quot;The Minister may make regulations to provide for the manner, means and form by which employers shall display the information referred to under subsection (2).&quot;  We ask that the Minister have regard for the fact that this notice will be required in a number of varying businesses, and as such, it is our hope that such a regulation may not be too prescriptive.  Some businesses within the requirement may not have menus, but a menu board on display, for example.  Head 6 refers to the obligation on employers to prominently display notice on tips and states under section 4A(1) that it &quot;applies to employers whose company is registered with the appropriate authorities as a licensed premises or business serving food or drink&quot;.  The section detailing the purpose of the above section outlines that display of a tipping policy:<\/p><blockquote>would be confined to businesses in the hospitality sector where food and drink is served to paying customers.  While there are other sectors where tips and gratuities are quite common, it is primarily in relation to service staff (waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff) that this issue has been raised as a problem that requires legislative intervention.<\/blockquote> <p>It is disappointing that the restaurant and hospitality sector has been singled out on this occasion.  As outlined in the Low Pay Commission report, there is practice of tips and gratuities in many other sectors, including, but not restricted to, couriers, taxis, hairdressing, beauty therapists and croupiers.  The question we would pose is: should employees and customers not also be made aware of what happens to tips in those sectors?<br\/><br\/>A number of statements have been made in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad about the non-compliance with employment law within our sector.  The WRC report of 2018 has been referenced on a number of occasions in debates on tips and gratuities and the statistic of a 67% rate of non-compliance has been referenced for our sector.  We wish for committee members to take note that based on how the WRC categorises sectors, food and drink is the applicable category for our members, indicating that pubs and takeaways, including convenience store delis, service station delis and fast food outlets are all included in this category.  We take issue with such statements, as while our members would fall under food and drink, the sector the RAI represents only includes full-service restaurants, hotel restaurants, gastro pubs, caf&eacute;s, golf club restaurants and cookery schools.  I encourage members to review the 2018 annual report of the WRC, specifically pages 41 through to 46 listing convictions.  The majority, if not all of those relating to the food and drink sector, do not fall under our membership.  Under a freedom of information request sent to the WRC on the issue of employees not receiving tips over the last five years, no employee has raised the issue to the commission as a complaint.

My party and I are very critical of the general scheme of the Bill because it does not aim to address the serious and widespread issues workers are experiencing.  I take issue with some of the contributions made by certain organisations, some of which are not represented at this meeting, on the extent of the problem.  There is a significant amount of evidence that workers have serious concerns and are experiencing the theft of what rightfully belongs to them.  The general scheme of the Bill really does nothing because it does not address the core issues surrounding the service charge, about which I have specific questions for Mr. Fenn and Mr. Cummins.  We know that under the National Minimum Wage Act, it is illegal to use tips to top up workers' pay.  That is a non-issue in terms of the general scheme of the Bill which, essentially, aims to ensure premises put up signs in the window on a voluntary basis.  That is certainly not acceptable.  I wish to hone in on comments Mr. Fenn made on the service charge.

I noticed that Mr. Cummins made a specific point about different sectors and stated his organisation only represented one sector of the food and drinks industry.  The Low Pay Commission stated it did not carry out a broad examination of how bad the position was in the restaurant industry.  As a result, its report does not stand on its own merits.  It does not really reflect what is happening because I know that certain unions consulted staff in restaurants and other businesses in Dublin city in the past week or so and found that many workers were not happy with their conditions or were very insecure in their terms of work.  Such insecurity arises from issues such as the fact that workers have no security in their first year of employment and can be sacked at any time, as well as the fact that some workers feel very intimidated.  It does not surprise me that few cases have been taken to the Workplace Relations Commission in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The situation at The Ivy restaurant which is nearby was all over the newspapers.  As such, it is not a surprise to anybody.  When I raised with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection the issue of tips being used to part-pay the difference between the national minimum wage and workers' contracted wages, she was quite clear that such a practice was illegal.  Within one month the restaurant mentioned extended its service charge of 12.5% for tables of five or more to all tables.  It effectively cut out the opportunity for workers to receive tips.  No one will leave a tip on top of a service charge because, as Deputy Brady pointed out, people assume the service charge goes to the worker at some stage.  With particular reference to the restaurant industry, do the delegates think a restaurant should be allowed to use a service charge for its own purposes when customers have the impression that the money will go to the worker responsible for their service?  It is a service charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#E00900","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

I am also concerned from the perspective of customers.  The Bill seems to suggest money that is floating around might still reach the staff.  There is very little money floating around.  Most people when they go into a restaurant make a decision on whether they should give a gratuity or a tip which they understand to be covered by a service charge.  I randomly asked six people who were not friends what they thought was meant by a service charge and every one of them said it was a tip.  Two of the six clarified that when a service charge was charged, they did not give a tip because they believed the service charge was a tip.  That was their understanding.  It is a view that is commonly understood by people in a restaurant.  Using that logic, there is a reason a service charge is applied in serving large groups.  I have spoken to restaurant and caf&eacute; owners who have told me that serving large groups requires a lot of more work and extra effort from staff.  They have said it is good that such work is recognised via the service charge and that they include it because they feel bad when a tip is not given.  Everybody understands the service charge is a tip.  If I were a customer, I would be concerned to hear that I entered into a deep contractual relationship every time I ordered a plate of pasta in a restaurant and hard luck on me.  How does one justify the fact that groups of five or six people are charged a service charge?  Is it the case that those attending birthday parties, large family groups or those who booked their Christmas dinner need to pay more for the service they receive in a restaurant?  Should the organisations state \"This is the charge for a large group\"?  Is the restaurant that believes large groups should pay more for food and use of chairs?  What is the justification for charging a service charge if it is not a tip?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#F00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>The Bill seeks to remove any confusion.

A business may decide to charge a service charge in certain instances, be it where service is complex or simple, but it is its decision.  All we are saying is that if a business decides to charge a service charge in its contract with its customer, it gets to decide what to do with it.  We suggest a business make clear to its customers what its tips, gratuities or service charge policy is.  Customers will then have a choice to make.  They can decide whether they want to go into a restaurant that does not give 100%, 95% or whatever the percentage is of the service charge charged to its staff.

The difficulty is that this is a complex area.  Sometimes people add their gratuity or tip in the form of an electronic payment.  This means it enters the books and records of the business.  Once it is on the books the employer clearly has a responsibility to look after it, to pay it to staff based on whatever agreement they have about how it is distributed and to account to the Revenue for tax.  It gets complex if the money is left on the table.  The employer has no hand, act or part in the distribution of that cash.  It is handled solely by the staff.  That means the employer has no responsibility and the staff handle it themselves.  That is the best way for it to be handled, full stop.  We get into a very vague area if the employer is placed under a legal obligation to have some control over it.  First, that brings money that may or may not be accountable into a system where the employer is legally responsible for it.  Second, when that money comes in it has to go on to the books and records.  Once there, it has the same status as money that comes in from a credit or debit card.  At the moment, when the employer gets the money he or she is responsible for it and has to deliver it to the staff.  We have no issue whatever with clarifying that.  Ideally, it should be in a contract of employment so that employees know what their rights are, what they are entitled to get and how this money is calculated and distributed.  There is no issue with that.<\/p> <p>  However, criminal sanctions forcing an employer to go around sweeping cash off tables and making the employer criminally responsible for not doing this correctly would create a very difficult administrative responsibility.  I am not sure that would serve the interests of the employees.  The employees themselves are best positioned to manage that cash.  They should manage it themselves.  If the employer chooses to take that money and manage it, he or she takes responsibility.  However, the employer should not be required to do so.  It is not the best outcome for the employees.  The best outcome for the employees is for them to manage the cash left on the tables.  That is the point we are making.  I hope I have made that clear. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>Nonetheless, if I pay for a group of six people and leave a 15% service charge in cash, the employer seems happy to absorb that 15% into the system.  There seems to be a slight contradiction between the two testimonies.  Mr. Fenn spoke about being clear to the customer, whereas Mr. Cummins made a plea for the notice to be kept separate so the menu is not overburdened with information.  In fact, he suggested wording on the menu telling customers to check a public notice for more information on how tips, gratuities and service charges are handled in the business in question.  That wording seems quite long.  It should be possible to simply provide the information in that many words.  Would that mean that if customers wonder if their money will go to the staff they will all parade across the restaurant to look at a notice in the corner?  The definition of service charge that has been put forward is startling and very different from the common understanding of a service charge.  Does Mr. Cummins believe it would be appropriate for a note to be added every time a service charge is mentioned, clarifying that it is not a tip or a gratuity and will not necessarily go to the person who served the meal?

I do not believe it is an issue, but if there is concern around whether or not a particular charge or price is being used to divert moneys away from staff then the best way to deal with that is to be open and clear about what the policy is in the restaurant in that regard.  The business - be it a restaurant or hotel  - may decide to tell the customer that it keeps all the service charge, which is one option.  The business may decide to tell the customer that all of the service charge goes to the employees.

It is hugely frustrating that most of the decent people who work in this sector do not have a right to be represented by their unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J00500","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1265,"content":"<p>In Ireland, every worker has the right to join a union, every employer has the right to recognise a union, every employer has the right not to recognise a union, and every employee has the right not to join a union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1266,"content":"<p>I am asking why.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J00700","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1267,"content":"<p>We have many members who engage at enterprise level with unions, and that works fine for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>No, that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J00900","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1270,"content":"<p>It is a fact that it is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J01100","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1271,"content":"<p>We look after members who engage with unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1272,"content":"<p>What about with the JLC?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J01300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>Please allow Mr. Fenn to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J01400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>The Chairman is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#J01500","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>The Senator asked us to comment on JLCs.  Those committees were completely frustrating to employers when they were in use.  There were some 800 determinations based on the outcome of the requirement or the ask of the unions.  Probably one or two were at the ask of the employers.  In theory, a JLC will have the employers' representatives', the employees' representatives and an independent chairman.  The independent chairman takes the submissions from both sides and then comes up with some kind of a recommendation.  That goes to the Labour Court and, with the new structure, it then has to go the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In the process of discovery in a previous case at the JLC, we found that the case submitted to the Labour Court did not include the employer's case.  Full stop.  There is no trust in how the JLCs work.  In addition, we now have the national minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission and the structures that deal with that aspect.  Within our industry we also have a structure, the quality employer programme, where we engage in what we believe to be best practice.  It is our wish to make our industry an industry of preference for people.  If we consider it from the macro point of view, in 2011 there was some 114,000 people employed in accommodation and food services, now there are 180,000 people employed.  When we gross that figure up into tourism, there are now 270,000 people employed in tourism in Ireland.  It is a massive success story.  That happens because employers look after their people, and they are the best people to look after their people.  If there is full employment Ireland, and if there is a massive increase in the amount of money going to the employees now, then this is a good thing.  Maybe not all employers are happy with that, but this is the way it is.  The reason we do not engage with JLCs is because those structures are for the past.

The primary remit of the Low Pay Commission is to make recommendations each year to the Minister on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage.<br\/><br\/>The national minimum wage establishes a pay floor below which no one should be expected to work.  The commission seeks to recommend rates that will help as many low-paid workers as possible without any significant adverse impact on employment or the economy.  While the primary role of the commission is to make recommendations on the national minimum wage we are also tasked, at the request of the Minster, to examine what is referred to as &ldquo;related matters&rdquo;.  Since its establishment, the commission has reported on a number of issues, such as the preponderance of women on the national minimum wage, the <i>sub minima<\/i>rates of the national minimum wage, the allowances provided for board and lodgings and, most recently and the subject of this discussion, current practices in regard to tips under the national minimum wage.<br\/><br\/>In February 2018, the Minister invited us to examine the practice in regard to tips and gratuities as part of our work programme for last year and to make any recommendations we might consider appropriate.  To help us prepare the report, we invited submissions from key stakeholders and individuals.  We also advertised for submissions from the public.  We engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Revenue Commissioners to gain further knowledge and insight into enforcement procedures and taxation matters, respectively.  We also examined practices in other jurisdictions and considered how they might be applied in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As with all of the commission's work, the consultation provided us with information that greatly assisted us in reaching our recommendations.  Some submissions felt that employees should have more control over their tips and others favoured codes of practice.  The Revenue Commissioners and the WRC were able to provide us with advice on the practicalities of introducing legislation in this area.  What was clear from all of our engagement with stakeholders was that legislation or over-regulation in this area could result in a number of unintended consequences, which could result in less take-home pay for those employees concerned.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Low Pay Commission's report reviews current practices and current legislation, sets out the consultation undertaken, the inputs received from Departments and agencies, a literature review, and then outlines our conclusions.  In order to better understand tipping practices and the options available to Governments, the commission also examined selected international tipping regimes to look at best practice in other countries.  The majority of submissions received by the commission advocated legislation focused on the hospitality sector.  However, the consultation process has shown that tipping practices are prevalent in a number of other sectors.  While there was broad agreement that the withholding of tips by employers is wrong, there was not agreement as to how this should be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Let me take members through the conclusions of the commission's report.<b><\/b>While a number of groups have conducted some <i>ad hoc<\/i>surveys in this area, the commission was of the view, that insufficient data exist to show that employers withholding tips is a significant problem in Ireland.  The commission concluded that regulation in this area could result in a number of unintended consequences, such as the reclassification of service charges, leading to a potential reduction in the take-home pay of low-paid employees.  We also received a clear message from the WRC that legislation in this area might not be enforceable.  The WRC emphasised that for enforcement to be viable and a conviction to be secured, it was essential to establish and clearly quantify the proportion of tips each employee is entitled to.  The WRC has stated that, in its view, a better approach than legislation would be to introduce a code of practice on tipping.  Furthermore, regarding legislation, while there was some support for legislation for the hospitality sector put forward in the submissions we received, the commission is of the view that this may not be appropriate for other sectors.  Essentially, a one-size-fits-all approach is not recommended.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The commission noted that the advantage of such an approach would be that a code of practice could be tailored to the specific requirements of the industry involved.  A code of practice could also ensure that both employer and employee interest groups are able to give input into the development of such a code and may therefore be able to take better account of issues as they exist on the ground.  The commission concluded that, based on the experience in the UK, there is the strong possibility that if a code of practice were to be introduced in Ireland, it would not have the desired result in terms of ensuring that employees receive a fair share of their tips.  The commission considered that there has not been a great deal of pressure from either employee or employer representative bodies to legislate for tipping or to alter current practices.  The commission noted that this may indicate that the systems currently in place were working relatively well and that any attempt to interfere may lead to unintended consequences or legislation that would be difficult to enforce.<br\/><br\/>The commission's report was agreed by all nine members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend.<\/p> <p>  Unite the Union welcomes legislation to protect the interest of all workers, particularly those working in low-paid and precarious employment.  The hospitality sector is one where low pay and job insecurity are major problems for workers.  Covering the cost of accommodation in the current economic climate requires a sufficient regular income for most people.  Unite the Union welcomed the passing of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which provides some protection to workers on low-hours contracts.  However, we believe more needs be done in a legislative framework to protect workers from exploitation, particularly those working in precarious employment, including those working in the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>  The nature of the hospitality sector reflects some of the worst employment conditions in the State.  It is a sector that is largely characterised by precarious employment, low pay, insecure and unsociable hours, exploitation and sexual harassment.  Many of those working in this sector are on short-term contracts and part-time hours and, as a consequence, many are not earning enough money to qualify for income tax.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue which is specific to the hospitality sector, and Unite the Union believes it is necessary to have robust legislation in place that will prevent an employer from withholding any part of a worker's wages, including any monetary gifts received as tips or gratuities.<\/p><p>Furthermore, we believe that workers should have a legal right to those tips and criminal sanctions should be in place for any employer who engages in fraudulently confiscating them for any reason, including using them to make up the contracted wages.<\/p><p> Tips are confiscated from workers in the hospitality sector for myriad reasons, including to make up for breakages, a slow night or till shortages.  The gratuity paid by a customer to service staff is not intended for any of those purposes.  Gratuities are gifts from customers to service staff and should be treated as such.  Monetary gifts of this nature and size are not and should not be considered taxable income.  There is no need for the involvement of Revenue.  The system of tipping staff works without difficulty in the pub and bar trade, where neither employers nor Revenue collectors are involved in the transaction between their customers and lounge or floor staff.<\/p><p> Unite does not agree with the findings of the Low Pay Commission in the context of placing the protection of tips on a legislative footing and believes that the research conducted by the Low Pay Commission was insufficient.  Unite wants to see the introduction of better rates of pay in the sector.  However, the insecurity and part-time hours that are common mean that many workers inevitably rely on tips in order to make ends meet.<\/p><p> Unite supports the legislation drafted by Senator Gavan, namely, the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017.  We feel that the Bill, situated in the framework of employment protection legislation, is adequate to give workers in the hospitality sector a right to tips and gratuities that they earn, is robust in terms of sanctions for rogue employers and provides a mandatory requirement for employers to display their policy publicly, making it transparent for staff and customers.  A clear commitment put on display by management outlining its policy will send a clear message to customers, encourage good working practice and benefit those good employers who do not engage in stealing from their staff.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal represents a step back from Senator Gavan's Bill.  It does not ensure workers a legal right to tips or provide a criminal sanction for bad employers who steal from employees.  The Senator's Bill has been passed in the Seanad and has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Unite would like to see it progress further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browne.

In fact, it contradicts what has been stated by Fine Gael in various new media to the effect that the proposed legislation would give a legal right to tips for workers and staff.  This is simply not true.  The proposed legislation does not go anywhere towards addressing employees' right to tips, the lack of transparency for staff about what happens to their tips or, and equally importantly, transparency for the general public as to where their tips go.  There is no legal protection for employees regarding tips being proposed in this proposed legislation.  To propose that a bad employer would no longer be able to use a tip as a top-up to a contracted wage is a positive step, but it still allows for a bad employer to withhold that tip money to use for other business purposes, such as breakages, walkouts and entertainment.  The general scheme of the Bill is shockingly silent on how tips should or could be distributed.  Our extensive anecdotal evidence, and emerging independent empirical evidence, is that using tips to top up wages is a relatively minor issue compared to other reasons for withholding tips or, indeed, no reason at all besides the will of the employer.  The proposed Bill will change nothing for vulnerable hospitality workers who are having their tips regularly stolen from them.  In fact, it could mean that, because the employer cannot top up wages with the tip, the staff could end up back on the minimum wage with still no protection or transparency as regards their tip money.<br\/><br\/>Our campaign research has shown us that not all employers engage in withholding tip money, but since there is little or no transparency in the distribution of tips, it is unclear to employees what percentage of tips they are actually receiving, with some indicating that, on a busy week, they would receive the same tip money as on a slow week.  This situation is enough to justify a definitive change in legislation to address this blind spot on the legal ownership of tips.  Restaurants in Galway have endorsed and supported our campaign because they believe that legal clarity is required and only fair where tips are concerned.  We suggest that the proposed Bill does not go far enough for workers, for the trade unions who represent them and for good employers within the sector.<br\/><br\/>This is a &euro;5 billion euro sector, but one that has the highest percentage of minimum wage workers, who are the lowest paid and vulnerable workers in the economy.  While we understand that tipping is arbitrary and discretionary and no substitute for a living wage, we are asking the committee to ensure that employees are able to take home the money that they actually earn.  While we welcome the opportunity to discuss the general scheme of the Bill, other legislation that would address the concerns of workers is being held up in this very establishment.<br\/><br\/>I wish to take this opportunity to address some of the criticisms of the proposed Bill.  The Low Pay Commission report issued recommendations without adequate consultation with workers or in-depth research into the sector, which my colleague will comment on in greater detail.  We disagree with the Minister that this legislation is dealing with the more contentious issues relating to the treatment of tips, as we believe that it is more contentious that employees, under this legislation, would still not have a right to their tips.  We also believe that the Private Members' Bill should not be allowed to be stalled in favour of this proposed Bill because of so-called potential unanticipated consequences.  The unintended consequences for workers employed in this sector is not being able to pay rent, put fuel in their cars or continue in college because the tips they rely on - because they have to - are taken away from them with no recourse of action or right to resolve this.<br\/><br\/>Our estimates suggest that workers will not be faced with a massive tax bill by Revenue, given that their hours of work and earnings are such that the declaration of their tips for tax would barely raise them above the tax threshold.  We have heard that the cost of the Private Members' Bill for the WRC and labour inspections would be too high for the Exchequer, yet the Minister&rsquo;s office suggests that its own proposed amending legislation would be close to cost-neutral.<br\/><br\/>Our campaign is clear.  It calls for greater transparency in the appropriation and distribution of tips in the hospitality sector and that employees have a right to their tips.  How might that work?  An example of how this might be implemented and deal with the transparency issue is the area of card tips.  Acknowledging that we are moving towards a cashless society, with more and more tips being paid by card, securing at the very least the right to card tips for employees would address the issues raised at this meeting, those being, transparency in the system and the right to tips.  It would provide transparency to customers, who would know that the tip on the card would be received by workers, which is not the case currently.  It wold provide transparency for staff who would have a record of tips paid through the card system, which could then be transferred to payroll and distributed in an agreed manner among the staff.  It would provide transparency for employers, who would know that customers deliberately made a payment on their card intended for the staff.  With the card tips separated out, they could be seamlessly transferred to the payroll system, from which it would be distributed in an agreed and fair manner based on a <i>pro rata<\/i>of working hours, with tax already paid via payroll.  The transparency of such a system would mean the sticker of notice on tips policy would have genuine legitimacy.  As the payments would already have been recorded, there would be little additional cost to the employer, and this system would also provide evidence of practice.<br\/><br\/>This provision would bring the Minister&rsquo;s proposed Bill a little closer to giving workers protection of their tips and transparency for customers, and be something good employers would surely support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clement Shevlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Shevlin.

There was a concern in the commission that if legislation was introduced the typical service charge of 10% or 15% might be reduced.  That could affect the take home pay of workers in particular cases.  That was a big concern.  There is no dispute among the members of the commission about what is the right thing to do here.  The question is what is the best way of ensuring that it is done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>Perhaps the union representatives will address that specific point.

That is not helpful.  It is very confusing and open to arbitrary interpretation by employers.  We would welcome a definition and greater clarity in that respect.  A suggestion was made that the employers should provide clarity either through public display of a notice or a notice on the menu stating how they treat the service charge and whether it goes to the employees.  For argument's sake, an employer could say, either on a public notice or on the menu, that all the service charge goes to his or her employees, but that does not mean it goes as a tip in addition to their contracted salary as it could go to making up their contracted salary.

This comes with two words, \"service charge\".  They were quite adamant, in fact I thought they were lobbying for Senator Gavan's Bill, and all in agreement in saying that tips should go to the employee, yet they do not want progress made on that in legislation.  They are supporting a Bill that does not provide that.  Doing so is wish-wash, while at the same time telling legislators in the legislative Chambers that they have a business contract with customers, which is official and not to be touched.  Legislators can do what they like and give them their tips all day long, but they cannot touch this with no transparency either for the public or for the worker in the sector.  As the Chairman said, in any place where there is a service charge there are fewer tips for the workers there.

It is unfortunate that it did not conduct a survey or interview people.  Going to unions to ask about this issue is problematic because the sector is very much non-unionised and it is an area in which it is notoriously difficult to organise owing to the nature of the work involved, but we have attempted to do it.  In the past fortnight we have been all around Dublin city centre talking to workers.  One member who worked in the sector for 11 years and is present in the Visitors' Gallery would say that of the nine places in which she worked only one gave her her tips, in other words, eight did not.  That is the experience she is picking up from others on the ground.  People are saying that when they go into a restaurant and ask directly what is the workers' experience, they are told everything we outlined in the opening statement.  Apart from the theft of wages through holding on to tips, there is insecurity in the hours and shifts worked which change constantly.  It is used as a means of control.  Sexual harassment is a huge issue for female workers in the sector.  There is also the question of safety in getting home from work.  Sometimes, if workers do not receive their tips, they cannot afford to take a taxi home late at night.  The feedback we have received emphasises the precarious nature of the employment.  Other research has been undertaken.  Sinn F&eacute;in undertook a survey, as has SIPTU.  As Dr. Curran is probably the expert and has done a lot of work on the issue, I might ask her to explain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhona McCord"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>I am an academic at NUI Galway and obsessed with data.  When the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, said on national radio that employers in the hospitality sector, in the main, treated their staff the way one would like members of one's family to be treated, it was very frustrating as she had no evidence to support that statement.  Until recently we have had very little evidence to refute it.  I have some sympathy for the Low Pay Commission because, as has been mentioned, while it did consult union representatives, the sector is largely non-unionised.  Therefore, how does one get at the people most affected?  The screamingly silent voice in the Low Pay Commission's report is that of the workers.  <\/p> <p>  I have embarked on a path to try to address the lack of empirical independent evidence on working conditions in the hospitality sector.  It is part of a research agenda that is ongoing and it is revealing shocking levels of ill-treatment and the abuse of workers' rights.  I have said repeatedly that the non-payment of tips is only the tip of the iceberg.  My research addresses the issue of tips, but beyond it there is a culture of ill-treatment within the hospitality sector.  While we had some anecdotal evidence - most people on the street had an awareness of it - we had no solid evidence.  <\/p> <p>  From my research undertaken recently, 76% of respondents had experienced verbal abuse, either sometimes or often; 64% had experienced psychological abuse, either sometimes or often; while 15% had experienced physical abuse, either sometimes or often.  That is a low number, but what number would anyone care to see for the number of people experiencing physical abuse, either sometimes or often?  When asked when they were abused and who was the likely perpetrator, the responses were overwhelmingly that it was by someone in a position of power such as a chef, an owner or a manager.  Respondents were asked to whom did they report the abuse and overwhelmingly the answer was \"nobody\".  Those who had reported it were asked what was the outcome.  Only 15% said action had been taken to address it.  <\/p> <p>  I am referring to survey data.  The survey was comprehensive and included 38 questions.  <\/p> <p>  Sexual harassment is prevalent.  Some 55% of 257 respondents had witnessed or experienced harassment.  The most common forms of harassment were sexual, based on age or race.  Some 63% had witnessed or experienced bullying.  Some 48% said they have no access whatsoever to a voice in the workplace.  Clearly, they are crying out for voice.  <\/p> <p>  In the final question in the survey respondents were asked to leave their details if they were willing to speak to the researcher.  I had hoped for ten or 15 to go into more depth but 100 left their details.  That sent me into a panic as I had no resources or funding in carrying out the research, but I wanted to give a voice to anyone who wanted to have one.  I have offered people the opportunity to send me an audio file in responding to three questions: what do they like about working in the hospitality sector?  What do they not like about it?  Would they like to tell me about an incident in which they felt they had been unfairly or badly treated and what happened?  What action did they take?  What was the outcome and how did it make them feel?  If people do not want to make an audio file, I will meet them face to face.  I have travelled around the country to meet them.  I have been researching for three decades and never conducted research that has kept me awake at night.  The people in question are crying out for a voice and protection.<\/p> <p>  Focusing specifically on tips, 23% of respondents said they were kept in whole or in part by management.  Some 47% said there was some system in place for distributing tips, but it was unclear or not considered to be fair.  When asked for what tips were used, the responses included that they were used to cover the cost of the staff party which sometimes did not even happen, to cover the payment of a Christmas bonus - the relationship between the tips and the bonus paid was not clear - to top up the till, to pay for newspapers, to pay for walkouts and to pay for breakages.  Not one person said tips were used to supplement their wages.  <\/p> <p>  The Bill proposed by the Minister addresses something which, from my research and that undertaken by the Union of Students in Ireland and the Galway Hospitality Campaign, is a non-issue.  There is a massive issue about tips being stolen from employees.  I noted that the employer bodies had taken exception to use of the term \"stolen\", but what does one call it when money intended for one person is taken by another?  <\/p> <p>  As well as asking discrete questions such as whether workers had received a fair share of tips, respondents were invited to submit more detail.  The average time devoted to responding to the survey was 20 minutes, which is comprehensive in a world where people do not like taking surveys and their average attention span is 2.5 minutes.  Many gave a great deal of data and are continuing to do so on the audio files and in the interviews I have been conducting.  One of my favourite quotes was that, according to managers, all of the tips in the establishment were given to a children's hospital, but the respondent had never seen any proof of this and that it was widely believed to be a lie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>That was very helpful.

The understanding of the Low Pay Commission, as I am hearing it from him, is that service charges were effectively gratuities and were destined for the worker.  One of the commission's concerns was that the level of that gratuity through a service charge might be reduced and a figure of 10% was mentioned.  Given that concern at the time, how much more concerned is the Low Pay Commission by the proposal to reclassify services charges as not being gratuities and in no way linked to the worker?

It could express concern about what is being reclassified by the hoteliers and restaurant owners.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Curran is right that only 7% of workers in the hospitality industry are members of trade unions.<\/p><p>A targeted campaign is being conducted by the Unite union whereby it is going into workplaces, talking to workers and encouraging them to get active and raise their voices.  A meeting will be held on Wednesday, 16 October in Wynn's Hotel and we hope large numbers of workers will attend and give that screaming, silent frustration a voice.  That said, it is going to be very difficult to organise.  Julia, who is with us today, worked in the Ivy restaurant but was sacked for joining a union.  She is now organising the hospitality sector in Dublin.  Her experiences in the restaurant trade were both good and bad but mainly bad.  There is a real need for the Legislature to pass a Bill that is worth the paper it is written on.  Hopefully, the Low Pay Commission will review the report it prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#O02900","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570662000,"counter":1334,"content":"<p>Would anybody like to comment on those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019101000002#P00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570662000,"counter":1335,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I have to leave now because I have to catch a train.

It is suggested that a tip is not a tip when it is a service charge, depending on the employer but that leads to confusion, a lack of clarity and is open to interpretation by the employer.  This current Bill does not give the clarity required in that respect.  If I get into a taxi, I will give the driver a tip, unless he or she is particularly rude or is driving dangerously.  In the vast majority of cases, I will give the driver a tip.  If I order a pizza or a curry to be delivered to my door, notwithstanding the fact that there is a delivery charge, I will give the delivery driver a tip.  There is no issue or problem with that because there is no opportunity for a third party, namely, the employer, to intervene or interfere in that transaction.  It only becomes a problem when the employer has an opportunity to interfere and intervene in the transaction and then one cannot be assured that the person for whom the tip is intended will actually receive it.  That is the issue and the problem.  We need regulation and legislation in respect of that and with all due respect, the Government's Bill does not provide what is needed.
