I understand Covid has been difficult for everyone.  I have asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to come down to Carlow and I am also asking the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, to come to Carlow to meet the staff and see the conditions that they are in.  I was fortunate last summer because the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, was in Carlow and visited the base.  I also had a virtual meeting with An Taoiseach recently to highlight just how serious the situation is.<\/p>  <p>  I will give a little bit of the background.  My understanding is the HSE is committed to a parcel of land called Kelvin Grove for the National Ambulance Service, NAS, to get a design 2 ambulance base.  However, the money is not committed and I seek an update on that.  I am committed to resolving what is a very serious issue in Carlow.  I have worn a path to the Taoiseach's door and, of course, to the Minister's door, as I will do with the Minister of State as well.  It is important that we keep communicating and get an update on this serious issue.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise these paramedics who are doing a great job in Carlow.  The base is in a prefabricated structure which is part of a building that was a delivery unit in St. Dympna's Hospital.  There are no training facilities there and their store is adjacent to a methadone clinic.  The staff are professionals and deserve to be treated as such.  I believe that if it were a private facility, it would be shut down today.  I understand that there are some legacy issues and this has been going on for a few years.  However, we saw that there was an extra &euro;10 million in the budget.  Yet, there seems to be a slowness in capital projects.  The site should be moved on more quickly because it is HSE land.  <\/p>  <p>  When I originally brought this up a few years ago, the talk from the different Departments was that there was going to be an extension onto a building where the prefabricated structure that serves as the paramedic base is located at St. Dympna's.  We have a beautiful building there and it is all stone.  It is called St. Dympna's Hospital and we always call it that.  While there was to be a build-on there, in the past few years we got word that the plan had changed and the paramedics were going to get a new base on the Kelvin Grove site.  It right across the road, by the way, so it is very well situated.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like a full commitment to know that there will be a new base on the Kelvin Grove site.  There have been huge issues of confusion around if it will be a build on the site they are on at present or if it will be at Kelvin Grove.  It is important that we get that decided.<\/p>  <p>  I raise another issue.  As the base is well situated in the centre of town, there often will be ambulances outside when people pass by.  However, if someone rings for an ambulance, they cannot get one because the ambulance paramedics have perhaps been moved to a different part of the country because, as the Minister of State knows, the system as changed.  I will bring that up in my next slot.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge issues.  The lack of communication with the Department and even to myself, the ambulance paramedics and the people of Carlow is an issue.  We need to have a base that is fit for purpose.  Our ambulance paramedics deserve a proper ambulance base.  It is only right that we now get that funding and a new base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600003#A00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1645002720,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murnane O&rsquo;Connor for raising the issue of replacing the current ambulance base, which is located at the Carlow health services complex at St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital, Carlow town.<\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service is the statutory pre-hospital emergency and intermediate care provider for the State and it seeks to serve the needs of patients and the public as part of an integrated health system, through the provision of high quality, safe and patient-centred services.  Carlow ambulance base is an integral part of the ambulance service and has two emergency ambulances on duty at any one time.  The base is supported by NAS resources from surrounding ambulance stations, including Baltinglass, Athy, Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Enniscorthy.  Dynamic deployment of available resources operates on an area and national basis, rather than a county or geographical boundary basis, to ensure optimum resource use as the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of the incident.  The priority of dynamic deployment is patient health and welfare in the context of service delivery, which means that resources cannot be confined by county boundaries, barriers or borders.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service operates a comprehensive safety management system across all of its premises across the South and continues to work collaboratively with staff and HSE estates and external providers to ensure that any concerns or issues that occur are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Given the work entailed and the timeline to move from identification and assessment of a suitable alternative site to the completion of works and building handover, remedial and refurbishment works at the existing station have been carried out to address shortcomings in relation to health and safety requirements.  Remedial works to the value of approximately &euro;50,000 were carried out at Carlow ambulance base in 2020.  These works addressed requirements to ensure the ambulance base was a safe place of work and included a list of maintenance-type work to doors, walls, floor covering and minor leaks, with full certification of electrical and fire safety systems.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021 the National Ambulance Service completed a detailed prioritisation assessment for all ambulance stations across the country.  The NAS is working with the HSE in planning a future replacement for the current facility.<\/p> <p>The HSE has identified Kelvin Grove as a possible suitable site and is currently procuring a design team for another project on the Kelvin Grove site.  The design team will prepare a development control plan for the site to include two other facilities including the proposed ambulance base.  When this site appraisal is completed, the HSE will be in a position to develop a capital submission for a new ambulance base.  Capital funding for the project will be determined in accordance with the overall prioritisation planning for all ambulance stations that require replacement, major refurbishment or expansion.

In regard to ambulance services, the people of Carlow have had delays in their ambulance services because as the Minister of State is aware, all ambulance calls are now managed through the central ambulance and emergency operations centre, which is supposed to ensure that the most urgent calls get the highest priority response, regardless of the location of the ambulance vehicles or bases.  That is a problem as Carlow does not have an emergency response support because our local hospital is in Kilkenny.  We do not have a fit-for-purpose building.  There are issues within the ambulance services.  We need more ambulances, or we need the two that are based there not to actually leave the county.  There is absolutely no commitment in the Minister of State's reply other than saying that the HSE is looking at a site in Kelvin Grove and that it is possible that it could happen.  This is unacceptable.  This is going on for years.  We have ambulance paramedics in Carlow in a prefab, in 2022.  I am raging.  This needs to be sorted as urgently as possible.  My understanding is that a list is being done on ambulance bases, seemingly numbered one to ten, on which Carlow is number two on the list.  That is not good enough.  I ask the Minister of State to go to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, as I will.  I will be going to the Taoiseach.  I want a firm commitment from the National Ambulance Service, the HSE and the Minister that we are going to get the build in Kelvin Grove.  There is another building going on Kelvin Grove, that is right.  My understanding is that it is at design stage at the moment but we need to get this building.

Indeed it is a very topical issue.  We have seen reports recently in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>in regard to reported problems in the Matt Talbot Adolescent Services, MTAS, in Cork.  It reported that the HSE commissioned a major review of the operations on foot of a number of protected disclosures.  From that it is my understanding that the review was conducted by two external social care consultants but that their final report was not published.  Some concerns were that it could have been too damning.  One of the issues arising out of this which I am interested in with regard to the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill was that one of the women who reportedly made that protected disclosure had been made redundant.  This is something that arose out of that and about which I have been questioned.  Will the Minister advise, in respect of a hearing of a person who fights and awaits a hearing before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC ,or the Labour Court, whether, if the new Bill is enacted, that hearing then will take place under the new protected disclosures regime?

It is a Cork thing this morning, for some reason.  In 2019 there was a chemical explosion in a factory in Cork.  It is well documented.  It was documented by the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  A protected disclosure was lodged.  Obviously there is a health and safety procedure and it went to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  It was the first time I worked on a protected disclosure where it went all the way up to the top and came back down to say the issues were resolved.  Unfortunately at the same time, 60 more complaints had gone in.  It has escalated again now and those people who made the protected disclosure, those who were injured in those accidents, have now been faced with expulsion and harassment, such things as we spoke of yesterday during the debate on the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill.  I approached the T&aacute;naiste a number of weeks ago and in fairness he came back to me.  Obviously the matter is within the remit of the Health and Safety Authority but I briefly explained the issue to him.  This is where the crux is with our protected disclosure law at present.  There is still no mechanism to see whether the reported incident has been resolved and if the people are being protected.  More importantly, I have now found out through that last protected disclosure that the HSA has stated the issues have been resolved, when in fact they have not.  As matters stand at the moment, is there any independent body that can carry out an investigation into the HSA?  It is a very serious matter.  This is not an anti-jobs or a point-scoring mission.  This was the subject of a Cork City Council motion a number of years ago.  The health and safety of people in the area are put at risk.  I spoke to the county fire officers on this and I can say there is an ingredient being used in this factory called titanium dust.  If that catches fire and goes up our fire service does not have the capability to put the fires out.  These are the safety concerns that were raised during the protected disclosure and unfortunately, I reiterate, when it was originally given to the HSA in 2020, which is not too long ago, the HSA stated that all issues were resolved.  Now, however, the same people are coming to me to explain that the issues have not been resolved.  Some of the health and safety issues have been ignored, or not addressed properly, but the people who have been at the forefront of this making protected disclosures are being punished.  How do we sort that out between management of the company, the HSA and those whistleblowers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600004#B00600","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1645003320,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and for their contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill yesterday in the House.  I look forward to working with them in a spirit of co-operation, as I said yesterday, on the passage of this Bill over the months ahead.  Many of the issues they raised this morning are the very issues we need to tease out in considerable detail on Committee and Report Stages.  We in this House can all agree on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.  We all recognise fully the vital role they play in a democratic society.  We are all aware of individual cases in recent years where people who have had the courage to speak up have unfortunately paid a personal price.<\/p> <p>While the existing Act served, and continues to serve, a purpose, it is an Act of its time.  It is now eight years old and we have to accept that we have learned a considerable amount from our experience of the operation of the Act over the last eight years.  I reassure the Deputies that not only are we using this Bill to transpose the EU directive but that we are also seeking to go further.  We are taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to improve and modernise our regime for protected disclosures and to centrally improve protections for whistleblowers.  <\/p> <p> The Bill goes much further than our existing legislation.  For example, it significantly widens the range of persons entitled to protection for speaking up to include volunteers, shareholders, board members and job applicants.  It will require many employers to establish formal channels and procedures for their workers to report concerns about wrongdoing.  It requires recipients of disclosures to take highly specific steps within clear timelines to follow up on the reports they receive.  Those steps are not laid out in the current Act.  When enacted, the new Bill will place clear obligations on those who are receiving these protected disclosures as to the steps they must take and when those steps must be taken.  Fundamentally, the Bill provides for the reversal of the burden of proof.  Employers will have to prove that the alleged act of penalisation was not undertaken because the worker made a protected disclosure.  That is a very significant shift in position that I believe will prove to be incredibly helpful over the period ahead.  Offences relating to contraventions of the Act are also set out.  <\/p> <p> As I said, we are using this Bill to address issues that arose in the context of the operation of the existing Act.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a protected disclosures commissioner, who will be the Ombudsman.  The commissioner's officer will have three key roles, one of which will be to assist persons in making an external report to a prescribed person by directing them to the most appropriate prescribed person.  With over 100 regulatory bodies currently designated as prescribed persons, it is not always clear to persons reporting which prescribed person they should report to.  It will also receive all reports made to Ministers and transmit them to the most appropriate authority for assessment and follow-up.  It will also act as a prescribed person of last resort and directly follow up on any reports where there is no prescribed person or other suitable authority competent to follow up on the matter reported.<\/p> <p> I will now deal with two of the issues the Deputies have just raised.  I read the report from the Oireachtas joint committee and we will have to carefully consider and tease out the issue of retrospective application.  I am engaging with the Attorney General.  I want to go as far as I possibly can to ensure the protections we are providing for in the new Bill will apply to those already in the system who have made protected disclosures.  However, I need to tease that issue out on the basis of legal advice.  I look forward to discussing that issue in detail.  We will ensure that there is follow-through with regard to protected disclosures that are made, that there will be an end point, and that people will know where they stand at the end of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600004#B00700","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645003920,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It has been great to see everyone working very well together on this particular Bill.

I welcome the fact that the Minister has said he is looking at existing cases because we do not want them to get lost and not be looked after.  The reversal of the burden of proof is a game changer because most of these protected disclosures were not made lightly.

I know that many whistleblowers who have made protected disclosures are looking to this Bill with hope.  They see it as an opportunity to improve the outlook for them and to improve the outcome they are likely to get from the process.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to highlight to people that there are already supports there, including the Transparency International Ireland helpline.  That organisation has a very useful guide on its website to support whistleblowers.  As the Deputies will know, there are provisions under the existing Act for taking a case to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Under sections 12 and 13, any person who suffers any form of penalisation other than dismissal, for example, harassment, ostracism, transfer of duties, demotion and so on, can make a complaint to the WRC.  Any person who has been dismissed can bring a case under section 11 of the Act.  The WRC will examine each case in detail and on its own merits and, as the Deputies will know, it can make an award of up to five times the salary of the person concerned.  There are existing protections there and it is important that we make that clear to people.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept that issues have arisen in the context of the existing legislation and that we need to improve upon these.  I look forward to working with the Deputies opposite and all other colleagues in the House in that regard.  My own agenda is to modernise the system of protected disclosures in Ireland and to extend protections to those who have the courage to speak up and call out wrongdoing to the greatest extent possible and to ensure they are supported.

The decision in Galway on Monday night is the catalyst for a discussion on how we can achieve our climate ambitions.  We are here to talk about a fundamental challenge we face.  In the past 18 months, I have been privileged to chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  We shepherded generational legislation through the D&aacute;il and Seanad and wrote reports on the pertinent challenges associated with climate change and climate action.  I am proud of my colleagues on the committee.  They have worked tirelessly towards our common goal and continue to do so.  While we do not always agree on the approach or on the detail, the fundamental strand running through the work of all members is their seriousness about the challenge we face.  Across all political persuasions, week in and week out, my colleagues have done their very best.  I can ask no more of them.<\/p>  <p>  I have been concerned for some time that the conversations that have been taking place in our committee have not echoed across our society and that our ambition is not reflected by decision-makers in local government.  The decision of Galway City Council on Monday night shows this to be true.  It was with great disappointment that I learned the news that the council had opted not to install a trial cycle lane in Salthill, citing a myriad of dubious excuses which, to my mind, amounted to a simple reluctance to remove on-street car parking.<\/p> <p>We can talk all we like about the need for climate action and for ambitious targets, and these are very important conversations, but not enough conversations are taking place about the measures that will be required to achieve those targets.  It is clear that not enough people are on board with the kinds of measures that will be required.  The proposed Salthill cycle lane was a small project, and seemingly a simple one.  It was a trial of a temporary cycle lane that could be improved and evaluated.  It was to be just a step towards creating a full network of safe cycleways in Galway, just as will be done in every town and city in Ireland in order that people will be able to choose to cycle rather than to drive.<\/p> <p> Nearly 40% of transport emissions in Ireland are caused by cars driving short journeys.  Many of these journeys could very easily be done by walking or by bike if it was safe and attractive to do so.  It is, however, neither safe nor attractive, and people drive these short distances because we have not provided these networks.  Most, if not all, of our towns and cities are a car-clogged mess.  The more people who drive, the more difficult it is to put in the infrastructure and to make walking and cycling safe.  It is a vicious circle that we must and can break.  This means taking decisions that amount to change, and which would reallocate road space away from cars.  Many of the people who are stuck in cars now will be the cyclists of the future.  They are the kids being driven to school, the elderly going to a medical appointment, the person going to get the groceries, the mass goers, the commuters and those going to socialise in town.  We have seen elsewhere in Ireland that this transition from car dependency can happen, whether it is in Dublin, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, or in my home city of Limerick.  We can point to brave decisions taken by councils that have led to it being safe for people to choose walking and cycling.  Unfortunately, these are the exception rather than the rule.  We must take a very serious look at the role of local government in delivering this kind of urgent climate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600005#C00500","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645004520,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I apologise that the Minister is unable to be here himself and he has asked me to respond to this matter.  I listened with great interest to what the Deputy said about the situation in Galway.  While I am a very strong supporter of more cycle lanes everywhere I cannot, on behalf of the Government, intervene in that particular discussion here in the D&aacute;il Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The discussion proposed for the Topical Issues matter is the role of local authorities in the delivery of climate action.  Local authorities will continue to play an increasingly important role in meeting our climate obligations.  In 2018 the Department established four climate action regional offices, CAROs, around the country to drive climate action at a local level. These CAROs have already played a key role in supporting the national climate policy, through co-ordinating the development of local adaptation strategies, through developing the role of the local authority sector in supporting the implementation of climate mitigation policy, as well as through community engagement and contributing to the national dialogue on climate action. <\/p>  <p>  Climate action is a relatively new challenge for the local authority sector and will require new skill sets and capacities to be developed within each local authority over time.  In recognition of this, the Department is funding a local authority climate action training programme.  More than 9,000 local authority staff received training in 2021 under this programme.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 enshrines the national climate objective to pursue and achieve, by no later than 2050, the transition to a climate-resilient and biodiversity-rich, environmentally sustainable and climate-neutral economy.<\/p>  <p>  Section 16 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 sets out the provisions governing the establishment and operation of local authority climate action plans and requires that \"Each local authority shall prepare and make a plan relating to a period of five years (... referred to as a &lsquo;local authority climate action plan&rsquo;) which shall specify the mitigation and the adaptation measures to be adopted by the local authority.\"  The first such plan is to be developed within 12 months of the receipt of a request from the Minister, which request shall be made not later than 18 months after the coming into operation of the Act, and in the case of each subsequent plan, not less than once in every period of five years.<\/p>  <p>  The local authority climate action plans will be progressed in three phases: phase 1 is to establish the evidence base and the delivery of the national Climate Action Plan 2021; phase 2 is the development of the local authority climate action plans; and phase 3 is the implementation of the local authority climate action plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 identified nearly 90 actions with dedicated time frames for delivery and reporting in 2021 for which local authorities have direct responsibility or are key stakeholders in their delivery.  These actions are currently being developed through local authorities and will be reported on through the monitoring of the Climate Action Plan 2021.  Each local authority will be responsible for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from across its own assets and infrastructure, while also taking on a broader role of influencing and facilitating others to meet their own targets. They are entrusted to work through their regulatory and strategic functions to operationalise the ambitious national climate targets and policy at local levels, to help in the delivery of the national climate objective.<\/p>  <p>  The local authority climate action plan is a key instrument that will strengthen the links between national and international climate policy and the delivery of effective climate action at local and community levels.  This will be an important measure to ensure the environmental, social and economic benefits that come with climate action are fully realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600006#D00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1645004520,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments on the climate action regional offices.

Yet, in Galway, we see local elected representatives actively campaigning against national policy and actively campaigning against their own party policies, as well as an executive that is unwilling to ensure that they meet their responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2020, the programme for Government allocated &euro;360 million to active travel, which is a ring-fenced fund.  How many kilometres and how much of a cycling network has been built by Galway City Council?  The answer is \"Nothing\".  The council, which for decades extolled the virtues of a ring road to alleviate congestion, was given funds to develop a proven solution to congestion but did nothing.<\/p>  <p>  Our local government structures have been undermined for years, with a highly centralised power structure.  The forthcoming directly elected mayor for Limerick will be a welcome step, as is the upcoming citizens' assembly to consider a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  In the face of the reluctance of local authorities to truly embrace our national ambition for climate action, we all, as Members of the Oireachtas, are faced with a huge communications and community engagement challenge.  We need to communicate not only our ambition but also what our targets mean and the timelines in which we need to achieve them.

I think people are pretty happy with that, despite it having been a difficult decision.<\/p>  <p>  The development and implementation of local authority climate action plans are a statutory requirement and a fundamental mechanism to enable Ireland to deliver climate actions.  Local authorities are already well positioned at the forefront of climate action in Ireland and currently play a significant role in delivering adaptation and mitigation measures at local and community levels.  The phased approach taken to their development and implementation will ensure that local authorities are well placed to deliver on the actions within the climate action plan 2021, while also preparing their own actions plans.<\/p>  <p>  The four climate action regional offices were established in 2018 and will play a key role across the whole local government sector.  Local government, in this way, will act as a fundamental link between national policy and engaging communities and individuals across Ireland in tailoring solutions to their area, to realise our ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in a fair and equitable manner.

I am concerned about the stand-alone sewage treatment facilities that were built right across the entire country back between 2000 to 2008.<\/p> <p>Companies then ended up in NAMA and no one seems to have taken responsibility for the management of these sewage treatment facilities.  It came to a head in the past two weeks in Castlewhite, Whitechurch, County Cork.  Forty houses have access to a sewage treatment facility in which the sewers get totally blocked up.  The local authority says it has no responsibility to deal with it but Cork County Council took action and came out to resolve the problems.  I have been liaising with that council since then.  Technically, the council is not in charge of the scheme.  Irish Water says it is not prepared to take it in charge.  We have been left with a dilemma as a result.<\/p> <p> My understanding is that there are well over 400 such facilities across the country.  Ongoing work needs to be done on them.  They are not up to standard and we have no policy in place in respect of them.  I was sent alarming photographs in the past week showing raw sewage outside and very close to the facility I refer to, which may well contaminate local streams, etc.  I ask that the matter be given priority and that a mechanism be put in place between Irish Water and the local authorities in order to ensure that there will be a proper management.<\/p> <p> The other interesting point I do not understand concerns the new houses being built in the area.  They seem to be using this treatment facility.  How is this happening when no one seems to be in charge of management or maintenance?  This is one example.  In County Cork alone, there are more than 20 facilities affected by this dilemma.  No organisation is in charge, there are no management companies in place and there are serious threats to the local environment as a result.

I will outline the response from the Department, but I say at the outset that the conditions the Deputy describes are unacceptable.  I have seen other parts of the country where this has been the case.  It is a practice which should not have taken place but did.  Such cases need to be resolved as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  The position on resolving wastewater treatment facilities built by developers to service housing estates and estates that have not been taken in charge by the local authority is as follows.  Residential estates normally receive their water services &ndash; that is disposal of wastewater and supply of drinking water &ndash; from the Irish Water network.  These estates are subsequently taken in charge in the normal way by the planning authority, and Irish Water takes responsibility for the water services in these estates.  A small subset of estates are not taken in charge and do not have their water services networks connected to the Irish Water network and instead rely on water services infrastructure provided by the developer.  This infrastructure provided by the developer of the estate is also called stand-alone developer-provided infrastructure, DPI.  They are privately owned facilities.  Much of this developer-provided infrastructure, consisting of small stand-alone wastewater treatment plants which were put in place in the 1990s and early 2000s, is now at the end of or past its useful working life.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department introduced the multi-annual developer-provided water services infrastructure resolution programme to provide funding for the progressive resolution of housing estates with legacy DPI issues.  All DPI estates, regardless of their origins, including those in NAMA, were eligible for consideration.  The focus of this first programme is on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the Irish Water network.  This will enable Irish Water to take responsibility for the ongoing operation and management of the water service in the estate, once the estate is taken in charge by the planning authority.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 September 2020, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, announced allocations of just over &euro;3.36 million for 26 estates across ten counties with almost 950 households to benefit under the new programme, to enable the taking in charge of these estates.  This announcement was the first tranche of funding in projects for investment under the new programme.  Further investment will follow over a number of funding cycles to fully resolve DPI estates.  The programme will also support a number of pilot projects where connection to the Irish Water network is not feasible in the immediate future.  These pilot projects, together with a major study being undertaken by Irish Water that is due for completion in quarter 2 of 2022, will inform future policy considerations on resolving substandard developer-provided infrastructure with sustainable solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Under the approvals announced by the Minister in September 2020, local authorities were asked to consider further estates requiring funding for resolution within their functional area.  Arising from this process, valid bids for estates were received from a number of local authorities.  My Department is awaiting a report from the expert panel tasked with evaluating the bids.  The Minister expects a report from the panel in the coming weeks and a decision on funding will quickly follow.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the issues highlighted by the Deputy.  They are unsafe for communities and need to be resolved as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600007#E00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1645005120,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  My understanding is that there is now a connection from this treatment plant directly into a pumping station that pumps sewage into a facility for Irish Water, in towards Cork city.  That connection is with an Irish Water sewage treatment facility but no one seems to be taking responsibility for the individual treatment facility that is servicing Castlewhite in Whitechurch.<\/p>  <p>  There is the added problem that no local authority will take estates in charge where Irish Water has not taken the sewage treatment facilities in charge.  There are cases of developments whose builders have gone into NAMA and there is no management company in place.  These are housing estates, not apartment blocks.  There is no one responsible for the management of sewage treatment.  If there is any other problem in the estate, whether roads, footpaths or any issue, no one is taking it on board.  When people purchased these houses, the builder paid money to the local authority in charges.  There were also bonds in place and my understanding is many of the bonds in respect of these estates were never drawn down because something was not completed.  That is an issue because the banks or people who provided the bonds to the builders are saying they have no legal duty to the local authority and, therefore, will not pay up on them.  The receivers are not taking action either.<\/p>  <p>  Those issues are still overhanging from 2008 and we need to bring a resolution in respect of estates which do not have a proper management structure for sewage treatment and there is nothing in the pipeline in relation to their being taken in charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600007#E00300","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1645005120,"counter":33,"content":"<p>On the issue the Deputy mentioned in Castlewhite, if there is a connection to a pumping station that is an Irish Water facility, we will look into it with Irish Water.

We will look into that.<\/p>  <p>  On bonds and the process of taking in charge, local authorities need to work proactively with Irish Water and any other relevant party on the outstanding wastewater infrastructural issues and the wider issues around the process of taking in charge to try to resolve those for residents and communities.

It is important to note that at the outset.<\/p><p>The important thing about this motion is to highlight the total disregard that successive Governments have had for people with disabilities and those who have been left without supports for transport.  Ireland is a signatory of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which places an onus on the signatories to provide access to transportation on an equal basis to enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life.  People with disabilities should be able to lead full and active lives in our communities.  They need access to public and personal transport.  Many people with disabilities are confined to a home, unable to engage on an equal basis in employment or their community.  They are unable to access Government support to help them with their personal transport needs.<\/p><p>It is important to reference the report of the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, Grounded: Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes, which he published in November.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMany people with disabilities are stuck at home unable to engage on an equal basis in employment or in their community as they can&rsquo;t access government support to help with their personal transport needs.  This social isolation casts a shadow on us as a country and on our commitment to equality and social inclusion for all. <\/blockquote>  <p>We are asking the Government to: provide funding to finalise and introduce a comprehensive transport support scheme to replace the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant scheme as a matter of urgent policy; reinstate and amend the primary medical certificate process which presently is not fit for purpose; address the issues relating to the eligibility criteria for the schemes with immediate effect; improve access to public transport for people with disabilities; and invest in transport infrastructure that considers and supports accessibility, mobility, and inclusion for people with a disability.<\/p><p>In his report, Peter Tyndall cited a number of case studies.  I will read one of them.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDavid has restricted movement and severe nerve damage on one side of his body.  He also has special insoles for his shoes, and heel supports.  He is significantly incapacitated from the pain.  David has a Disabled Drivers Parking Permit.  He said that an adapted car would help his mental health and mobility but he has been refused the Primary Medical Certificate. <\/blockquote>  <p>The primary medical certificate is a key component in the life of people with disabilities, considering the fact that the Indecon report stated that the cost of living with a disability is between &euro;9,000 and &euro;12,000 per individual on top of their ordinary living costs.  It is important that we look at this issue in a really humane way.  The fact that successive governments have not addressed this issue is a shadow on politics.  It is important that we get it right, and that we get it right now.  There are people who are grounded, as Peter Tyndall has indicated.  They cannot access their communities or go to work.  We talk a great deal about employability for people with disabilities.  Unfortunately, if they cannot leave their house, it is a very poor start.  As the Minister of State is aware and as I stated last week, in a rural constituency like Galway East, public transport is not available for everybody.  It is available in town centres and the services run from town to town.  The answer that Government has been giving is that it will provide accessible public transport.  I do not believe we can wait that long to help these people.  We must act now.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, I implore the Minister of State to engage with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to get this project going again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600008#F00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1645005720,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I wish to thank my colleagues for bringing this motion forward and I thank our administrator, Ms C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, for the excellent research she did on this it.  There is an urgent need for improvements to the benefits available to people with disabilities who are holders of primary medical certificates under the disabled persons and disabled passengers scheme.  Primary medical certificates are issued to people who have a severe and permanent disability which generally restricts their movements.  Most need a wheelchair to get around.  Up to now, holders of such certificates could qualify for an exemption from VAT and vehicle registration tax, VRT, when buying cars that are accessible or adaptable for wheelchair use.  These exemptions have substantially reduced the ultimate cost to the buyer, who is typically a wheelchair user or a carer of a wheelchair user, including parents of children with serious disabilities.  These are people who already have to cope with huge expenses associated with a disability.  Most adapted vehicles are equipped with a ramp that enables a wheelchair or a mobile scooter to get into the car.  The floor of the vehicle may have been lowered to allow significant head height.<\/p>  <p>  There is a crisis looming for these people, however, because the manufacturers who make the cars that are wheelchair adaptable are switching over to making only electric vehicles.  This is a problem that is looming large now, not just something that is going to arise as we approach 2030, the year by which sales of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned.  While electric vehicles up to a certain value are exempt from VRT, they are way more expensive than the diesel or petrol models that have been used by these families and individuals up to now.  We are talking about an increased cost of perhaps &euro;10,000 to &euro;20,000 that they will face just to make it possible to do basic things like get to work, go to the shops, bring a child to school or to attend medical appointments.  Earlier this month, the Minister for Transport announced a &euro;15 million scheme that will offer taxi drivers up to &euro;25,000 to switch to electric vehicles, including a grant to make them wheelchair-accessible.  That is something that taxi drivers will no doubt be very happy with, helping them to make what would otherwise be an expensive transition to electric-powered vehicles.  The families and individuals that I am talking about need to be helped in exactly the same way.  That is why I am urging the Government to offer holders of primary medical certificates the same kind of financial assistance as the taxi drivers.  As I mentioned earlier, they already face mounting expenses that people without a disability do not incur.  Most people simply could not afford to pay the huge jump in costs involved in buying an electric car.  In light of this and in addition to being exempt from VAT, they should also be given a financial grant that would bridge the difference between the cost of buying a wheelchair-adaptable diesel or petrol car and the new increased cost of buying an electric car.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government published by the coalition parties in June 2020 contains a commitment to making a difference that will make things better for people with a disability in this country.  It stressed the need to improve the services available and promised to empower and give those with a disability the ability to choose the supports that most meet their needs.  One of the most basic needs of a person with a disability, or their carers, is the ability to access transport that is suitable to their needs and which enables them to live their best life.  To do that, in the years to come they must be given additional financial assistance that will enable them to continue to buy the wheelchair-accessible vehicles that they absolutely need.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Government for accepting our motion.

As has already been stated, those in households that are in the challenging position of requiring transport methods that need to be adopted for disability purposes spend, on average, &euro;9,027 on items relating to that disability.  These items include, but are not limited to, disability-specific items and unique versions of products specially adopted for use by people with disability challenges, particularly in respect of specially adapted motor vehicles.<\/p> <p>The bottom line is that, unfortunately, transport costs tend to be just an additional cost of living that people with disabilities simply cannot afford.  This situation is only getting worse now as all other daily living costs, like light and heat and power, are getting more expensive almost weekly.<\/p> <p> My view is that everyone, including those with disabilities, should be given the opportunity to lead full and active lives in their communities.  Clearly, people with disabilities need to have access to affordable public and personal transport in order to lead fully inclusive lives.  It is also clear that most people with disability challenges are unable to access Government supports for their personal transport needs.  When they are unable to access these supports, it is unfortunately the case that many become confined to their homes and, as a result, are unable to engage equally in employment or get involved in their community in ways they would like.  This is wrong and must be addressed.  The Government must step up and offer the support and assistance that are badly needed.<\/p> <p> This is why the Regional Group is calling on the Government to take the following actions: provide the necessary funding to urgently finalise and introduce a comprehensive transport support scheme to replace the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant; reinstate and amend the primary medical certificate process, which is not fit for purpose; address issues concerning eligibility criteria for the schemes with immediate effect; and improve access to public transport for people with disabilities and invest in transport infrastructure that considers and supports accessibility, mobility and inclusion for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> We are also calling on the Government to take immediate action because of several issues.  These include the fact that the disabled drivers and disabled passenger schemes continues to reinforce the inequitable eligibility criteria in primary legislation and excluding many people in need of access to supports for personal transport.  On this point, I have dealt with constituents in Louth who have attempted to apply to these schemes.  The bottom line is that it is nearly impossible to get approval.  There is no consistency in the approach taken.  Since the discontinuation of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant for new applicants in 2013, the Government has yet to introduce a fair and equal replacement scheme.  This is wrong and must be addressed immediately.<\/p> <p> The recent report by the Ombudsman, Grounded: Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes, highlights the years of inaction on the part of the Government in failing to address supports for people with disabilities.  In tabling this motion, the Regional Group is seeking to highlight many issues faced by people with disabilities when it comes to transport.  It should also be noted that Ireland, as a signatory to the UNCRPD has a responsibility to provide equal access to transportation to enable persons with disabilities to live independently and to participate fully in all aspects of life.  As a society, we must ensure that all people with disabilities should be able to lead full and active lives within our communities and that they also have full access to public and personal transport.  We cannot have a situation whereby people with disabilities are confined to their homes and unable to engage equally in employment or in their community because they are unable to access Government supports to assist with their personal transport needs.<\/p> <p> Once more, I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for their help and assistance with bringing this motion to the House.  I ask all Deputies to support this motion and to recognise that there are, unfortunately, people with disabilities who are being confined to their homes simply because they are unable to access Government supports.  In this day and age, this is wrong.  In fact, it is morally wrong.  People with disabilities should be able to live full and active lives, and if that means having to access Government support to enjoy an active life, then we must ensure there are no barriers excluding them from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600008#F00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645006320,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an nGr&uacute;pa R&eacute;igi&uacute;nach agus C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh as an obair a chuaigh isteach sa r&uacute;n seo.

I am grateful to the Regional Group for tabling this strong motion.  I am also grateful that this subject is being debated by all parties here because this concerns an important aspect of inclusion.  Ireland today wears the clothes of inclusion.  Indeed, it flies the flag of inclusion.  The reality for many people throughout the country, however, is radically different than the superficial clothes worn.  Sadly, phenomenal barriers remain in contemporary Ireland which prevent people from being included and engaged in society.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in recent months I have seen several schools where children with certain disabilities have not been not allowed to attend for full days because of those disabilities.  I know of people with disabilities who have been on social housing waiting lists for more than a decade in certain counties.  The level of homelessness among people with disabilities is higher than in the general population.  During the Covid-19 restrictions, we have seen a serious impact on the education and development of people with disabilities.  Some 74% of childcare providers have confessed to seeing regression in children with special needs and disabilities.  Even in a special needs school in my constituency, I have seen where the lack of investment has left a situation where there are rats and holes in the walls.  That is the case after that school has been trying to get funding for years.<\/p>  <p>  We have an unequal society and one with barriers.  For all the inclusion colours we proclaim, sections of our society are significantly excluded.  I worked on making vehicles accessible for people with disabilities for many years.  It was one of my first jobs when I came out of college.  I worked with hundreds of people with disabilities to get them private transportation to enable them to drive themselves or be driven by their families.  I have seen at first-hand the radical difference such provision makes in people's lives.  It is important to say that these are people with great skills, knowledge and abilities in many ways and, potentially, with great contributions to make to society.  It is important to say that our society is far poorer for not being able to allow the full integration of these people.  I have also seen a barrier in situations where this transportation ability is taken from families.  I have witnessed the impact that has on the people with the disabilities and on their families, in respect of not being able to grow in levels of skills and confidence and engagement.  Therefore, there is a major impact if we do not ensure that people simply have the human right to travel around society.<\/p>  <p>  This is the area where the frustration exists.  We had a system before austerity where people could apply for funding to ensure they had access to transportation.  The current system is one that was reduced and it is not fit for purpose.  The average household in this situation spends about &euro;9,027 on items explicitly concerning disability.  This is a phenomenal expense in respect of just surviving, existing and living for many families.  Transport costs especially are a significant and recurring cost for these households.  If we do not provide a guarantee of funding for families to ensure they can access transportation properly, then we are, effectively, excluding people from society.  The knock-on effects of that are great on personal growth and development and on the general ability of people to be able to live a full life in a republic.<\/p>  <p>  That is what we are after all.  We are a republic, where everybody should be equal and should be equally able to reach their full potential and participate in society as much as possible.  I call on the Government to go back to the drawing board in respect of ensuring that the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant schemes, which were sealed off previously, are reopened to new entrants in future.  There should be a direct funding stream for families to enable them to travel to locations providing vehicles accessible to people with disabilities to allow them to start living their lives again and fully engage in society.  They should be able to do that in a manner which does not penalise them through the costs incurred.<\/p>  <p>  I know many young people with disabilities, and they become so reliant on their parents to bring them everywhere.<\/p> <p>That hampers their development of independence and their ability to grow as individual, independent human beings.  We should be able to guarantee every individual in society the ability to engage completely independently.  I urge the Government to get to grips with this issue, because we cannot allow it to persist further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600009#G00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645006920,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Today&rsquo;s motion relates to the important issue of improving transport options for people with disabilities.  I thank the Regional Group for giving me the platform to speak about what is going on in my Department with regard to this matter.  We have to recognise that there are transport challenges for people with disabilities, which I and my Government colleagues are addressing.  I acknowledge the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recent report from November 2021 and the resignation of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal in January, which clearly indicate that we have work to do in relation to the provision of adequate transport supports for people with disabilities.  The Government recognises the need to develop support structures that are open, accessible and that meet the complex and varied needs of people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  There is a complexity to the issues involved that requires a considered response, especially given the diversity of the needs of people with disabilities.  We must clearly identify the gaps and avoid jumping into hasty solutions which may not be sustainable or adequate in the long term.  We must instead ensure that we are creating properly tailored and properly targeted supports.  The Government&rsquo;s national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, contains clear commitments and actions related to accessible transport options and mobility supports for people with disabilities.  Successful delivery of the NDIS is a priority for me and for the Government, including  in the context of our commitments to review and take action on transport supports.<\/p>  <p>  The motion raises a number of critical issues.  We are addressing these  through the NDIS, which I chair, and specifically through the transport working group, which I also chair.  Although it is not in the script, it is important for me to say that I am a rural Deputy.  I understand this.  Many constituents come to me regularly about it.  I knew about it long before I became a Deputy or a Minister of State.  This has been a priority for me since I first came into office.  I asked about transport and the Department told me that the Department of Health does not look after transport.  I pulled out the HSE open routes model.  In the last weeks, I have managed to reconfigure the transport committee, and I am chairing it.<\/p>  <p>  The transport working group is focused on achieving action 104 of the NDIS, which commits us to leading a review of transport supports and to develop proposals for a co-ordinated plan for such provision.  This plan is to make the most efficient use of available transport resources.  The working group met last month on 26 January.  Following engagement last year between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, it was decided to use the transport working group to assist in the review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  People who sit on that group include stakeholders and people from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection, Health, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Transport.  All the key stakeholders are sitting at the table.  This is the first time in a number of years where we have gone back around the table and put transport at the centre of the table to find the solutions that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n talks about.  They are a priority.<\/p>  <p>  One of the topics discussed at that meeting was the need to take stock of the current and past provision of transport supports in order to make an informed decision on what future action is required.  In that regard, I asked Department representatives to present on the transport support schemes that they are responsible for, and I heard views and concerns from the stakeholders present.  It was an informative discussion with diverse views.  It is clear that a variety of measures and supports exist across Government and that we must make sure that action is co-ordinated across the system and addresses real needs.  There is no point in the Department of Finance saying one thing and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth coming up with something else which is not funded.  We need to establish the solutions to address the matters raised in the motion this morning.  Most importantly, as the UNCRPD requires, disability stakeholders form part of this group and the contribution of members of the NDIS disability stakeholder group and the wider disability stakeholders present in January has been extremely valuable.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the motion identifies the mobility allowance, the motorised transport grant, and the primary medical certificate process, which it states need to be reviewed.  As the Deputies know, these schemes are being reviewed by the Departments responsible.  An opportunity like this has been somewhat underutilised by the Deputies as it offers no suggestions beyond reviewing the current schemes.  There are no new suggestions.  The opportunity for innovation by the Deputies in how we approach these transport supports has been missed.  We are all aware of the importance and benefit of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, which is run by the Department of Finance.  I am also aware of the criticism expressed about access to the scheme and the entry criteria for primary medical certificates.  We all know that the entry criteria are out of date.  For example, people who are blind, have Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis cannot access it.  Once people show any form of mobility at all, they cannot access the scheme.  We all know that it is not fit for purpose and needs to be reviewed in its entirety to address the matters of inclusion and participation in education and work.  Action 104 just talks about opportunities to participate in employment.  There is more to life than just work.  That is a huge part of it, but there is also the matter of getting to education and being able to socialise.  Whether people are living in Portumna or in Dublin 6, they should have the same opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is aware of these issues and committed to a comprehensive review of the scheme.  The transport working group will play a strong role in supporting the Department of Finance in this and in ensuring that the next steps make sense across the system.  Historically, two additional schemes, the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant, were operated by the HSE at a time when there was limited availability of accessible public transport options.  The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013 on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both schemes in the context of the Equal Status Act.  I am leading work looking at how these schemes can be redeveloped to ensure people are supported adequately.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to set out the range of work currently in train to improve access to transport.  We have ongoing work on accessible public transport being led by the Minister for Transport, in partnership with the National Transport Authority, some of which is focused specifically on rural challenges.  We have the disability entitlement to the free travel scheme, administered by the Minister for Social Protection, the criteria for which were recently reviewed to be more open.  We have Cl&aacute;r funding from the Minister for Rural and Community Development, delivering transport supports for rural areas.  The task that Government has set itself over the coming months is to identify where needs are not being addressed and to see how to respond to these needs.  That is my focus in leading the transport working group and that is the programme of work that lies before us.<\/p>  <p>  I will call on all Departments and agencies with a role in this area to participate in that review and to help us assemble the evidence base we need to make informed choices.  Through this working group, we have a real opportunity to deliver schemes fit for purpose in today&rsquo;s world.  That is why the Government is not opposing this motion, but also why I am saying that we need the time to formulate the right suite of measures.  We know that there are transport challenges for people with disabilities in this country.  In my role as Minister of State, I am determined to work actively to address those challenges, conscious of the importance of ensuring that people with disabilities get the opportunity to participate fully in society.<\/p>  <p>  I referred to the HSE open routes model.  We have seen that successfully used in Kerry and Leitrim.  Bernard O'Regan from the HSE is leading that.  I also looked at the group called Accessible Community Transport Southside, ACTS, based in Dublin.  I am sure that Deputy Ward would be aware of it.  It covers community healthcare organisations, CHOs, 6, 7 and 9.  Depending on one's CHO, there may be no barriers.  We need to take the lesson from this group, based on Dublin's southside.  That is a model for integration.  When people wish to go out on a Friday or Saturday evening to have a pint or go to the cinema, they can book this service.<\/p> <p>At the moment, it is not adequately funded.  I will hold my hands up and say that.  More investment is needed.  That is a model of rural link in an urban setting that we need to consider in terms of how to create that level of engagement.  Gone are the days when we need a bus just for day services.  We need to have buses to ensure that people can participate equally in society, day or night.  I am very conscious of the massive impact of not having access to transport.  On what the Ombudsman said, people are grounded.  I am trying to unlock that to ensure that people can participate equally at all levels.  I again thank the Deputies for bringing forward this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600010#H00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645007520,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her detailed opening statement.  I am again grateful for the opportunity to speak on the topic of disability in the Chamber.  People from that group are physically under-represented in Leinster House.  It is important that they are not under-represented from an advocacy point of view.  That is why I am delighted to be here with my Regional Group colleagues to do our bit in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We all appreciate that disability matters are broad and multifaceted and, at times, can be quite complex.  The beauty of the motion before the House is that it focuses on one particular facet, namely, transport.  That said, transport is not just about wheels or moving from A to B.  Rather, it is a fundamental enabler and allows people to have the independence and autonomy they need to go about their daily lives and make a meaningful contribution to society, whether that is socially or from an employment point of view.<\/p>  <p>  The motion will not change the world, but it can completely transform the lives of many people.  It is exactly what we should be doing in our Parliament, namely, making minor adjustments which will have significant positive impact outside of the parliamentary precinct.  That is why I am very glad to be here today.  I very much welcome the acceptance of the motion by the Government, which makes perfect sense to me.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referenced the Ombudsman's report from November of last year, which is an excellent report and just 24 pages long.  Mr. Peter Tyndall is a straight shooter and calls it as he sees it.  He identified three major areas for improvement.  In fairness, there are criticisms in the report but there are also observations.  Mr. Tyndall offers some practical solutions.<\/p>  <p>  The issues he identified are public transport, issues with personal transport and access to the primary medical certificate, which is very important.  I come from a commuter constituency, Kildare South, and totally identify with what he said about public transport issues.  Some of the comments in the report state that people with disabilities find it difficult to get on trains, many elevators were broken and that there was no access to toilets, as well as a litany of other indignities they had to face on a daily basis, which is completely unnecessary.  I accept and welcome the Government's commitment to public transport.  <\/p>  <p>  Much funding is currently being pumped into public transport in terms of green energy, hydrogen buses, new trains, etc.  However, we should not forget the basics.  We can talk about the sexy, glamorous and cool stuff, but we need to remember the basics.  The basics include ensuring every person in society have equal access to public transport.  They should be able to alight safely from a train, bus or whatever.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue relates to personal transport, which is something we can focus on between now and the budget.  We do not require any planning permission or tradespeople to build a new platform.  We just need to give people access to the appropriate funding they need.  The budget in October is a good way to do that because people with disabilities do not need a whole lot.  They just need access to funds because the cost of living is, quite rightly, a very topical issue at the moment for able-bodied people.  It is even more important for disabled people because they incur greater expenses.  On the income side, they are more likely to be employed at a lower salary, if they are gainfully employed at all.  They face a double whammy on both sides.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept what my colleagues said about 2013 when the mobility allowance was closed to new entrants.  The same happened with the motorised transport grant.  I echo the call for a more comprehensive transport support scheme, which is important.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding eligibility criteria for the primary medical certificates, because the two schemes I mentioned have been cancelled tax rebates and reliefs are even more important.  The Minister of State said we should put forward some constructive views and I am very happy to do so.  The primary medical certificate, of which I have some experience, is medicalised box ticking.  We need to replace that with an overarching mobility point of view.  We would have much better results and access if a more general perspective was taken.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very grateful that the Government has accepted the motion.  The Regional Group will not be found wanting in any support it can provide from a budgeting or resource point of view.  I do not think the disabled community are looking for anything in particular.  They are not looking for preferential treatment or special treatment; rather, they are just looking for a fair deal.  We should be prepared to give them exactly that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600011#J00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1645007520,"counter":44,"content":"<p>According to the last census, there are 650,000 people in Ireland with some form of disability.  In Ireland, under the Disability Act the term disability is defined as \"a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of ... impairment\".  Denying or making it difficult for a person with a disability to access transport with ease, whether personal or public transport, increases the restrictions already placed on that person by his or her personal circumstances.  By failing to ensure that suitable means of transport are provided to meet the needs of disabled people we are depriving them of the right to live their best lives.  We are subjecting them to a life that able-bodied people would not tolerate.<\/p>  <p>  Under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, the key aim was to ensure that people with disabilities who are able and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  Much has been written and spoken about equality in the workplace.  However, very little has been said about how disabled people face innumerable challenges in getting to and from their place of work.  This is just one of the many hidden discriminations that disabled people face.  <\/p>  <p>  An able-bodied person is seldom, if ever, asked how he or she will navigate a work journey during a job interview.  Therefore, it may be deemed inappropriate to ask a disabled person the same question.  Yet, that could be the issue that is on the mind of an employer.  It could be that an employer is concerned that a disabled person may be absent from work due to transport circumstances beyond his or her control.  <\/p>  <p>  Disabled people who rely on public transport faced countless issues.  The first and most obvious is that in Tipperary and across rural Ireland there are limited public transport options available.  I am aware of wheelchair users who need to be physically lifted onto buses and trains while their chair is stored away.  This could be their dilemma twice a day, which is, in effect, a double assault on their dignity.<\/p>  <p>  While some transport companies have introduced qualification to a number of their vehicles, they argue that the costs are prohibitive and that the changes would only benefit a small number of people.  Therefore, a small number of people are cast aside.  This is not the only problem faced by disabled people who rely on public transport.  Information signs and timetables, if they exist, are usually above the line of vision of a wheelchair user.  There is zero access to audio, video or Braille information.  Again, a number of people are cast aside.  <\/p>  <p>  Disabled people who rely solely on public transport may envy those who drive themselves.  A converted car obtained through the mobility grant scheme can be a lifeline and provide a person with independence and greater freedom of movement.  Aside from the issues most people are aware of, such as limited parking availability, one of the more recent obstacles facing disabled motorists is electric vehicle charging accessibility, something that has been completely overlooked.  At the current time, there are just four wheelchair accessible ESB electrical chargers in this country.  The aim is to have a total of 50 multi electric charging sites in place by 2023.  That is 50 places overall in Ireland where more than 600,000 disabled people will be able to charge their cars.  Yet again, a small number of people are being cast aside.  A lack of Government support should not be among the list of reasons disabled people in this country are disadvantaged.  Funding is required now to finalise and swiftly introduce a comprehensive and inclusive transport scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the primary medical certificate needs to be updated and amended as a matter of urgency.  <\/p> <p>The application of the primary medical certificate is a disgraceful shambles.  Through my constituency office in Tipperary I am aware of several people being disallowed access to the scheme.  This is appalling treatment of people in genuine need.  The rules governing the scheme are outrageously stringent.  The current scheme appears to be designed deliberately to reduce the number of successful applications.  This question of restricted eligibility, and the obvious curtailment, led to the resignation of the disabled drivers appeals board.<\/p> <p> Public transport, by virtue of its name, must be user-friendly for all users.  Only then will all people included and none will be left feeling cast aside.  I welcome that the Government is not opposing the motion and is accepting its tenor.  It is vital the Government follows this with positive action and tangible improvements.  The time for talking and speaking about empathy has long passed and it is now time for immediate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600011#J00300","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645008120,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I commend the Regional Group on raising this important matter, taking in the primary medical certificates and the lack of personalised transport supports for people with disabilities.  It is something that is discussed regularly at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters meetings, and it is also raised at practically every meeting I attend with disabled people or their representatives organisations.  People with disabilities should be able to live full and active lives within their communities but many obstacles remain that work to prevent them doing so, and access to personal transport is one of them.<\/p>  <p>  Improving access to public transport is important in its own right, but it is unreasonable to suggest it can address the transport needs of many disabled people who may live in rural areas or struggle to get to bus stops or stations.  Many disabled people have told me it is impossible to get a wheelchair-accessible taxi when they order one as the HSE seems to have contracted many of them for its own use.  I am interested in the scheme referenced by the Minister of State in the CHO areas in Dublin and that is something that could be rolled out to other areas as well.  Without access to personal transport, many disabled people cannot do what others take for granted, including working, visiting family and friends, shopping or any other aspect of life where mobility is essential.<\/p>  <p>  In a report before Christmas entitled Grounded - Unequal Access for People with Disabilities to Personal Transport Schemes, the Ombudsman focused attention on the fact that personal transport supports for people with disabilities are inadequate, unfair and inequitable.  The report points out that in 2013 the Government decided to discontinue both the mobility allowance and the motorised grant to new applicants.  At that time, it was said that an alternative scheme would be drawn up but we are nine years on and no alternative has been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The report also indicates that the remaining supports available for people living with a disability comprise the disabled driver and disabled passenger scheme, which provides a range of tax reliefs linked to the purchase and use of specially constructed or adapted vehicles by drivers and passengers with a disability.  However, it goes on to highlight that the scheme is inadequate to meet the needs of many people living with a disability as the limited medical criteria for eligibility are excessively restrictive.  Moreover, a recommendation that the Department of Finance would introduce legislation to replace the existing medical criteria with an overall assessment of general mobility was never acted on.  It is shameful that in 2022 disabled people are still not able to participate equally and actively in their community and work.<\/p>  <p>  It recently emerged that the entire appeals board of the scheme resigned after expressing concern about how the scheme was being handled and amid ongoing concerns it is too difficult to obtain a primary medical certificate.  I am not surprised.  In looking at the figures, from 401 appeals assessed in 2017, only 12 were successful.  In 2018, there were 20 successful appeals from 386 and in 2019, there were nine successful appeals from 424.  In 2020 there were four successful appeals from 116, and that was the year the scheme was suspended for much of the year.<\/p>  <p>  These matters have been raised repeatedly with the Government and the Minister for Finance is totally failing in demonstrating leadership here.  The people with disabilities are paying the price.  Many disabled people are effectively being denied the ability to travel due to the stringent criteria for obtaining a primary medical certificate.  This is denying disabled people their rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, to live fully independent lives.  This can have a major impact on personal lives if people are unable or less able to live independently, socialise and work without these vital supports.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 18 months we have seen a litany of failure in how the scheme has been handled by the Department of Finance and this must change.  There was a Supreme Court ruling in June 2020 that overturned the board's decision to deny two families a primary medical certificate.  This ruling led to the suspension of the scheme, which was reopened in January 2021 after an amendment in a finance Bill.  This was supposed to be an interim measure and a review of the scheme was promised by the Minister for Finance in January 2021, to be carried out within the year.  It was never delivered and in recent media comments, the Department of Finance confirmed it had not carried out the review committed to by the Minister.  We are now 20 months after that Supreme Court ruling.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, should answer questions about his total failure in how this scheme is being handled.  There is a direct breach of the provisions of the UNCRPD, which this country ratified in 2018 but is some way off implementing.  I do not feel there is any sense of urgency in addressing the matter of personal transport options for the affected people.  The transport working group established two years ago seems to have done very little as part of the national disability inclusion strategy.  Perhaps it is another victim of Covid-19 but maybe that is another excuse to delay the process.  An immediate review of these schemes is required, with input from disabled persons or organisations and other relevant stakeholders.  It must include detailed actions to widen eligibility to the scheme and improve administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600012#K00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1645008120,"counter":47,"content":"<p>At the end of the Minister of State's contribution, she mentioned people with multiple sclerosis, MS, who would not be able to access the primary medical certificate because they have some form of mobility.

Backlogs in processing the primary medical certificates have created further delays, although the Minister of State has indicated a change is imminent in that regard.

A lack of opportunity to use transport can be devastating for a person's ability to work, socialise, complete everyday tasks and enable them to live full and independent lives.

It is really extraordinary that a board resigned because of how its members felt this process was being neglected.  I appreciate what the Minister of State has said but these people took this action in the first place because they clearly felt so frustrated by the lack of progress being made and how the issue was being neglected by the Government.  They did not do it for the sake of publicity because it only came to light afterwards, so they clearly felt the matter was not being progressed or taken seriously.  I hope this can be resolved.  The Minister of State indicates the board will be reappointed and I look forward to seeing that.  There are so many other issues that nevertheless remain to be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The first of these is how stringent are the criteria for the scheme.  This has been well articulated, including by Deputy Ward, who spoke about those affected by multiple sclerosis.  Fibromyalgia is another condition affecting the people in question.  I recently spoke to the Minister for Health about a constituent of mine who was diagnosed with clear cell sarcoma.<\/p> <p>She needs to adapt her car to maintain her independence, but she does not qualify for the primary medical certificate because she only has one arm amputated rather than both arms.  That is absurd and disgusting.  People in that situation face other challenges as well.  The cost of prosthetics is not covered by the State.  However, it is unacceptable that it is so stringent and that people who have serious impediments to being able to drive are not supported adequately.  There are other schemes that are just unaffordable for them.  This has a major impact on people's ability to socialise, live their lives, access education and work.  It is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> The other issue is the appeals and the fact that the waiting times for appeals are far too lengthy.  In Cork, the waiting time for applications, even within the strict criteria that exist, is several months and it is between seven and eight months for appeals.  That is holding people back from being able to live their lives.  Much of this comes back to the fact that parity of esteem has not been shown.  There is no respect for the needs of people with disabilities, particularly in this regard.  It is seen almost as a luxury rather than the necessity it definitely is.  That must change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600012#K00600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645008720,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I listened to the Minister of State's statement in which she spoke about root and branch change.

We have mentioned many other issues people have that do not fall under its remit at present.  It is very worrying.<\/p>  <p>  It also requires the involvement of all stakeholders.  That goes back to my opening remark about root and branch change.  I recall a number of years ago when I was on the town council.  We involved all the stakeholders, including the Irish Wheelchair Association and so forth, to try to come up with a popular plan for public transport in the area.  What evolved was that the town council at the time won a European mobility award because it took all the concerns on board for things such as easy access and crossing roads, the stuff able-bodied people take for granted.  We need a rapid change on this.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Regional Group for bringing this motion before the House because there is also the mental, not to mind the social, impact that affects people.

Alarm bells have been ringing since the entire board of the disabled drivers medical board of appeal resigned last October, concerned that a large number of drivers applying for tax reliefs were being turned down.  On average, less than 5% of appeals for primary medical certificates, which are necessary to apply for the scheme, are successful.  For years Sinn F&eacute;in and other representatives have raised the problems with the disabled drivers and passengers scheme with the Minister for Finance.  These include the rejection of applicants for the primary medical certificate, delays in decision making and qualifying criteria that exclude those with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2020, and Deputy Tully referred to this as well, the families of two children with disabilities won a Supreme Court appeal against the board for refusing them access to the scheme.  The court noted that the problem is with the under-inclusive nature of the legislation.  The scheme was then temporarily suspended before again taking assessments in January 2021.  It is clear that the Minister failed to respond to repeated criticisms of the scheme.  Ireland is in breach of its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by not addressing the problem.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister and the Government to read the Ombudsman's statement to the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  Mr. Tyndall delivered a damning indictment of the current scheme.  He said: \"There is no doubt in my mind that these criteria are excessively restrictive and that the administration of this scheme has resulted in people who do not meet the criteria, but who are just as immobile as those who do, being excluded from the scheme\".  Since 2016 the Ombudsman has received 335 complaints about the criteria.  That represents 335 individuals who are desperately trying to purchase or adapt a car for their use or the use of a family member.  A 2002 report on the scheme to the Minister for Finance recommended that the medical criteria should be based on lack of mobility as opposed to medical criteria.  This problem has been allowed to fester for more than 20 years and must be addressed immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Berry spoke about toilets and platforms in train stations in County Kildare.

It is a six-hour round trip to get to a hospital appointment in Galway.  We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis and the fact is that people with disabilities do not have the money to be able to go to their hospital appointments.

Do not forget we privatised and centralised everything because we thought that was a good idea without ever thinking about what transport links there would be for people.  It is the people who are most marginalised and who are on the lowest incomes who cannot get to where they need to go.  We created this social and economic exclusion and we must take ownership of it.

Then we decide it is a great idea to put a carbon tax on top of that, just in case people are not suffering enough.  If somebody with a disability who is on disability allowance wants to get to a hospital appointment, he or she has to forfeit the entire disability payment to be able to get to that appointment.

It is a motion about inclusion and ensuring the right to mobility and the associated independence for people with disabilities, and ensuring that people with disabilities can live full and active lives in our communities.  The motion is welcome and necessary, and it should be supported.  Government policy under successive governments has failed to deliver.  It has failed people with disabilities and impeded them.<\/p>  <p>  At a recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, we heard from representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind about the forthcoming road traffic Bill and about broader issues relating to access to transport.  The witnesses spoke about the importance of the primary medical certificate.  They pointed to the fact that the mobility allowance and the transport grant were stopped nearly a decade ago and have not returned.  They pointed to the broad suite of issues that continue to impede.  On the primary medical certificate they said: \"A review is required of the primary medical certificate.  It is as simple as that.  The sooner it can get under way, the better.\"<\/p>  <p>  They also argued that the certificate should be extended to include people with intellectual disabilities or autism, people who in the severe category will definitely never hold independent employment.  They said: \"They definitely need preferential parking for ease of access for their carers and themselves\".  Similarly, they pointed to the fact that blindness is not regarded as a qualifying criterion for the primary medical certificate, so a review of that is required.<\/p> <p>In addition, they pointed to the cases of people who are too visually impaired to drive but are not registered as blind and, as a result, are excluded from free travel.  That speaks to the failure of Government policy to respond to the needs of people with disabilities.  There are hundreds of people in this category but, like for so many people with a disability, the computer says \"No\".  There is no accommodation, understanding or common sense in the current systems and, as a result, people are excluded, disadvantaged and isolated.<\/p> <p>The primary medical certificate is only one aspect of this issue.  We need to replace the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant.  We need universal design of buses, trains, taxis and associated infrastructure.  We need public transport in the right place and at the right time that is accessible, available and affordable.  The same goes for streetscapes.  We need a full suite of supports to empower people and ensure they can travel independently.  It should not be an after-thought, as it is, at best, in many cases currently.  Rather, it should be built into everything we do - literally and figuratively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600013#L00700","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645009320,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Like the previous speakers, the Labour Party welcomes the motion, which focuses on people with disabilities and support for them in the area of transport.  As the previous speaker, an Teachta O'Rourke, stated, this has been an area of focus for us on the transport committee in the past 18 months.  As was mentioned, representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association and the National Council for the Blind recently appeared before the committee to give first-hand accounts of the barriers, difficulties and everyday obstacles their members and service users face in going about their daily lives.<\/p><p>Last week on Second Stage of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which is a technical Bill on changing of the reporting duties of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, to the Minister for Justice, we discussed how to disability-proof our entire policy-making in every area.  That is a massive responsibility for the Minister and the Government.  In the area of transport, we need to replace the mobility aids and mobility transport schemes that were cut in 2013, but we also need to look at investing in the public transport system and making sure it is truly disability-proofed.<\/p><p>Electric buses are currently being rolled out in Dublin.  Hydrogen buses are being trialled.  These are all very positive moves in the context of climate action, but there are still wheelchair users who, no matter what way the buses powered, cannot get on them.  They are still excluded.  I am working with a really good activist who has been engaging with Dublin Bus and other transport providers on that very issue.  Climate action is vital.  It is a pillar of every decision we need to make but equally important is true access.  In the context of trains, it is about ensuring that there are level access platforms rather than people having to ring ahead to ensure there is someone there to help them on or off the train.  We need lifts that actually work so that people do not have to go past Skerries train station, to Balbriggan, to go up a lift that they hope works in order to get to the other side of the platform and then have to wait an hour to get a train 2 km back down the track.  These are the realities for people with disabilities.  We try to highlight it as much as possible in the House.  We may have another debate on it next week or next month or it may come up at the committee in six weeks but these people will have to get the train or the bus tomorrow.<\/p><p>Many of them do not have the financial ability to purchase a car they need.  I represent a constituency that has a large rural base.  We will never be able to get buses up every boreen of north County Dublin, so people will need cars that are suitable to their needs.  From 2030 onwards, those will need to be electric cars.  What is the plan there?  I have asked the Minister, Deputy Ryan, several times about a scrappage scheme that will first cater for people with disabilities to ensure they can genuinely afford a disabled-accessible car that is also climate friendly.  It is 2022.  These plans will have to begin to be formulated and policies put in place and rolled out from the middle to the later part of this decade in order to meet the targets for 2030.  People with disabilities need to be at the forefront of this.  <\/p><p>Reference has been made to the Indecon research report on the cost of living for people with disabilities.  It is a powerful piece of research.  On average, the extra cost is &euro;9,500 to &euro;11,700 a year.  It costs people with disabilities a quarter of the industrial wage on top just to try to live an independent life, eat, get from A to B and C, and heat their homes.  During the pandemic, many people did a significant amount of unsung heroic work.  I am sure all present can attest to that and are aware of examples of it.  One such example is taxi drivers who have vehicles that cater for people with disabilities.  They did an awful lot of <i>pro bono<\/i>work to get people to hospital appointments, Covid tests and anywhere else they needed to go.  It goes unheralded that when those taxi drivers who have vehicles that many other people in their industry or people with disabilities do not have were called upon by their communities and people who needed it, many of them stepped up and were able to fill a gap.  That is not a system, however; it is people's charity and goodwill.  We need a system.<\/p><p>The Minister of State gets it, but across Government, from transport right through to every other area, we need to place people with disabilities first.  We need it in the housing sector.  We need to ensure that a portion of every development being built has houses that are not just wheelchair accessible, but wheelchair livable, so that people can live in every single room.  They need to be able to cook in the kitchen and have enough space to get around a table or into a living room.  It is not just about getting into the hall; it is about being able to live in the home.  Whether it be the State or private developers building homes, the State needs to impose regulations that ensure a proportion of homes for people with disabilities must be provided.<\/p><p>This country will be great is when that is being done, those targets are being met and we are putting people who are on the margins first.  We pride ourselves as being a country of great charity, and we are - we do want to help people and have a sisterhood and brotherhood with those on the margins and other people who are oppressed - but this State has a less than proud history of putting in place policies and supports for those who need them.  At the moment, and for many years gone by, people with disabilities have been on the margins rather than being placed front and centre of policy decision-making.  That has to stop.  We are a rich country with only 5.5 million people.  No one in this country should be in need or want or left on the margins.  This should be a wonderful place to live for everyone.  What the motion calls for in the area of transport is modest in the overall scheme of things but it would be transformative for people with disabilities.  I commend the motion to the House and look forward to listening to the rest of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600014#M00200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1645009320,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this important and timely motion.  The cost of disability report is a bleak overview of the increased annual financial burden that is associated with having a disability in Ireland.  It costs between &euro;9,500 and &euro;11,700 more every year to live with a disability.  To put this in context, the standard rate of disability allowance is &euro;10,816 per annum.  It barely covers the additional costs in most cases.  Mobility, transport and communication represent almost one quarter of the extra expense.  People who are blind or have a serious vision impairment have to pay &euro;737 extra.  For individuals with mobility difficulties it is &euro;500, while for those with chronic illnesses it is between &euro;600 and &euro;735.  That is money that is either difficult to afford or simply cannot be afforded.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on transport.  From the outset, we should consider what transport represents.  Transport is accessibility and independence.  It provides disabled people with the freedom to make autonomous decisions about what they will do with their day.<\/p>  <p>Transport is employment.  It helps people to get to, and retain, their jobs.  Regrettably, we have one of the lowest rates of employment for disabled people in the EU and OECD.  Transport is education.  It allows people to get to college and school.  A total of 13.7% of people with a disability aged 15 to 50 have not progressed beyond primary education and people with a disability are less likely to complete third-level education.  Transport is being able to socialise.  People with a disability are at risk of increased social isolation, especially in rural areas.<br\/><br\/>Transport is essential for independent living.  It is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Successive Governments have failed individuals and families in exercising this right and it is having knock-on effects in employment, education, socialising and independence.  This simply has to change.<br\/><br\/>The discontinuation of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant for new applicants in 2013 was disgraceful in itself but it was supposed to be temporary.  That no adequate replacement has been developed in the nine years since these schemes were closed is truly shocking.  Responsibility for this lies with Fine Gael for the decision to end this important support and for the decision not to replace it for almost a decade.  Many people with disabilities and support organisations expressed their concern in 2013 but the Government assured them this was only an interim measure and a replacement scheme would be provided.  Nine years later, disabled people and their families are still waiting.<br\/><br\/>The Government has also created a deeply unfair situation whereby those already in receipt of these supports continue to receive them but others in exactly the same position cannot access these or alternative supports.  This issue is yet another clear violation of individual rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is a violation of the right to equal access to transportation in Article 9 and to independent living in Article 19. <br\/><br\/>The then Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, published a scathing report on this situation in November 2021 entitled &quot;Grounded: unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes&quot;.  This is unequivocal in its assessment that successive Governments have failed disabled people.  In his conclusion, Mr. Tyndall wrote:<\/p><blockquote>\tnine years later, there is no evidence of any real progress that would serve to enhance the lives of those for whom these schemes were intended to assist with their daily lives.  This is of huge concern to me. <\/blockquote> <p>Schemes such as the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant are targeted supports that involve relatively small amounts in the scale of the national budget but can make a massive difference in the lives of individuals and their families.  It is simply disgraceful and wrong that they have not been replaced. <br\/><br\/>The motion also calls for the primary medical certificate process to be reinstated and amended as it is not fit for purpose.  The disabled drivers and passengers scheme provides for tax relief on adapted vehicles for disabled people, including children.  It should be a simple and clear tool to help individuals and families be able to travel around safely.  Instead, it is a bureaucratic and slow process that leaves people without suitable transport.  It has extremely stringent criteria, such as the need to be without both hands or without both arms or without one or both legs, before access to the scheme can be granted.  My colleague, Deputy Cairns, recently raised the issue of a young woman who had to have her hand amputated due to a rare form of cancer.  This young woman, who is adjusting to a life-changing situation, quickly discovered that because she only lost one hand she would not be able to get a primary medical certificate to adapt her car.  This has an impact on her ability to work, to care for her family and to live.  It is grotesque how wrong it is.<br\/><br\/>It took a Supreme Court case for one family to get the scheme in 2020.  It is a deeply flawed process.  The recent resignation <i>en masse <\/i>of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal demonstrates this.  The former board members had been calling for reform.  The Government failed to act and they felt compelled to resign rather than continue to oversee such a flawed scheme.<br\/><br\/>The disabled drivers and passengers scheme remains rooted in a harmful medical-model understanding of disability.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Irish Government policy call for the social model approach that focuses on the person and changing structural barriers.  The use of medical certificates and stringent criteria are not only antiquated, they are actively obstructing the independence and rights of disabled people.  We need a system that is less concerned with exact medical and physiological issues and more with the individuals and how they can be empowered to live as independent a life as possible.  We all know of cases where families have had to fundraise for adapted cars and vans for young children with disabilities.  The State is failing these children and adults who are just looking for a fair shot at being able to get an adapted vehicle.<br\/><br\/>Our underinvestment in public transport is another issue when considering mobility.  Many disabled people and others, including people who cannot afford a car and older people, rely on public transport.  In urban areas, we need improved public transport infrastructure to cater for additional needs.  The disability rights activists in Access for All regularly highlight issues.  Its Twitter account daily shows lifts that are not working in DART and train stations.  Yesterday there were eight such stations and there were seven on Monday.  Even worse, people may not know in advance whether the lifts are functioning.<br\/><br\/>Rural areas require greater investment in Local Link services to provide an expanded timetable into evenings to combat rural isolation and loneliness, as well as ensuring that all minibuses are wheelchair accessible.  There is a clear need for more sheltered bus stops.  It is essential that people have a sheltered place to wait for the bus in wet Irish weather.  This is as relevant for older people as it is for people with physical disabilities.  However, the National Transport Authority, NTA, informed me that it only installs about 100 sheltered stops annually due to cost and complications with installing.  Adding a sheltered stop is simple but has a big impact.  Every neighbourhood, town, and village should have at least one. <br\/><br\/>In 2013, the Fine Gael Government should have immediately replaced the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant.  The Government should have listened to the calls from disabled people and support organisations over the past nine years.  The disabled drivers and passengers scheme should have been reformed years ago.  The Cost of Disability in Ireland report should have been a wake-up call for the Government to the reality of living with a disability in Ireland.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report should have been a wake-up call.  The Supreme Court case and resignation of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal should have been a wake up call.  What will it take for the Government to wake up?  When will it do the right thing for people with disabilities and their families?  What more does it need to act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600014#M00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645009920,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for tabling this very important motion.  As has already been said, the question of transport for people with disabilities is absolutely critical.  Without a decent transport system, every aspect of their lives is diminished.  This includes access to education, employment, a social life and everything.  As a result, people with disabilities suffer disproportionately from poverty and in terms of the impact on their mental health.  This is not merely grossly unfair because if we are serious about the UNCRPD we are, in fact, also infringing their rights.  We are failing to vindicate the rights of huge numbers of people who have a disability.  This failure has continued.<\/p>  <p>  I was a member of the finance committee when the issue arose of there being a problem with the mobility transport grant and motorised grant.  This was because it was discriminatory and if we opened it up it would cost a fortune so, therefore, we would have to reconsider the entire thing.  It has been left on ice for eight years with no financial support for people.  It is absolutely outrageous penny-pinching and the impact is pretty severe.<\/p>  <p>  I want to instance one example of something that points to solutions and to the failure of the Government in this regard.  I have raised this repeatedly.  I think I have raised it with the Minister of State.  I have certainly raised it with the Taoiseach.  It sums things up.  This morning, my office spoke to the group Accessible Community Transport Southside Limited, ACTS.  It provides a door-to-door service.  It was doing 1,100 trips a month prior to Covid and this reduced to 550 during Covid.  As a result, this impacted on its ability to generate funding.<\/p>  <p>  People cannot use their free travel pass on this scheme because it does not come under the Department of Transport.  Ironically, Dublin Bus and Transport for Ireland advertise this door-to-door transport scheme for people with disabilities on their websites but do not give a cent towards it.  Nobody will take any responsibility for this.  The Department of Transport does not want it and the Department of Health does not want it.  Will it go to the Department with responsibility for disability?  We are not quite sure.  Perhaps it will.  The point is that for the want of &euro;53,000 in immediate funding, it could close down.  I understand it met the Minister of State.  The last I heard, which was today, was that it had not heard back.<\/p> <p>Therefore, the group still does not know whether it is going to get the money.  It needs &euro;250,000 to replace its fleet.  It used to have ten buses and now it is down to four.  This is disgraceful, given it is such a fantastic service.  It is disgraceful that those who use the service cannot do so for free.  The fare structure, which is necessary if the group is to fund itself, is such that &euro;12 is charged for a journey between 0 km and 5 km and &euro;16 is charged for a journey from 5 km to 8 km.  As much as &euro;35 is charged for a journey between 25 km to 32 km.  Those concerned have to do flag days and stand outside shopping centres collecting money.  It is outrageous.<\/p> <p> There are similar services with which I am not as familiar, including Easy-Cab Travel Club, Lucan Disability Action Group, Cork Accessible Transport and Vantastic.  They should be part of the public transport system and should be funded.  They should not have to organise flag days and all the rest of it to avoid the possibility of closing down because of a lack of funding.  They should not have to have me come in here essentially begging on their behalf.  I hope this will be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  Public transport has a responsibility.<\/p> <p> There are many with disabilities who cannot access a normal bus service because services are overcrowded and because there is only one wheelchair space on a bus.  There are similar issues associated with the DART.  In this regard, I want to raise the Access for All Ireland campaign.  I pay tribute to Mr. Bernard Mulvany and Sean O'Kelly, who have campaigned so consistently.  Again, they are substituting for the failures of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Department of Transport and so on.  What do they do?  They send texts to people saying the lift is not working at such a DART station and that if people go there they will be trapped or unable to get on the train.  This happens to people regularly.  Mr. Mulvany told me this morning that there are three different portals with information on what is happening in each DART station.  One is online and its information never correlates with what is actually going on at the station.  Another comprises the displays at the station, which show information that is different from the information online.  Another portal, which, apparently, is somewhat reliable, is the office putting the information together.  Therefore, there are three sources of information on whether the lift is working.  Lifts are constantly breaking down.  We have removed personnel from many DART stations.  If you go to one and there is nobody to help you with your problem, you are in trouble, which in itself is a disgrace.  We should put staff back in the DART stations.<\/p> <p> The other point Mr. Mulvany raised - I was not aware of it - is that people in rural areas still have to give 24 hours' notice to get on a train or bus.  That is outrageous.  We had a fight up here about that and there were some improvements.  While it is still far from perfect in Dublin, 24 hours' notice must be given in rural Ireland.  Where is the equality in that?<\/p> <p> This links to many things, including our failure to take seriously the UNCRPD and our ongoing failure to sign up to the optional protocol.  Ireland is one of two countries that has not signed up to it.  Why?  It is because we are afraid we will be caught out.  Ireland has one of the lowest levels of subsidy for public transport in general anywhere in Europe.  We are penny-pinching with public transport generally by comparison with our European counterparts.  Ours is more expensive, less frequent and less reliable.  While it hurts everybody, it hurts people with disabilities most.  As a result, they cannot trust the public transport system or risk using it.<\/p> <p> In Canada, brilliant services similar to ACTS have been institutionalised.  As the state directly funds them, people do not have to worry about organising flag days and whether funding will be available.  They do not have to charge fares to their customers because the public transport system provides a door-to-door service to people with disabilities.  That is the sort of service we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600015#N00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645010520,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We have heard again that a person must give 24 hours' notice to get public transport.

For example, a completely blind person cannot qualify to be a disabled passenger.  How outrageous is that?  As far as this State is concerned, a person registered as blind and who cannot see anything is not entitled to be a disabled passenger in a supported car because he or she does not qualify or tick the box.

The unit is attached to the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in Kilbrittain National School and plays a vital role in providing early support to children with ASD before they start school.

The early intervention unit in Kilbrittain was opened in 2019 and has been an enormous asset to the school community.

The calls made on the Government and the Minister of State in the motion are eminently reasonable and absolutely doable.  The motion looks at specific barriers to mobility and transport that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives.  This could be accessing their work, their education, their health needs, their social lives - as I said, their day-to-day lives, just like the rest of us.  I listened to the Minister of State's contribution this morning and have listened to her previous contributions on this issue and I believe she is determined to put in place a system that is equitable for people with disabilities.  However, we are a year and a half into the term of this Government and only now is the transport working group really beginning its work.  Yes, the Government inherited a situation that is far from ideal, but that is its responsibility now and that is the situation in which we find ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  Last year the then Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, said that personal transport supports for people with disabilities are \"inadequate, unfair and inequitable\".  That is an independent voice saying that, so we must listen and act.  He spoke of the fact that his office, just like all our offices, receives constant complaints about all the mobility schemes, whether the motorised transport scheme, now entering its ninth year of suspension, the mobility allowance or the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  As signatories to the UNCRPD, we have a responsibility to provide access to transport on an equal basis to persons with a disability in order that they too can live independent lives and participate fully in all aspects of life.  For any of us, life is not a dress rehearsal; it is today and it is now.  It is the very same for people with disabilities.  They want to live their lives every day just like the rest of us, but, because their mobility and their access to either transport or mobility grants or assistance are severely compromised or, in some cases, non-existent, they are left waiting in the wings while the rest of us get on with our lives.  Time is of the essence.  We need a sense of urgency and immediacy on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Just recently - last week, in fact - I read the final report from Indecon on the cost of disability in Ireland.  One of the findings of that report that struck me very forcibly was that the costs relating to transport and mobility were so significant for people.  For example, the average extra yearly living cost due to disability that persons with disability could not afford - and the crucial point is that they could not afford them - under the heading of transport was over &euro;3,000 per year.  While the survey showed that the highest costs incurred by people with disabilities related to access to adequate housing, the second highest related to trying to access transport and mobility support.  We therefore have had, as far back as 2012, the then Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, telling us the motorised transport grant was not fit for purpose, we have had many interventions from the Ombudsman's office in the intervening years, we have had report after report, culminating in the cost of disability report last November, but people with disabilities are still waiting.  They wait while the rest of us move on, get on with our lives and fly by them.  It is the Minister of State's responsibility to change fundamentally that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600017#P00600","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1645011120,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion regarding mobility and transport supports for people with disabilities.  I completely support the motion.  As it rightly states, Ireland is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which calls on countries to provide access to transportation on an equal basis to enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life.  What is the point in putting our name to these conventions if we are not going to act on them or put them into practice?  People with disabilities should be able to live a full and independent life and should be given the same opportunities as everyone else to be fully active in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  The transport system in this country is not only completely inadequate but is a system of inequality.  Transport services for those with disabilities are few and far between, especially in my constituency of Donegal, where the transport infrastructure continues to lag behind the rest of the country.  I have been contacted by many constituents who are becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of mobility and transport supports, especially since the scaling back of these supports during Covid-19.  Indeed, even for people to use the likes of the rail service, they have to book in advance and have to book for somebody to be there.  Very often what happens now in the train stations in Dublin is that people are not there to meet them, so they cannot get off the train.  That is just wrong and should not be allowed to continue.  The lack of support means that many people with disabilities are missing out on employment, sports, entertainment and other activities.  This is not only incredibly discriminatory, but we as a society lose out when we do not ensure that all people can participate fully and freely in our communities.  We are also losing out on a very important perspective and voice when we do not ensure that everybody has a seat at the table.  We should encourage those with disabilities to engage in public spaces and to participate in activism and politics.  They are an important voice which is lacking in most decision-making roles in this country, and that needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  We can make these changes in a number of ways.  We need a complete review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  The scheme's eligibility criteria are extremely limited and exclude many people who are in need of access to these supports for personal transport.<\/p> <p>Keeping it extremely limited is deliberate, perhaps not on the part of the Minister of State but on Government's part.  Historically, it has controlled access to the supports.  That is wrong.  We also need a replacement scheme for the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant.  It is a disgrace that nothing has replaced this allowance since it was discontinued in 2013.  Those who relied on this allowance and the grant have been left without it for almost a decade.  I call on the Government to replace both with a new and equal scheme as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> I also call on the Government to reinstate the primary medical certificate, however, not in its current form which is not fit for purpose.  This is a big issue in my constituency and I have been contacted by many constituents who have clear evidence and documentation of their disability, but somehow do not meet the very limited primary medical certificate criteria.  It should be the case that if a GP believes a person should qualify for a primary medical certificate, he or she should be given this as an automatic right.<\/p> <p> As well as these changes, we need to ensure that disability services are returned to full capacity in order for people with disabilities to continue to live full and active lives.  Donegal disability centres, such as Cashel na Cor in Buncrana, are still working at reduced capacity.  I have been contacted by constituents in regard to the ongoing situation at the centre where service users can only get two days per week at the centre.  This is very upsetting for service users and their families.  The service users are adults and many of their parents and carers who are elderly and need the service to return to at least a five-day-per-week service.  This is the least they hope for.<\/p> <p> I hope the Government will act on this sooner rather than later and that it takes the steps necessary to ensure a fair and equal society for all in this country.  That is vital.  It should be our role to ensure that everybody can access fair and equal services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600017#P00700","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645011720,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The issues relating to transport for people with disabilities have been raised at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters on a weekly basis.  Issues with the primary medical certificate and the workings of the certificate are constantly being brought up.  In the first instance, the primary medical certificate as it is currently constituted is not fit for purpose.  When it is not, it is very restrictive.  If that is to be basis for providing aid or transport for people with disabilities, we need to make sure that everybody who has a disability is included in that scheme.  That is the first review we need to look at.  We must make sure the primary medical certificate is fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  This matter has been ongoing.  There was a court case in 2020 - nearly two years ago - and there is the issue with appeals.  The people who resigned from the appeals board were very clear.  They said it was not fit for purpose and they put it to the Government and the Departments of Finance, Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to make sure that a new scheme that was fit for purpose was put in place.  If one message is to be taken from this debate, it is that we must be very clear regarding that ongoing review should be completed quickly in order to ensure that there is no delay and that the new scheme is brought forward as a matter of urgency.  There are people who are hurting because of what is happening.  There who are people making decisions and who cannot get access to transport and so forth.  The scheme needs to be put in place as a matter of urgency.  I ask the Government and the Minister and Minister of State to make sure it happens as a matter of extreme urgency.<\/p>  <p>  In the time I have left, I wish to raise one other matter.  In the debate, we talked about disabilities and the various challenges facing the disability side.  One challenge is the assessment of need and the therapies required afterwards.  The latter are non-existent in the public sphere.  A significant effort is being made to recruit people into the HSE to provide the services as well as for the different schemes that are changing.  The Government needs to look at how we are failing in terms of reducing the numbers on waiting lists and must make sure that proper assessments of need are conducted and that appropriate therapies are offered to families.  The money should be following the person who needs to access the therapies.  We should look at that to see if it is humanly possible to make sure everybody who is reaching out for therapies receive them.  Many people have gone into private practice.  Some have left public practice to go into private practice, which is very unusual, because of the frustrations within the public sphere.  That is an issue we need to look at.

I welcome this motion from my fellow Deputies, but we cannot focus solely on adaptive cars.  We need to be broader minded as to what an inclusive transport system means.  People with disabilities walk, cycle and wheel, if our built environment does not disable them.  Our record on the rights of people with disabilities has been abysmal to date, nowhere more so than in our public spaces.  We see so-called kissing gates installed by local authorities blocking access to public amenities.  We see drivers parking cars on paths, parking in disabled parking spaces and we see poorly designed cycle lanes that do not enable people using trikes or hand cycles to use them.  We must ensure that people with disabilities have the right to access our public spaces, because people with disabilities have the right to the same opportunity of access to education, employment and public amenities.  This is not something that is nice to have; it is a right.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is honouring its commitment to invest in public transport and active travel.  Our national technical standards for designing and delivering this infrastructure must be inclusive.  We await the national cycle manual from the National Transport Authority and we await every single local authority to avail of national funding and deliver quality mobility networks so that everyone can safely and comfortably move around, particularly if they cannot or chose not to drive.  We need to recognise that road safety is predominantly a design issue.  Our national design manual for urban roads and streets clearly outlines that priority must be given to a hierarchy of road users, that is vulnerable road users; people walking, cycling and rolling; public transport; and, lastly, private car traffic.  A 30 km\/h speed limit is proven to reduce fatalities and serious injuries from collisions, yet it is not the default speed limit outside every school and throughout our town centres.<\/p>  <p>  We need to recognise the part road design plays in acquired disability.  We have the data.  We know three out of four people injured in road traffic collisions who were admitted to National Rehabilitation Hospital suffered a traumatic brain injury.  For every pedestrian killed on our roads, eight are seriously injured.  For every person who has been killed on out roads while cycling, 25 others have been seriously injured.  Serious injuries from road traffic collisions can result in people living with spinal injuries, the loss of a limb and a lifetime of chronic pain.  Serious injuries from road traffic collisions have a devastating impact on the person and that impact sends shock waves beyond the person's circle of family and friends.  These statistics represent people whose lives are altered forever.  We need to make sure our streets are designed so that they cause no harm.  We need to make sure our streets and transport system is designed to allow every member of our community to live as full and independent a life as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600018#Q00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1645011720,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for this motion, which gives us the opportunity to discuss these important issues.  I emphasise, on behalf of the Government, our commitment to support people with disabilities and to the progressive realisation of our UNCRPD commitments.  There is a real complexity in the issues discussed.  They include issues we are already working on to address so we can improve and strengthen the transport supports available to people with disabilities.  I am glad that work is ongoing within the framework of the interdepartmental working group on transport in view of the different needs of people with disabilities around this country.<\/p>  <p>  We need to give this work the time to be carried out for us to get it right and move forward by properly calibrating our supports and making the best use of our resources.  At a whole-of-government level, the national disability inclusion strategy, which has been extended to the end of 2022, sets the overall framework through which the rights of people with disabilities under the UNCRPD can be advanced.  Under the strategy, a number of Departments have responsibility for delivering on those transport commitments.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State outlined the work being done by Government colleagues.  In closing this discussion, I want to highlight that work and point to the level of commitment, the complexity, and the opportunity for future co-ordination.  The Minister for Transport acknowledges the important role transport plays in all our lives and is particularly conscious of the concerns in regard to making public transport accessible for all.  The Minister is committed to progressively making public transport accessible for people with disabilities, including in rural areas, by ensuring that new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and retrofitting older infrastructure.<\/p> <p>He secured &euro;13.35 million in budget 2022 for this purpose.  In line with Article 9 of the UNCRPD, the National Transport Authority supports persons with disabilities to travel independently on public transport networks through initiatives like the Just a Minute card for anyone with a communication difficulty and the provision of disability awareness training to public transport staff.  Further, the travel assist scheme currently provides free assistance for people who need it in accessing public transport or to plan public transport journeys in the greater Dublin area.  The extension of this scheme to the Cork area is going to be piloted this year.<\/p> <p> Looking at rural areas, last October the Minister for Transport joined the National Transport Authority to launch the public consultation on the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan.  Connecting Ireland is a major national public transport initiative developed by the National Transport Authority to increase public transport connectivity, particularly for people living outside major towns and cities.  We will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country.<\/p> <p> On the free travel scheme provided by the Department of Social Protection, a recommendation in the 2017 Make Work Pay report has resulted in the introduction of changes to the way in which people with disabilities who get employment can retain access to the free travel scheme.  Persons with disabilities who receive the partial capacity benefit may hold on to it to allow them to return to work.  As transport supports for people with disabilities are the responsibility of a variety of Departments and agencies, it is appropriate that the Government would use the interdepartmental transport group, chaired by the Minister of State and operating within the framework of the national disability inclusion strategy, as the forum within which to address this issue in a holistic way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600018#Q00400","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645012320,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Lockdown has been a terrible experience for us all, confined to our own communities for weeks on end.

We want the Government to provide the funding to establish a comprehensive set of transport supports for people with a disability as a matter of priority.  These people are effectively being marooned and isolated in their own homes and they have experienced this for the last nine years.<\/p>  <p>  Households with a disability spend, on average, more than &euro;9,000 on items explicitly relating to that disability, such as unique versions of products, transport and mobility.  These are additional living costs for people with disabilities on top of the dramatic increases we have seen in the cost of living for everyone else.  The curtailment in supports for people with a disability in terms of transport have come on foot of interventions either by the courts or by the office of the Ombudsman.  Because of the political implications of these decisions, the Minister of the day would have received a clear indication of what was coming down the track.  The Government was forewarned yet we are still waiting, nine years down the road, to see any action.  It is time now to implement a transport scheme that works for people with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  Nine years ago, the Government suspended the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant for new applicants.  It promised at the time that it would put an alternative, fair and equal replacement scheme in place.  That never happened.  The motorised transport grant was a means tested payment to help someone to buy a car so that they could retain employment.  The mobility allowance was a means tested monthly payment for people who could not walk and could not use public transport.  In her contribution earlier, the Minister of State was critical of us for not coming up with a solution.  As her colleague, the senior Minister, clearly indicated, this is a complex issue and one on which I worked very closely with the former Minister of State, Finian McGrath.  Alternative supports were proposed to Government at that time.  Of course, sign-off was never secured.  Deputy Leddin is right about the issue of universal design.  Deputy Stanton and I have been campaigning on that issue for many years.  It needs to be integrated into all strata of our society.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2020, the disabled driver scheme was suspended.  Again, the Government had been given the heads-up on what was going to happen.  The scheme provides tax reliefs for the purchase and adaptation of vehicles.  The terms and conditions of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme have never rested easy with Members of the Oireachtas.  It has always been totally inadequate as a scheme and never met the genuine needs of people with disabilities.  Instead of trying to address the nonsensical and extremely dated conditions of the scheme, the Government has just reinstated it in primary legislation.  In order to be eligible for the tax reliefs under that scheme, the only scheme available at the moment for people with disabilities who cannot access public transport, they have to be without the use of both legs or without the use of both hands or both arms, or without one or both legs.  If they have the use of one leg, then they can only avail of the scheme if they do not have the use of both hands or arms.  Someone who cannot use their arms but can use their legs is denied access to it.  This archaic scheme is in need of radical reform.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the Government is coming forward with a review of the scheme.  However, we are hearing about review after review of it.  We have no commitment on deadlines or that the recommendations that come out of the national inclusion strategy will be implemented in a timely manner.  To be isolated in one's own home for 460 weeks is totally unacceptable.  People with a disability today are effectively marooned in their own homes.  They cannot participate in their own communities or take up worthwhile employment because of the lack of access to basic supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600019#R00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1645012320,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for their contributions.  The Regional Group's contribution is that we need a scheme that will work, that will offer support to those who have mobility issues and allow them some independence so they are no longer grounded, as stated by Peter Tyndall.<\/p>  <p>  Back in 2011, Emily O'Reilly stated that the scheme, and the requirement to hold a primary medical certificate, were wrong and did not comply with the Equal Status Act.  It is not the fault of the Green Party or Fianna F&aacute;il; they have been in government for the past two years.  Really, the reaction of Governments has been to suspend a scheme if there is a problem with it.  They say they will look at it and bring something forward in the future.  As Members of the Oireachtas, there are many things we are not very proud of when we look at people with disabilities.  This is one way of fixing one small problem for a cohort who are imprisoned in their homes at the moment.  We talk about public transport and what we can do there.  That is fine and we will do it but it will happen over long years.  People will still be in their homes unable to go to work or go out and do their shopping.  They will not have that independence which they so deserve.  The message is not so much that the Government is not doing anything.  We have to speed up this process.  The chair of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters has said that as well.<\/p> <p>We need to do it as quickly as possibly in a timeframe that will give hope.  Timelines need to be put on all the discussions that are currently ongoing.<\/p> <p> The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, said that the criteria for the primary medical certificate scheme are extremely limited and excessively restrictive.  He explained that this has resulted in people who do not meet the criteria but are just as immobile as those who do being excluded from the scheme.  The idea of this scheme should not be to exclude people who need it; it should be do include people who deserve it.  It is a basic right and we should just put it in place.  There will be challenges.  I would tell both Ministers that the challenges will be with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to get the money to put this in place.  It is terribly frustrating for people with disabilities.  Everyone wants to do something that is right yet when it comes to paying for it the money is cut off.  We have to get over that and now is the time to do that.  We need timelines for the new scheme being put in place.<\/p> <p> I refer to the appeals process.  People in my constituency of Galway East have to travel up to D&uacute;n Laoghaire for an appeal.  These are people who have mobility issues.  Let us think about that.  It is all wrong.  We must ensure that there is a personalised support for people who need it.  That is what we need to do and not drag people all over the country to try to prove a disability that sometimes they will have had since birth.  I have a case of a young child who is blind and the family needs a car adapted.  Whenever they try to get anything, like the primary medical certificate, the first thing the parents must do is prove the child is blind.  The child is blind and is permanently blind.  That is wrong and it is an indictment of what we have set up here.  I wish the Ministers here well and we are here to support them in making sure that whatever we do, we do it right for those who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600019#R00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645012920,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Motion agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1645012920,"counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600020#S00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1645012920,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Imp&iacute;m ar Theachta&iacute; agus ar An Taoiseach na srianta ama a chomhl&iacute;onadh.

The case sparked outrage and anger.  At the time the Taoiseach described the incident as &ldquo;a truly scandalous situation&rdquo;.  We were told this should not have happened and the cry from the Government was one of never again.  In November of that same year, a 91-year-old man spent 30 hours on a hospital trolley.  The Taoiseach's response was that the then Taoiseach and the Minister for Health must take responsibility for the ongoing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Fast forward six years to today, on his watch as Taoiseach, figures show that in January alone, nearly 1,100 patients aged 75 years and over were lying on trolleys for 24 hours and more.  The Taoiseach was right in 2015 when he said that one elderly patient lying on a trolley was scandalous.  That 1,100 elderly patients were left waiting on a trolley in a single month is 1,100 scandals, one after the other.  Numbers are very clinical.  Numbers are not personal but every one of these 1,100 is a person, somebody&rsquo;s grandfather, grandmother, mother, father, brother or sister; somebody's loved one.<\/p>  <p>  This crisis has not fallen out of the sky.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has been ringing the alarm bell at the Government for weeks and weeks.  It says were face an extremely dangerous situation and that in some cases it is the worst the organisation has ever seen.  Yet the Minister for Health sits on his hands and the HSE fails to act.  On 25 January, University Hospital Limerick registered a record number of people on trolleys for a hospital for a 24-hour period.  That same day, trolley figures across the State hit a two-year high.  Yesterday, in the Taoiseach's own neck of the woods, Cork University Hospital registered its highest number of patients recorded on trolleys since the trolley count began.<\/p>  <p>  The big question that arises this morning is what exactly is the Minister for Health doing.  What exactly is the HSE doing?  The Taoiseach tells us we have to pay big bucks to get big results.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is paid &euro;225,000, Paul Reid of the HSE is paid &euro;412,000 and Robert Watt who is the Secretary General of the Department is paid &euro;298,000.  I believe that when you pay people that kind of money you expect big results.  You expect that the job is done.  Yet promise after promise has been made but we still have a crisis in GP provision, we do not have enough inpatient beds or enough community recovery beds and the scandal of trolleys continues.  Despite paying these three men almost &euro;1 million between them, the root causes of hospital overcrowding persist.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im tagtha ar&iacute;s leis an bpl&oacute;d&uacute; in&aacute;r n-ospid&eacute;il.

Without question that there have been record attendances in our emergency departments over the last month.  The situation is very challenging in many emergency departments across the country with those record attendances.  What is more worrying is the preponderance or majority of those over 75 years are presenting to emergency departments with more acute illnesses than would have been the case in previous times.  The clinicians on the ground say that this is a legacy arising from the Covid period because people did not present earlier during the pandemic for obvious reasons.  There were lockdowns and most recently during Omicron elective procedures were de-escalated and diagnostics were not at the same levels.  For example, cancer biopsies or attendances went down by 15% in 2020.  In the next period, we will witness delayed diagnosis coming to the fore, more acute illness, more acute cancer presentations because Covid meant that people did not get the earlier interventions that would have been the norm without the pandemic.  That is the reality.  That is notwithstanding the fact that we have dramatically invested and increased home package care hours, for example.  Some 55,000 families now benefit from homecare packages that are fully funded.  However, there is a problem around hospital discharging as Deputies will be aware.  Some 50% of nursing homes and community nursing units have had Covid outbreaks now.  The regulations governing that mean they cannot accept new patients for about 28 days.  We understand why that regulation was put in.  I understand that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is examining that.  That has created a problem in egress from hospitals which, again, is a legacy of Covid.  Indeed, it is not just a legacy but a present-day reality of Covid which is preventing people from leaving hospitals when their care is complete.  Bed capacity has increased to record levels in the last 12 months.  Investment in health has been at record levels.  I think it has increased by &euro;6 billion since the original allocation of 2018.  There has been a range of innovations.  The Deputy mentioned GPs.  There has been huge investment in general practice service in the last two years, particularly around chronic disease management and GP access to diagnostics.  That has made dramatic progress.  Some 138,000 radiology scans were delivered in the community in 2021.  That reduces pressure on the acute services.<\/p> <p>However, we must respond to this current situation by pressing ahead with increased capacity on the acute side but also by examining the situation with nursing homes and community nursing units and further delivery of home care packages as well.  Across the board, a whole range of measures have been introduced because it is not just about one task force for one or two months of the year.  It must be a more holistic approach that is system-wide within the health service.  It must be on the primary care side, community care side and acute side and there must be discharge provision and capacity as well.  Government is working with the HSE to ensure we can do doing everything we possibly can to alleviate the pressures on emergency Departments right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600020#S00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645013520,"counter":97,"content":"<p>In those circumstances the Taoiseach and his Government are failing miserably in their task.  I do not accept his excuse this is a consequence of Covid.  For example, he said he would eliminate waiting lists when he was Minister for Health 20 years ago.

In 2015, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach's partner in government and a former Minister for Health, said people would be waiting no longer than 18 months to see a consultant.  Last month 155,000 people were waiting longer than 18 months.  I could go on and on.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is the failure lies with a lack of capacity; that is for sure.

It is a loaded term and suggests there is some kind of automated process that has gone awry in some way and there is no need to hold an individual or, indeed, an entity responsible.  A succession of scandals in the health service have been in the news in recent weeks.  Just yesterday, we learned of a further scandal in disability services in the north west.  A resident was able to access child exploitation material online on multiple occasions going back to 2016.  Basic safeguarding procedures seem to have been either ignored or abandoned.  Vulnerable children were seriously harmed in south Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Residents with intellectual disabilities in a care home in Donegal were sexually abused with impunity and a child, Grace, with special needs in the south east was abandoned to an abusive foster home.  Our most vulnerable citizens, who relied on the State to protect them, were instead physically, sexually or psychologically abused, and some of that went on for decades.  The abuse was not a secret.  People in positions of power knew what was going on.<\/p>  <p>  In Donegal, the staff and management in that care home were aware of the horrific sexual abuse being perpetrated by a resident called Brandon.  Their response to the abuser was to move him to different wards where he had new victims who were non-verbal and unable to advocate for themselves.  They were left to suffer for a decade.  The DPP has directed there will be no prosecutions in that case.  We may never know the full extent of the abuse suffered by Grace.  The State was supposed to protect her but instead it sent her to live with demons.  They tortured her for about 20 years.  In addition to Grace, the whistleblowers paid a hefty price.  We recently learned the DPP will not prosecute any of the officials or State agencies that had a duty of care to Grace, despite the fact the Garda has recommended prosecutions for endangerment and negligence.  In south Kerry, hundreds of children and their families suffered unimaginable trauma when they were prescribed inappropriate medications and it had devastating consequences both physically and psychologically.  A rogue junior doctor who was not supervised or managed by anyone in senior management for years is probably going to take the fall.  The system will remain intact.<\/p>  <p>  All these scandals have a central feature, namely, that there is no accountability and a lack of consequences.  What is the Taoiseach going to do to consign the term \"system failure\" to history and instead have real accountability built into the system, accountability that has real consequences, including the possibility of prosecution?  Does the Taoiseach believe the lack of accountability undermines the vast majority of really good people who work in those services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600021#T01300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1645013520,"counter":109,"content":"<p>There has to be, and should be, accountability.  I am not clear what the Deputy is proposing.  These are very serious scandals in themselves, in terms of the Grace case and the case of Brandon and what transpired there.  The Deputy referenced the south Kerry CAMHS.  At this initial stage, I would put a question mark after the word \"rogue\".  I think that is judgmental of the individual because I do not believe it is one issue pertaining to one individual.  There are issues in terms of prescribing and so on but whether it was wilful or not is a separate matter.  That is part of the issue.  It is easy for us in the Oireachtas to make judgments but when it comes to the law, the legal system and people's rights and entitlements, it is a completely different arena, and people have rights and entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  It has been an accepted premise here that the DPP is independent of the political system.  It has been long argued but I do not see how we could change that.  I do not know whether the Deputy is suggesting we should change the status of the DPP and that there should be a different approach.  On balance and having witnessed things over the years, I would not agree with the idea that somehow the DPP should be answerable to the political system because I am not too sure justice would be done, if I am frank about it.  We have to be careful about that.  We can perhaps look at other mechanisms to get better insights or explanations as to why certain cases are not proceeding but that then could in itself jeopardise cases into the future because no case is ever closed and new evidence can emerge that can lead to cases being progressed.  The DPP must make assessments, and the Garda must make assessments on these matters.  I can understand why people are very unhappy, in that the Garda wished for a prosecution in this instance but the DPP took a view, probably looking at the entire case, and made determinations.  The DPP's office is independent of Government, and rightly so.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly speaking, as I have said before in the House, we have established numerous commissions of inquiry on a whole range of issues.  Invariably, one is never entirely satisfied with the length of time they take and the fact they never lead to prosecutions, because of their very nature, and can, in some instances, jeopardise prosecutions, in the sense there can often be a difficulty between the case being prosecuted in the courts and any material related to that prosecution being aired in a commission of inquiry.<\/p> <p>There are very real issues for us to reflect on and consider in respect of how best we pursue these issues between, on the one hand, trying to get the truth and the accountability question on the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600021#T01400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645014120,"counter":111,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's very first line that he does not know what it is I am proposing concerns me.  I am proposing that we build accountability into the system.  There has been a myriad of different reports.  When harm has been done, the first response tends to be about financial compensation, which is appropriate, but very often whistleblowers and people who have been harmed want more than that.  They want to be sure that the same people who have failed in their positions of responsibility will be held personally responsible and will not be there to repeat those failures.  We do not build those systems of accountability into our systems.  It is very obvious because week after week we hear of different scandals.  There is an origin for that.  How can someone move an abuser from one ward to another and not think that is wrong?  How can someone, for example, disregard things such as safeguarding and feel there is no accountability?

Accountability is built into systems, but people contest who is or is not accountable.  People will argue and will say it is not them but somebody else.

I have said previously that we need to build up the existing structures.

In other words, it is getting in there, doing unannounced inspections and forcing change in the system.

Recent correspondence from HIQA expressed concerns regarding a residential disability centre for adults in Donegal, where a resident accessed child sexual exploitation material on three separate occasions in 2016, 2017 and 2021.  The HIQA report states that the HSE has repeatedly &quot;failed to demonstrate fitness&quot; to safeguard residents with disabilities in its centres.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the only reason we know of this incident, and of HIQA correspondence, is due to a leak.  This is completely unacceptable and shows the ultimate problem here.  It was the same case with the Brandon report, which was another example of complete failure of HSE management.  The only reason this report came to light was that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and I continued to press the HSE regarding it.  The fact that a Minister of State had to continuously press the HSE in the first place just to get a copy of the Brandon report is extremely concerning and I ask the Taoiseach to consider this.  To date, the Brandon report has still not been published, despite the families&rsquo; wish to see the full report, and we are again relying on leaks for information.  Something needs to change here.  When discussing the Brandon report last year, I asked how we can be sure this will not happen again, how we can instil trust in HSE management and, in the case of failures occurring again, how we can ensure we are informed of them.  Sadly, months later we are again facing a similar situation and, again, the only reason we know about it is through leaks.  The Taoiseach needs to put people&rsquo;s minds at ease.  We have to know that this will not happen again and that if it does, at the very least, we have to know about it.<\/p><p>A pattern of failure seems to be emerging among HSE management.  We need an investigation into HSE management in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 area, but we also need an investigation into this community health organisation&rsquo;s relationship nationally.  That is a key part of this issue.  There are serious concerns about how residential centres are currently being managed in Donegal, in addition to Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and Monaghan, but I also have concerns regarding HSE management nationally and how the CHOs relate to national management.  We also need to address problems with HIQA.  I have concerns regarding its processes and I am wary of placing all the scrutiny on the HSE without recognising HIQA's role.<\/p><p>One way or another we urgently need an investigation into HSE management in CHO 1 and nationally.  We need to know how management is being held accountable and how we can know that this will not happen again.  Will the Taoiseach<b><\/b>ensure that necessary and timely investigations into HSE management take place, following the ongoing patterns of failure occurring in our residential centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600022#U00400","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1645014120,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising these issues, which are very serious and are taken very seriously by the Government.  As the Deputy said, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has worked with him in respect of the Brandon report, which is a shocking and very disturbing report.  What happened in that instance has caused enormous distress and hurt to the families involved.  A national independent review has been commissioned by the HSE to carry out a review of abuse allegations at a HSE-provided residential service for adults with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the advice, the Minister of State sought the Attorney General's advice regarding the publication of the full Brandon report.  As the Deputy knows, the HSE published the executive summary of that report last December.  The advice received was that it is a matter for the HSE and the Minister of State may not direct the HSE to publish the report.  The Garda is still completing its work and has advised the HSE against publication.  The HSE, as the body responsible for publication, has determined that the report should not be published in full, but we are not finished with that yet.  We will continue to pursue that because full transparency is required but, at the same time, we do not want to imperil or undermine any potential investigation the Garda may pursue regarding this.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the CHO 1 situation, HIQA advised the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State in December that the chief inspector had concerns about the ongoing governance of social care in CHO 1, including, as the Deputy outlined, a serious adult and child safeguarding concern.  HIQA conducted unannounced inspections of all HIQA-designated centres for people with disabilities in Donegal, except those that had been inspected since September 2021.  Preliminary feedback on the inspections has been provided to the HSE.  HIQA's report on the inspections is expected shortly.  I am advised, however, no issues were identified that have not been responded to appropriately, but we have to see the full report of those inspections.  There are concerns, which the Minister is pursuing further, about the broader area of establishing the response and capacity of the CHO 1 area in respect of senior management there and how it is handling cases, some of which date back to the management of cases in 2016 and 2017.  Terms of reference have been drawn up regarding that particular exercise.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy raised the issue of the HSE's nationwide response to matters of this kind.  In the first instance, the HSE has a national framework in which there has be to be full disclosure on issues such as this.  There are clear benchmarks against which it needs to be judged in fulfilling those objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600022#U00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1645014120,"counter":115,"content":"<p>On the CHO 1 issue, the Morris tribunal report covered the actions of the Garda.

That is why CHO 1's relationship, nationally, with HSE management also needs to be investigated.<\/p> <p> On the Brandon report specifically, the Minister of State said she cannot publish it, which is fair enough, but the HSE can.  That is a problem.  The HSE is a law unto itself here.  It works for us.  We do not work it.  The HSE works for the Irish people.  It is supposed to represent the Irish people not the other way around.  It seems it is the other way around when we are dealing with the HSE.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has completed its investigation in regard to the Brandon report so it cannot be held up as an excuse by the HSE.<\/p> <p> We need an investigation.

The facts do not support the Government's argument that the hike in the price of the barrel of oil is the main cause of skyrocketing petrol, diesel and home-heating costs.  This argument is wrong and misleading and I will explain why.  In 2008, the cost of a barrel of oil was $162, the cost of a litre of petrol was &euro;1.30 and a litre of diesel was &euro;1.42.  Today, the cost of a barrel of oil is $93, which is 74% lower than in 2008, but the cost of a litre of petrol is &euro;1.74 and the cost of a litre of diesel is &euro;1.64.  If the price of a barrel of oil is 74% lower, why are Irish consumers paying 34% per litre more?  As I said, in 2008 the price of a barrel of oil was $162.  Today, the cost of a barrel of oil is $93 yet the Government is saying the cost of the barrel of oil is the cause of high fuel prices.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax was first introduced in 2009 by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Carbon tax is the real reason for the increase in fuel prices and the pressure on people in terms of heating their homes.  The hauliers and the farmers came here to protest but the Government has done nothing to support them.  The price of oil is cheaper now than in 2008.  The Government's percentage model on taxes is costing every household more.  The Government needs to give the real facts and tell the public the problem is being caused by the carbon tax first introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in 2009.  That is a fact.  I am not making this up.  People can Google it and they will see it for themselves.  These are facts.  The price of the barrel of oil is $69 cheaper today than it was in 2008.  The Government is telling the people who are going hungry and who are cold in their homes that the problem is the price of the barrel of oil.

This was part of global protests by tens of millions of people who were opposition to war.

It has been presented with a report that is calling for a massive expansion in spending on the military.  A tripling of such expenditure is called for in one scenario - this is the supposed middle-ground scenario - and an increased of 50% is called for in another.  What other Department would get an increase of 50% in funding?  That is &euro;500 million more to be spent on warships or missiles.  That amount would be sufficient to fund the introduction of free public transport right across the country.  There are 44 references to NATO in the report in question.

The service is vast.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, the level of investment has gone up significantly.  It increased by billions of euro in the past number of years, particularly in the past two years, in terms of significant funding gone into the base of the HSE to provide additional services.  Reforms are happening also in respect of primary care and community care.  Home care packages have gone up by 2.7 million hours.  Some 55,000 families are now being provided with home care packages.  That is a dramatic increase from previous years.  The Deputies should acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  There are challenges and there are pressures, particularly in emergency departments, which are a legacy of emerging from Covid - delayed diagnosis, people not presenting during Covid, elective care being cancelled during Covid and diagnostics being cancelled.  Unfortunately, all that will have an impact over the next 12 months.  What clinicians are saying is that over 75-year-olds who are presenting are more ill than would have been the case prior to Covid.  These are challenges we have to deal with.<\/p> <p>Clinicians are responsible for treatment in terms of prescribing.  That much is clear.  Where there are junior doctors in position, there should be proper clinical oversight in respect of that.  That was not the case from the evidence presented by the independent review of south Kerry CAMHS.  Fundamentally, clinicians have their chain of accountability too in terms of the Medical Council and they are responsible for the prescription policy and the treatment of individuals.  Every individual is different, and every case can be different.<\/p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy raised Covid-19 and the hospitalisation of zero to four-year olds.  I spoke to the Chief Medical Officer this morning.  He is very clear that as far as he is concerned, there has been a stabilisation overall in terms of hospitalisation.  We did not specifically discuss children.  He said the conversion is not there at the moment to ICUs or more generally in terms of hospitalisation.  We are basically where NPHET was hoping to be when we lifted restrictions some weeks ago.  The CMO is reasonably satisfied with the continuing progress we are making in regard to Covid-19.  That will inform NPHET's decisions in terms of advice that it will give to the Government in respect of mask-wearing more generally and in schools.<\/p> <p> I would draw a distinction between public health guidance and advice, and that which is mandatory.  That is an important point.  What has to be assessed is whether there is justification for a legal, mandatory framework, which makes it a legal requirement to wear masks.  That is an issue on which NPHET will advise the Government in the coming days.  The Government will take decisions based on that.  That is the up-to-date position I have received from the Chief Medical Officer.  I will revert to him on the inquiry in respect of children and ask what the position is, as outlined by Deputy Paul Murphy.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Kelly's points, a new plan will be announced on waiting lists.  The short-term plan prior to Christmas had an impact.  It brought down the list by about 6% and then Omicron had its impact in terms of December and January.  It is both a plan for 2022 and a multi-annual plan.  Some &euro;350 million is being provided this year in respect of the plan.  The HSE will be funded to recruit as many staff as it possibly can.  The indications are that it would be realistic to definitely be able to net 5,500 staff for 2022.  If the HSE can do more, it will be provided with funding to do more.<\/p> <p> I take Deputy Kelly's point on HPV screening and vaccination.  Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan raised HPV vaccination for young people with me yesterday.  We are following that up to make sure it is as comprehensive as it can be.  That is a very important piece of work.<\/p> <p> Deputy Barry raised the issue of consultation, which I have dealt with.  There has been consultation right through in respect of Covid-19 and schools.  The Minister for Education has always taken public health advice on board in respect of schools.  She has been very consistent on that principle and will follow that.  She has always engaged with stakeholders in respect of school policies around Covid.  As we saw this morning, we have different perspectives in the House on the issue.<\/p> <p> Deputy McDonald spoke about the rehabilitation unit in the Phoenix Park that is closed.  I will engage with the HSE in regard to that but, again, I do not get involved in operational decisions that the HSE takes in respect of particular facilities.  I presume she has raised the issue with the HSE, and it has stated reasons for doing what it is doing but I will raise the fact that it was raised in the D&aacute;il by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600029#BB00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1645018920,"counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00200"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":282,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[5964\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will next meet.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":283,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[6124\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":284,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[6690\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality last met and will next meet.","asker":"1451","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":285,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[6692\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality is next due to meet.","asker":"1552","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":286,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[6693\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality is next due to meet.","asker":"1511","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":287,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[6694\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality is next due to meet.","asker":"1557","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":288,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[8109\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will next meet.","asker":"1550","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1645018920,"counter":289,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[8388\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600030#CC01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will next meet.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1645018920,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 24, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, including sport, arts and culture, equality, including children and youth affairs, and public services, including matters relating to justice, policing reform and community safety.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee last met on 25 November 2021 and will meet again in the coming weeks.

Many people who have mobility problems or who are in wheelchairs simply cannot access the existing public transport system.  Bus, DART and train services are not suitable for their wheelchairs so they have to rely on essentially voluntary clubs, that is if they exist, such as ACTS, which I brought up with the Taoiseach before and there is a similar organisation in Cork city.  Those door-to-door services essentially have to fundraise themselves.  They get bits of money here and there from this or that Department, but they get no money from the Department of Transport.  People's bus passes, which are no good to them because they cannot use mainstream public transport, do not apply to these door-to-door services so they have to pay quite significant sums of money to access public transport.  The Department of Transport gives no funding whatsoever to these door-to-door services.  That is a lack of equality for people who are particularly impacted by disability.  I think their bus passes should fund their use of these door-to-door transport services rather than relying on voluntary funding.  That is what equality demands.

When he moves around, he is at risk of falling and hurting himself because of co-ordination and balance issues, so he needs assistance and support with that.

Deputy McDonald referred to domestic violence and the violence against women policy.  The publication of the Tusla review will be this week and it is my understanding that the Minister is intent on doing that.   There will be a joint delivery board chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, and it will report to the Cabinet committee that we are discussing right now.<\/p>  <p>  When the Deputy refers to a specific budget, there are staff that deal with this whole area in the social policy division and the funding is there for them to do work on this.  They will be working in other areas as well and that is normal within the Department of the Taoiseach.  Some areas get dealt with and are then concluded, but the funding necessary will be there to carry out the work of the unit within my Department to make sure the timelines, the commitments and the strategy are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is going out again to do further consultation.  I anticipate the strategy will be ready sometime in April.  The Minister wants to talk again to the NGOs and the organisations in respect of the strategy itself.  In terms of the agency and the following meetings we have had, the conclusion is that a specific agency would be the best way to pull the different strands of decision together to enable a comprehensive, cohesive and coherent approach to be taken in providing both policy &ndash; obviously, the Minister will provide the policy - and the wraparound supports and procurement of refuge spaces and places.  There will be full and comprehensive approach, given the need to pull together different strands and different areas of responsibility into one agency.  There is a lot of merit in that, given the issues that have to be addressed, and they need to make progress on that.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, as I said earlier to other Deputies, it is very important that we move on the refuge places issue and that we work with local authorities and local stakeholder groups to progress that.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor met with stakeholders in Carlow.  Again, if proposals can come from Carlow, we will respond in respect of developing refuge places there with the local authority and through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Judge Haughton&rsquo;s final report on the scoping exercise, I recognise the ongoing pain and anguish of the O'Farrell family.  Many Deputies have raised with me the tragic death of Shane and we very deeply sympathise with the family on their loss.  Judge Haughton has been conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane's death.  He furnished an interim report to the then Minister for Justice in November 2019 in which he stated he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature or extent of the documentation they wish to furnish to him and his scoping exercise.  The judge is completely independent in conducting this scoping exercise, so it is not open to me or the Minister to comment on any aspect of the judge&rsquo;s work or the process of compiling the final report.  The Department maintains regular contact with the judge and has assured him that any assistance that he requires to complete his final report will be made available.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that Judge Haughton has most recently sought comments on various sections of his draft report from the parties named in it, including the Department of Justice, and the Department has duly responded to his request.  I also understand that Judge Haughton has been in touch with the O'Farrell family regarding this matter.  Following receipt of a response from all relevant parties, it is understood that Judge Haughton will be in a position to finalise his report.  As I said, the Department of Justice will continue to provide all necessary assistance to the judge.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving the final report.  The process has taken a long time, which we regret, but the judge is doing all he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible.  We will take it from there when that report is published.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised the issue of the Coillte land at Ballymartle.  I said previously in the House that Coillte has a particular mandate right now, and commercial is one part of it in terms of making ends meet.  Personally and policy-wise, I am of the view that we have to move to a situation where all State bodies must lead on climate change.  Afforestation is key to that and the retention of trees is key to that as well.  Deputies have raised the considerable concern of people living in the area to retain what is a very important residential amenity.  The issue will continue to be pursued.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raise the issue of mobility.  There is a review under way at the moment within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The whole mobility allowance issue arose because of an Ombudsman's report back in 2013, when that scheme was taken out and no replacement scheme came in.  There is an issue around the cost of disability report.  All of that is now being considered by an interdepartmental group.  The Deputy made a reasonable point in terms of groups like ACTS, those voluntary organisations which provide door-to-door transport services for people with disabilities.  I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in respect of that and I will also talk to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in terms of what can be done.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy raised the case of Tommy Dickson, who is looking for a full-time SNA.  He has a rare, life-limiting mitochondrial condition, as the Deputy outlined.  Again, I am not clear as to why the NCSE has decided not to allocate but I will raise this issue with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600031#DD00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645019520,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachtas.ie.\r\n\r\nWritten Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645019520,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ag 2 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;sar 3 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2022: Message from Select Committee","time":1645020120,"counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600032#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1645020120,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2022: Vote 37.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600032#LL00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces: Statements","time":1645020120,"counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600032#LL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1645020120,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to engage with Members of the D&aacute;il on matters relating to the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies today.  The establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces was set out in the programme for Government and was a key priority for me as Minister for Defence.  The publication of the commission's report represents the culmination of the work carried out over the past 13 months, and is testament to the considerable efforts of all of those who contributed to its completion.  I would like to put on record my thanks to the chair, Aidan O'Driscoll, and all the members of the commission for their hard work and dedication in producing this substantial report.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2020 the Government authorised the establishment of the commission and agreed its terms of reference and membership.  The terms of reference cover the structures and size of the Defence Forces, defence capabilities, HR policies and strategies, the Reserve Defence Force, governance, high-level command and control in the Defence Forces and pay structures.  The commission has interacted with both the Defence Forces and my Department.  It undertook a process of wide consultation, including receiving nearly 500 public submissions.  It has also met a wide stakeholder group, including organisations such as the European External Action Service, other Departments and public bodies and agencies.  Commission members conducted site visits across a large number of military locations across the country and met more than 1,000 Defence Forces members, the Defence Forces representative associations, veterans' associations; and senior members of the Defence Forces past and present.<\/p>  <p>  This report is wide-ranging, blunt in its assessment, challenging and comprehensive.  It proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland.  The report poses serious questions on defence provision that we as a society must carefully consider.  I hope that this report will foster real debate about the defence that we need as a modern neutral European country.<\/p>  <p>The report encompasses recommendations on high-level command arrangements, Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.  People matters are a key aspect of the report and the sections of the report dealing with these issues are forthright in challenging the current culture within the Defence Forces.  The report dedicates a chapter to an analysis of the security environment and echoes many of the threats identified in the White Paper's assessment a number of years ago.  The commission's report identifies an overarching trend of unpredictability and sets out four interrelated trends in the security environment.  It examines these trends, considers their implications for Ireland and the Defence Forces and notes that in a security environment characterised by volatility and unpredictability, societal and organisational resilience is a critical asset we need to invest in.  Ireland is contributing 567 Defence Forces personnel to nine different missions throughout the world.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the commission was carried out against the backdrop of the defence policy framework as set out in the White Paper of 2015 and the White Paper update of 2019, both of which were developed by joint civil and military teams.  The commission' s report examines the roles carried out by the Defence Forces in the military defence of the State, aid to the civil power, ATCP, maritime and air security, international peace and security and aid to the civil authority, ATCA.  The commission set out its belief that a level of ambition, LOA, for each of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is not currently clearly specified.  The report recommends that specific taskings of the Defence Forces, including those arising from ATCP and ATCA, should be subject to regular review for continued relevance and priority.  Other proposals include the development of a whole-of-government maritime security strategy and a national aviation security strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The commission's report sets out a high level of ambition for the future of the Defence Forces and considers the issue of the overall level of ambition  The report sets out three indicative levels of ambition namely, LOA 1, LOA 2 and LOA 3.  LOA 1 represents current capability, which is aiming to uphold sovereign rights and serve on peace support operations to the same extent as at present.  This would require additional defence funding of about &euro;47 million per annum at full strength.  As the House knows, we certainly are not at full strength at the moment.  LOA 2 represents enhanced capabilities, which would involve building on the current capability to address specific priority gaps in our ability to deal with an assault on Irish sovereignty and to serve in higher intensity peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations overseas.  This would involve a significant defence funding increase of approximately &euro;500 million per annum above current defence spending.  LOA 3 represents a level of conventional capacity, which would involve developing full spectrum defence capabilities to protect Ireland and its people to an extent comparable to similar-sized countries in Europe.  The report sets out costings of about &euro;3 billion per annum for this LOA, based on defence spending in eight comparator countries.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state to the House that this report looks at three levels in monetary terms.  The first is what it would cost to stay as we are today, which is less than one third of the average spend in comparable EU countries.  To move to LOA 2 would mean we would spend roughly half of what those countries spend and to move to LOA 3 would be to move into a similar spending bracket to those eight countries.  The commission's report makes a number of recommendations on capabilities based around these three LOAs.  The commission also calls for the establishment of a capability development planning process through a joint civil and military permanent structure to work on an iterative capability development plan.<\/p>  <p> The commission report has identified the capability requirements for each LOA.  The main recommendations on each are as follows.  For LOA 1, current capabilities would be maintained through renewal and replacement programmes.  LOA 2 would require significantly enhanced capabilities.  This would require an extra 2,000 personnel, including many new personnel in the Naval Service because it is recommending double-crewing for a naval fleet of nine, which is what we have today.  It would also require the development of a primary radar capability; a strategic reach aircraft and two additional medium lift helicopters; additional armoured personnel carriers with a higher level of armour protection and sufficient firepower; and a new air defence system for land forces.  LOA 2 would also require increased military intelligence capabilities and an increase in the special operations forces establishment and capabilities.  The report envisages the creation of an information command that would manage Defence Forces IT services, communications and information, CIS, services, and a new joint cyber command for the Defence Forces with an extra 100 personnel.  This LOA would also require the development of capabilities to deal with hybrid attacks and see an increased focus on green defence, particularly in procurement.  It is important to note that LOA 2 is a significant increase in capability that would take some time to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  If LOA 3 were to be pursued, by 2040 the Army would have a significant mechanised component and units would have organic lift capacity, combat support elements and artillery and cavalry elements fully interoperable to NATO standards.  The Naval Service would have a 12-ship fleet.  The Air Corps would see the development of an air combat and intercept capability and combat helicopters would be required for the special operations force.  Each level of ambition outlined above would require increased defence funding, and we in government must carefully consider the implications of each possible course of action.<\/p> <p> One of the key recommendations on defence force structures involves a unitary command structure with command assigned by the Minister to a new military position of Chief of Defence, or CHOD as it is known internationally.  The CHOD would be the head of the Defence Forces with a joint force commander, or vice CHOD, and three service chiefs in the Army, the Air Corps and the Navy also reporting to the CHOD.  A new strategic headquarters would be established to support the CHOD, including a new civilian head of transformation reporting directly to the CHOD.  The report also recommends the establishment of an office of reserve affairs.  The CHOD would carry out an urgent review of Army structures, assisted by external experts.  The commission recommends that any new structures arising from this review would need to be regionally balanced.<\/p> <p> Other recommendations relating to structures include the Naval Service being renamed the Irish Navy, the Air Corps being renamed the Irish Air Force and the Army Ranger Wing being renamed Ireland's Special Operations Force or IrlSOF, along with the establishment of special operations force air and maritime task groups in Casement aerodrome and Haulbowline naval base.  The commission recognises that arising from these recommendations, the governance and oversight framework of the Minister and the Department of Defence will need to be reviewed to provide effective assurance, oversight and accountability.  This is a key consideration and one which will require interdepartmental discussion, agreement and legal advice.<\/p> <p> The commission carried out a large body of work relating to people as the key strategic resource of the Defence Forces.  This is reflected in Chapter 8, which is by far the largest section of the report.  The people chapter is broken into four separate subsections covering a wide range of issues including but not limited to strategic HR, career progression, culture, morale, training, recruitment and pay structures.  The recommendations on Defence Forces people and human resources are forthright and certainly challenge the status quo.  The commission considers that cultural change is required in the Defence Forces and that a fundamental cultural change process should be undertaken and without that cultural change, it is very clear that the potential of this report will not be realised.  The report recommends that a strategic approach to HR be implemented with the establishment of a strategic HR change leadership team to be led by an externally recruited civilian head of transformation.  The report also recommends the creation of a permanent training establishment and the provision of greater flexibility for managers, within the overall establishment number, to allocate staff across formations and ranks.  The report recommends the redevelopment of promotion systems to ensure that they are open, competitive and entirely merit based.  The approach to recruitment should also be changed, with direct entry, civilianisation and utilisation of members of the Reserve Defence Forces, RDF, as part of the approach to deliver required services.  Increasing female participation in the Defence Forces is essential and the report recommends a target of 35% female participation to be achieved over time.  While that is not an easy task, it is certainly something to aim for.  In terms of work-life balance, the report suggests that urgent reform of the existing work practices is required, including flexible work practices, family friendly initiatives and the introduction of a non-financial labour hours budget.<\/p> <p> The commission found that in broad terms, levels of average turnover are not out of line with other military organisations internationally.  However, there are gaps in specialist areas which have a disproportionate impact on operations.  The commission believes that greater transparency of the wider benefits of membership of the Defence Forces should become a central feature in future recruitment campaigns and that the visibility of the total remuneration package should be increased.  In terms of specialist posts, the commission recommends that there should be increased direct entry with appropriately adjusted training and physical fitness requirements.  Recommendations are also made around affiliation to ICTU and pay structures, particularly for privates in their first three years of service and I intend to follow up on those issues as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> The commission recommends that the RDF be regenerated and revitalised through a new high-level vision, with a regeneration plan to be quickly developed.  The commission is clear that the RDF should be a key aspect of Ireland's defence capabilities and recognises that much work is required to bring the RDF up to its establishment level.  The report recommends a reserve for all three services, with the introduction of an Air Corps reserve and a focus on attracting specialists.  The report suggests that the recruitment process for the RDF should become more efficient and be completely revamped.  The regeneration of the RDF would be facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated office of reserve affairs which would report directly into the CHOD.<\/p> <p> In the area of funding, the report concludes that Ireland is an outlier compared to our peers in western and northern Europe in relation to defence spending and has been for quite some time.  The commission believes that the current level of financial commitment delivers military capabilities which are inadequate for the defence of Ireland and its people from the threats identified in its security environment assessment.  The commission recommends that consideration be given to a step up in funding to Level of Ambition, LOA, 2 in the short term pending a more detailed policy debate and decisions required for higher levels of ambition in the future.<\/p> <p> The commission has highlighted five core areas that it considers must be addressed in a detailed implementation plan on foot of policy decisions relating to the level of ambition and budget.  These are transformational change to modernise the organisational structure, its human resource strategy and practices; reform of high level command and control and the creation of a joint strategic headquarters; revitalising the RDF; reform and restructuring of the three services; and joint capability development.  The commission also recommends, following Government decisions on the recommendations in the report, the appointment of an implementation oversight group with an independent chair, the establishment of an implementation management office and the appointment of an external change management support team.<\/p> <p> The report is a significant body of work running to 224 pages, including appendices.  It contains 69 principal recommendations with many of these having a number of sub recommendations, giving a total of 133 recommendations.  The recommendations are challenging and far-reaching and some on the structure side require significant governance consideration.  There is a requirement for careful consideration of the recommendations which will require interdepartmental consultation and agreement on a number of cross-cutting matters before a proposal can be put forward for Government agreement.  Given the breadth and complexity of certain of the recommendations, a period of four to five months is now required to facilitate appropriate consideration and consultation on the report and to prepare a proposed response and high-level action plan, which the Government can then consider and, I hope, agree.<\/p> <p> I would like to reassure Deputies that this does not mean that all of the commission's recommendations are on hold.  I have heard some commentary to that effect but significant work is already underway and ongoing in a number of areas, which the Commission has referred to in its report.  This work includes the establishment of a capability development planning process through the creation of a permanent civil-military structure; an independent review group established to review dignity and equality issues in the Defence Forces to ensure that the Defence Forces is a safe workplace for all current serving members while also reviewing historical allegations; ongoing procurement of equipment in accordance with the equipment development planning process; management of the Defence estate in accordance with the defence infrastructure plan; direct-entry competitions; and the amendment of legislation relating to the Working Time Directive which, as I have said in this House previously, the Government is absolutely committed to.  Other ongoing work includes an exploration of the opportunities offered by the EU' s Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, to develop Ireland's defence capabilities; liaison with the Ombudsman for Defence Forces to examine and potentially enhance the remit of his office; and progression of the programme for Government commitment to extend provision of private healthcare to all enlisted personnel in the Defence Forces.  I also want to commence discussions with representative bodies on the relationship with ICTU in advance of the new public sector pay discussions getting underway in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>These and other initiatives will continue to be developed during the intervening months.<\/p> <p> I am committed to progressing the work carried out by the commission and seizing this opportunity to develop Defence Forces that are agile and modern, designed not just for today but also for the future.  Matters of national defence have traditionally been supported widely in the Oireachtas and I am eager to hear the views of Deputies today and throughout the course of deliberations on the report to feed into the wider consultative process.<\/p> <p> I genuinely hope that we can create a cross-party consensus on how we respond as an Oireachtas and that it can feed into the recommendations the Minister of State and I can bring to the Government in a few months.  Let us not focus on whether it is two, three or four months.  The important thing is to get this right.  We are talking about fundamentally changing the Defence Forces for the better in the future.  I think that it is a realistic target to bring forward serious recommendations, which will come with significant funding obligations, before the summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600032#LL00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645021320,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to hear Deputies' views on the recently published report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  Since my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Defence, I have had the opportunity to see the work that is undertaken by the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and Civil Defence throughout the country and would like to put on record my appreciation of their service.  We have seen during the Covid crisis the support the Defence Forces have provided to the State from working at vaccination centres to flying samples to Germany for testing.<\/p>  <p>  This report provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to review and refocus defence provision in Ireland.  The establishment of the Commission on the Defence Forces was a key defence aspect of the Programme for Government and of the Government's commitment to the Defence Forces.  The commission was given wide-ranging terms of reference and the length of the report, which runs to over 200 pages, reflects the breadth of subjects covered.  The report covers the main topics of capabilities, structures, staffing, the Reserve and funding.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has outlined the main recommendations under these headings but I will touch on a number of its recommendations and issues.<\/p>  <p>  The report is very ambitious about the level of defence provision the commission believes Ireland requires.  These recommendations would require significant increases in expenditure against competing demands on public funds.  To bring these increases about will require a wide debate about the level of defence provision the public desire, as well as choices around public expenditure.  As the Minister said, it is important that we get consensus on this.  The equipment and personnel increases outlined would enhance our current capabilities.  Any increase in capabilities will require long lead-in times and decisions around where to prioritise.  These decisions on personnel and equipment will fall out of larger strategic decisions on defence provision, what our overarching defence policy will be and how that will inform what capabilities are required, along with the correct structures and staffing.<\/p>  <p>  The report recommends major changes as to how the Defence Forces are currently structured both at high level and in relation to a proposed restructuring of the Army.  It notes that the current structure is out of step with international comparators, particularly in relation to the cohesion between the three services.  The report provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at how our Defence Forces are structured and to make the changes required to provide for an agile and adaptive structure to provide for the most efficient and effective Defence Forces both now and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to structures will require deep analysis, given the importance of civil control of the military and what changes would mean for governance and accountability.  These are areas that will require consultation and consideration before decisions can be made.  The recommendations on staffing are wide-ranging.  Given the volume and range of issues, the report has four separate sections on staffing issues.  The women and men who serve in the Defence Forces are the heart of the Defence Forces.  The commission's proposals seek to make the Defence Forces an employer of choice.  Its recommendations cover areas such as strategic HR, career progression and promotion and training systems for those currently serving, to address issues raised during the commission&rsquo;s consultation with Defence Force members.  The commission also makes recommendations on culture, morale, gender and diversity.  It particularly recommends a fundamental cultural change process.  There have been disturbing reports in the media recently on the culture in the Defence Forces.  The recommendations in this section of the report seek to address these and other issues.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has already started to address this by establishing the independent review into dignity and equality issues in the Defence Forces to ensure that they are a safe workplace for all serving members, while also reviewing historical allegations.  Addressing these cultural issues is a key aspect of modernising the Defence Forces and a key element of this report.<\/p>  <p>  Other elements dealing with the people in the Defence Forces cover important issues of modernising working practices such as family-friendly working and the working time directive.  Again, these recommendations seek to make the Defence Forces a more attractive workplace. <\/p>  <p>  Pay structures are addressed with recommendations on how the total remuneration package is presented and how the wider benefits of a career in the Defence Forces should be highlighted.  While the Government is aware of recruitment and retention issues, it is important to highlight the benefits of joining the Defence Forces and the wider social benefit of the training provided to individuals in their time in the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The commission was specifically tasked with reviewing the Reserve Defence Force.  The report contains some sharp criticism of the current strength levels and how the Reserve is currently utilised.  The recommendations call for a regeneration plan to revitalise the Reserve.  The report argues that this is possible with the establishment of an office of Reserve affairs and commitment at all levels.  The commission calls for the development of revamped and more efficient recruitment processes to address the issue of the long lag time between people applying to join the Reserve and then joining.  This presents an opportunity to revitalise the Reserve and increase its utility to the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p>  <p>  The commission also addressed defence funding.  It collected the comparative data from a number of western and northern European countries of comparable size.  The data clearly highlight the difference in defence spending between Ireland and these comparable countries.  These countries all have their own unique circumstances informing their position on defence provision, born out of their own security environment, historical perspective and funding available.  Any move to comparable defence spending would require a sea change in our thinking on defence provision in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the report presents a challenging and wide-ranging review of current defence provision and where it should move to up to 2040.  As the Minister has stated, it is hoped this report will spark a wider conversation about defence provision in Ireland and what the Irish public considers a required level of ambition should be.  The security environment is assessed as being unpredictable and ever-changing and there is a requirement for Defence Forces that are agile to address this.<\/p>  <p>  Given the wide ranging and significant recommendations in the report, wide consultation will be required both across the Government and with relevant stakeholders.  I look forward to the input of Deputies today in what is a vital topic for Government and the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600034#NN00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1645021320,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the commission for its efforts in producing this report.  While I do not agree with 100% of its contents, it is a timely and comprehensive report.  It outlines a litany of failures under the Minister's watch.  That includes the failure to implement previous reports such as the White Paper on Defence and the high-level implementation plan.  Essentially, the report deals with the legacy of the Minister's failures.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's inability to address the core issues at the heart of the Defence Forces has resulted in the steady and alarming rate of departure from the Defence Forces by its members.  It is now an enduring major crisis.  Retention and recruitment are the primary issues affecting the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces.  This is largely due to years of neglect of matters relating to pay and conditions by the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister's refusal to allow the representative associations of the Defence Forces to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU remains as a key concern to members of the Defence Forces.  The capacity of representative associations such as PDFORRA or the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to input into public sector pay policy, particularly as it relates to the commissions, is crucial for members.  PDFORRA has made it clear that it is prepared to withdraw its legal action on the issue of affiliation to ICTU when the Minister advises that he is prepared to grant the Defence Forces representative groups the right to association.<\/p> <p>That right is enjoyed by members of various defence forces right across Europe.  It would be illogical for the Minister to continue with a policy of withholding permission for PDFORRA to associate with ICTU only to come to some agreement on the steps of a court.  The worst possible outcome for PDFORRA would be for the group to withdraw its court action only for the Minister and Government to then deny permission for the right to associate.  In that case, PDFORRA would not be allowed to enter its case again at any stage.  It is time for the Minister to listen.  It is time to listen to the growing list of independent voices who have now effectively sanctioned the granting of association, which includes the European Committee of Social Rights, ECSR, the Barry review, this commission and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  The granting of associate status can be achieved by the Minister through the powers he has.  With the pay talks coming up there is a real danger failure to act will result in members of the Defence Forces being excluded again.  That must not be allowed to happen.<\/p> <p> I welcome the commission's recommendation there be a removal of the exclusion of the Defence Forces from the working time directive.  Personnel shortages in the Defence Forces mean that serving members are being forced to make up the shortfall.  In real terms, this can mean serving at sea or being on overseas deployments lasting months on a repeated basis.  RACO has continually highlighted we are at serious risk of being unable to fulfil our UN mandate, and that is even with mandatory selection for overseas deployment, something that is leading to huge volumes of burnout.  There has been no attempt to record the hours worked by personnel, which would reveal the true picture, namely, that the current strength of the Defence Forces is much worse than the Minister would concede.  The working time directive needs to be fully implemented without delay.<\/p> <p> The Minister also needs to acknowledge the need to examine the case for the implementation of a specialised instructor's allowance.  A qualified instructor who volunteers for specialised training immediately signs himself or herself on for up to 60 or 70 hours per week for which there is no extra payment.  In the modern world with family and community commitments that is simply not feasible.  Consequently, the Defence Forces are left with a shortage of qualified instructors.  The Minister knows well that 35% of Defence Forces members have less than five years' experience.  The knowledge, skill and learning of experienced personnel and their ability to transfer that to less-experienced colleagues will largely determine the shape and calibre of the Defence Forces for a long time.  I have received, as I am sure the Minister has, reports of the consequences of the skills shortages, such as cancelled training courses, a failure to deliver adequate live-fire exercises and indeed many near misses.  The accumulation of these issues on the morale of the Defence Forces is feeding the exodus of personnel.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposals relating to the Reserve Defence Force.  One proposal that can be fast-tracked relates to the recruitment process.  Too much potential and talent is being lost due to the extended and unnecessary time it takes to process applications.  Employment laws also need to be updated immediately to protect members of the Reserve because there is a wealth of talent, commitment and skill in it that needs to be utilised to its full potential.<\/p> <p> The core of the debate surrounding the role of the Defence Forces centres on the principle of neutrality.  This principled position enjoys the support the overwhelming majority of people.  Many opinion polls have consistently shown support levels for neutrality are in and around 80%.  Ireland as a sovereign nation has accrued considerable prestige and respect based on our neutrality.  Neutrality has gifted our small nation a platform in international affairs that far exceeds the economic, political or military strength of our small island.  It is a platform from which Ireland can meet the expectations of those nation that have invested their faith in our country.  Central to our ability to remain neutral and retain our levels of international prestige and influence is the capacity of our Defence Forces to defend our neutrality from threat.  While we are nominally free from formal involvement in any military alliance, Government support for and participation in PESCO challenged this, and we are yet absolutely and completely militarily dependent on our European neighbours.  The safety of our skies is dependent on an agreement with the British Government that allows the Royal Air Force to provide flight interdiction in specific emergencies.  This agreement embarrasses the Government to the point it appears to have difficulty even acknowledging its existence.<\/p> <p> As an island nation, our seas represent one of our nation's richest and most strategically important assets yet we are again depending on our EU neighbours to provide naval patrols to guarantee the security of our seas, even within our 12-mile zone.  Recent events have exposed our vulnerability of the hybrid nature of modern threats to the State and the human cost of the cyberattack on the HSE has yet to be fully determined.  The continual cancellation of naval patrols, with ten in January alone, is seriously impacting on the ability of the State to disrupt the importation of illegal drugs.  The cost of that is paraded across our TV screens daily.  We remain unable to protect our fisheries.  The debacle over Russia's intention to hold naval drills off our southern coast clearly illustrated the ineffectiveness of Ireland's ability to not only secure seas or indeed our airspace but our inability to secure vital transatlantic data cables and air routes.  The proportion of transatlantic civilian air traffic that passes through our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, is 75%, yet we lack the capacity to secure its safety.<\/p> <p> We need to see the principle of neutrality protected by enshrining it in our Constitution via a referendum.  We need to invest in our Defence Forces to ensure our nation has the capacity to defend its security.  As I have outlined, the first step to securing the establishment number of our Defence Forces is to halt the exodus of key personnel from ranks right across the Defence Forces.  We must also provide the Defence Forces with the means to protect us.  We need the means to secure our skies and indeed our seas.  We need a cybersecurity system that actually works.  We need the capacity to provide the necessary security to reap the potential benefits our coastal waters provide for investment in offshore energy infrastructure.<\/p> <p> How the Government responds to this report will not only reveal its attitude to the members of the Defence Forces but its vision for Ireland's place and standing within the international community for years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600034#NN00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645021920,"counter":311,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; go maith go bhfuil an tuairisc seo foilsithe agus go bhfuil s&iacute; &aacute; pl&eacute; inniu.

In recent times we have seen the Women of Honour and the courage they have had in coming forward to outline the abuse they and others have suffered with the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister is aware of many other allegations of sexual abuse and claims against people still serving in the Defence Forces who abused men, boys and women.  These have not been part of the claims to date, but are separate.  I do not know the veracity of those claims.  I am not an investigating officer, but given the extent of those charges or allegations, most of which are beyond the remit of the review the Minister has set up, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and even the UN should be encouraged to address and investigate them with greater urgency.<\/p> <p> Beyond that, the Defence Forces and the Minister need to learn from other defence forces that have addressed and been open about legacy issues, such as that relating to Lariam.  This was a drug that was poisonous to some people, although for others it did what it was meant to do in addressing malaria.  The regime of using Lariam continued beyond what should have been the case.  When people were warned about it, they continued to use it.<\/p> <p> Members of the Air Corps experienced decades-long exposure to poisons.  While safety regimes may have been addressed, the legacy issue has never been dealt with.  Following years of exposure to those poisons and chemicals, there are clusters of very serious and rare cancers among those who served in the Defence Forces, in particular the Air Corps.  There were also incidences of suicide and other illnesses.  In these cases, it is time to admit the truth, admit the error and not fight every single claim.  This is to make sure those who served, and who are very proud of their service in the Defence Forces and in fact regale us with tales about it, could be people who encourage recruitment and encourage people to stay in.  They feel let down and will not do so because the State is fighting them.  It is not embracing them and looking after their health now that they have been cashiered out, have served their time or are too ill to serve.  They need to be looked after.  People will not join the Defence Forces if they believe they will ignore or forget about them in their time of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600035#OO00200","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645022520,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I will read out a statement from the commission's report:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere is a patriarchal approach [in the Defence Forces] that takes responsibility for lower ranks to the point of disabling them, and is resistant to females and so creates an uncomfortable place for them to work.  This culture is grounded in long outdated social concepts, such as the male being the breadwinner in a family, a creation of male and female roles and linking salary to self\u2010worth. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is 2022, not 1922.  Only last week we discussed the Women of Honour.  These are the very conditions that led to the culture of abuse these women had to suffer.  Abuse and harassment are totally unacceptable in any workplace.  As a society, we must show zero tolerance for it.  The Defence Forces should be no different.  All Defence Forces personnel should be treated equally, with dignity and respect.  I again ask the Minister to engage with the key stakeholders, the Women of Honour group, and create a fit-for-purpose terms of reference that will provide an adequate scope to deal with the issues through a statutory inquiry, not just a review<\/p><p>I will also speak about Cathal Brugha Barracks because it is the only operational military installation in Dublin city.  It is a barracks I know very well.  My father was stationed there for most of his military career.  I previously spoke to the Minister about what it was like to grow up as the son of a soldier, and the conditions, low pay and what we had to endure as a family, despite my father doing very hard and important work.  Things have not changed on that, but I will speak about the barracks on this occasion.  There are many concerns among members of the Defence Forces, following a recent kite-flying exercise by a Minister, on the future and possible relocation of Cathal Brugha Barracks.  A response to a parliamentary question stated that there will be: &quot;an exploratory exercise, the purpose of which is to allow for the identification of all the implications and practicalities of such a possible relocation.&quot;  This exploratory exercise must include the people who currently reside in the barracks and call it home.  As I stated, this barracks is the only operational military installation in Dublin city.  What implications will relocation have on other military operations the Army carries out in the city at present?  Will it lead to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becoming more militarised?  This exercise must also take into consideration that the Military Archives are in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  These archives go back to the formation of the State and even before that.  They are very important to the culture and history of our nation.<\/p><p>I will raise an issue also raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  It relates to the ongoing issue in my area regarding Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel and the overexposure of people in the Air Corps to poisonous and toxic chemicals.  While this report is about moving forward and future recommendations and future planning for the Defence Forces, we cannot shut the door on the past.  We must also look back and help these people who have been failed by the Defence Forces over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600036#PP00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1645022520,"counter":314,"content":"<p>A major body of work has been done by this commission, which is necessary.  I will add my voice to the commendations of the commission for that work.  I will also add my voice to what some of my colleagues have spoken about, which are the legacy issues that still remain and have had a significant impact on certain people's lives.  We talked about chemicals and poisoning in respect of the Air Corps and the outstanding issue relating to Lariam.  This probably continues the long history of this State not putting its hand up, accepting that wrong was done and trying to treat people in a reasonable way, but instead just shutting the doors and trying to defend itself.  That does not serve any purpose for any of us.  It is something that needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  We were all in the Chamber last week dealing with the issue of the Women of Honour.  These are people who bravely came forward to highlight utterly unacceptable and criminal behaviour that should not be part of any entity in any state.  The message went out clearly that this sort of behaviour is utterly unacceptable and needs to be dealt with.  I accept that the Minister and others agree with that, but the fact is, as has been done previously, in an attempt to deal with the issue we did not take those people with us who brought the issue up and who had suffered the abuse.  That is a serious failing.  Even at this stage, there is a requirement to re-engage with all the stakeholders and those women to come up with an investigative mechanism or inquiry that is acceptable to them.  That is absolutely necessary.  As I stated, it is just one of those things we have failed to do in this State.<\/p>  <p>  The commission has put a number of questions regarding the future of the Defence Forces.  It will probably beg wider questions across this House, but we all accept that we need a fit-for-purpose Defence Forces.  We all know about the issue of retention.  I will speak about members of the Defence Forces that I talk to in Dundalk.  I remember one man telling me that he could not advise any young woman or man to join the Army at this point.  He said it just would not make sense as such young people would not be coming in under the same conditions he did.  That is a dreadful thing to be said.  We are all aware that there is a particular issue in respect of those who are just in the door and have only two or three years' service.  We know the ratios need to be looked at in that a serious amount of institutional knowledge has been lost and we do not necessarily have people who could operate in a mentoring or advisory capacity in the necessary hierarchy of the military set-up.  These are the matters we need to address straight out.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brady spoke far more eloquently than me about the fact we need to deal with ICTU affiliations for RACO and PDFORRA and the legal questions that still remain.  I ask the Minister to use the powers he has to deal with this issue.  At the end of the day, the fact is, as in any job, respect is derived from working conditions and pay conditions.<\/p> <p>They are the issues he also brought up in regard to the working time directive and a military that is under severe pressure.  In those cases, people will be overworked, hours will be overlooked and people will have to double-up.  Within that, due diligence that should be done will not be done.  We have had the issues with regard to training exercises being cancelled.  It is frightening if any of this impacts with regard to live-firing, training or whatever else.  <\/p> <p> I recall that many years ago when I was in DCU - I was not the greatest student at that time - there were many Defence Forces personnel there studying computing in particular.  At that point in time, it was a different set-up.  We now have multiple failings.  Much has been said in regard to neutrality being an absolute requirement for this State.  There is a wider question in regard to the military spend, but we need to have the capacity to be a neutral State at this point in time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600036#PP00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645023120,"counter":316,"content":"<p>The Minister previously described this report as a &quot;watershed&quot;.  It certainly is a time for honest and open debate and, I hope and I believe, clear decision-making.<\/p><p>Since the Second World War and the establishment of the principle of Ireland's neutrality, successive Governments have felt that being neutral meant we did not need or, perhaps, want a military with the real capacity to protect our country from foreign aggression.  Throughout those decades, we had many other priorities and calls on our money and we still do.  We raised the flag of neutrality and that shielded us from having to invest in the array of equipment and the capacity that are the hallmarks of a military neutral nation, one that does not depend on others to monitor its airspace or economic waters.  For our own convenience, we have sometimes confused military neutrality with military impotence.  Neutrality is a truly important principle that I believe commands the majority support of our people but we need to define what we mean by it and truly invest in it.  <\/p><p>I join with the Minister and others in thanking the chair and committee members for their outreach work and for producing this document.  It requires us to now give real consideration to all of its recommendations and to make decisions.  The report presents us with a number of options on the future of our Defence Forces.  It describes and presents three levels of ambition.  Ambition level 1 is to continue as we are, acknowledging in doing so that we can no longer pretend, if we invest as is or maintain our capacity as is, that we are able to conduct a meaningful defence of the State against a sustained act of aggression from a conventional military force, as the report suggests, and we would likely need to reduce our commitment to international peace and humanitarian activities.  I genuinely do not believe the majority of Members of this House or the majority of our electorate want us to make that choice.  If we continue as is, we now have to do it with our eyes open to exactly what means.  We have no means of knowing who or what is transiting our skies, territorial waters or economic zone, other than if another nation tells us about it.  That is not being neutral if we are dependent on another nation, however friendly it might be, to tell us who is transiting our skies and seas.  <\/p><p>In my view, the realistic option and the difficult choice presented to all of us in this House and to the Government in particular is to accept ambition level 2 or ambition level 2 with some modifications.  The first priority is the women and men who serve this nation in our Defence Forces.  They are the starting point and the fundamental building block.  They deserve better pay, better working conditions, better accommodation and better equipment.  That is the starting point.  We need to ensure they are valued truly by providing decent wage packets, decent accommodation in which they can house themselves and their families and the appropriate equipment to carry out the roles with which we task them.  Having a content and motivated force, whose voice is effectively represented by its trade union representatives as part of the normal trade union movement and as a fully integrated part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in my view must be our first and most urgent priority.  Unless and until we ensure our soldiers, air crews and sailors are valued and truly appreciated in real and practical terms, not by way of speeches in this House but by money in their pay packets and the accommodation that is worthy of them, everything else we talk about in terms of our Defence Forces will fail.  <\/p><p>I want to look at each branch separately and briefly.  I will start with what is advised for the Army.  We need to protect our troops by replacing the existing APCs with level 4 armoured vehicles, establishing joint cyber defence command and providing 100 additional specialists to manage cyber defence and defence IT.  This is a truly important aspect of the recommendations.  Various committees, including the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, have looked at cyber defence.  We need to protect ourselves from a different type of potential attack into the future.  The report also advises the strengthening of military intelligence capabilities, which means the establishment of a joint military intelligence service and an intelligence school, and the development and renaming of the Army Ranger Wing in line with best international practices.<\/p><p>It is recommended that the Naval Service be renamed the Irish Navy and that, at least, nine modern ships be provided by the end of this decade, with double crews providing a minimum of 220 days each at sea.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will know in the worst of times we provided the four newest vessels, the <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett, <\/i>the <i>L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats, <\/i>the <i>L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw <\/i>and the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce<\/i>.  They are the only really modern vessels we have.  We need to see investment in replacement of our flagship and the type of vessels that will provide the capacity to patrol the most difficult waters of the North Atlantic that are our waters.  <\/p><p>For the Air Corps the report recommends an increased and enlarged fleet of fixed and rotary aircraft, primary radar capacity to ensure that a complete recognised air picture is maintained such that, as I said earlier, we know, rather than be dependent on others to tell us, who is transiting our airspace; the development of anti-drone or counter UAS capacity; and the development of strategic air lift capacity.  Post-Kabul, I tabled a parliamentary question as to whether we can provide air lift capacity, either on our own or in conjunction with others because there is shared capacity across small and medium sized countries.  It certainly is something we should provide.  <\/p><p>In terms of our Reserve Defence Force, it needs to be revitalised and truly integrated into a genuine single Defence Force across all spheres of defence.  In ten minutes, I cannot do anything like justice to this report.  It is a truly comprehensive programme of change that will require considerable support and buy-in from the personnel who compose the Defence Forces, military and civilian, and all of us in this House.  It has been, I know, always easier to fund a new school or a new health centre than it is to fund military equipment.  We need to bring the public with us.<\/p> <p>Perhaps we can now ignite a popular debate about what we, as a nation, want from our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> In past decades, we asked our troops, women and men, to face down armed criminal gangs, to defend this State against armed subversives and to put themselves in harm's way in defence of peace across this globe, from Lebanon to Timor-Leste.  We owe all of them a debt of gratitude.  We can now honour that debt by ensuring a modern and confident Ireland can have modern and confident Defence Forces that are fit for purpose and suitable for our times.  It is over to the Government, in the first instance.  I heard the Minister say the commission's recommendations are not on hold.  However, we cannot simply allow this report to join the litany of other reports that have been carried out.  I believe the Minister when he says he will come back here with concrete proposals to make transformative changes that will give security to the Defence Forces to provide the security that this nation requires and deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600037#QQ00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645023720,"counter":318,"content":"<p>My dad served in the Irish Defence Forces for some 37 years, during which time he served three tours of duty in the Congo in one of the earliest Irish overseas missions.  In 1960, they landed in Lagos in bull's wool uniform and heavy black boots.  They did not have much except for their small arms weapons and very little armour.  They did, however, have their Irish spirit and the ability to get on with everything and everyone, no matter the environment.  I am proud of my father's service.  I am proud that I grew up in the married quarters of a military barracks.  I am also proud of the Defence Forces today, with almost 700 personnel overseas in 13 missions, 12 countries and one on sea.  The Covid emergency has only highlighted their role here today in Ireland in contingency response.  They never fail to front up in any emergency when asked, with their many capabilities including engineering, logistics, transport, cyber and communications, medical, air and maritime.  This is the core of my few words today.  While the core role of the Defence Forces is the defence of the State, its citizens and interests, including our economy, we must never forget their role in national resilience and emergency management.<\/p><p>The Irish Defence Forces have become internationally respected as an impartial peacekeeping force, a force for good in fragile states and in places of conflict.  The commission report highlights a need to invest in military capability to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s security and consideration of the greatest threat to global security, that is, climate change and biodiversity loss.<\/p><p>In April of last year, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I travelled to Killarney National Park following a devastating fire that destroyed species rich habitat, contaminated the water, destabilised carbon rich soils and released CO<sub>2<\/sub>into the atmosphere.  We were grateful to the Irish Air Corps for its support in controlling the fire.  It took a huge effort to bring it under control.  While the Killarney fire was raging, there were also multiple fires taking place in various locations across the country and there simply was not sufficient State or private air cover to deal with them.  Over the past decade, we have witnessed record temperatures, record winter temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather and flooding events, all of which are evidence pointing towards a changing climate.<\/p><p>Later this year, our Department will lead on legislating for marine protected areas to protect biodiversity and habitats around our coasts.  Our climate preparedness should include the consideration of the multipurpose use of our Defence Forces, Navy and Air Corps for enhanced protection of our communities in the face of extreme weather events, wildfires and flooding, and in protecting the biodiversity of our territorial waters and coastal communities in the face of rising sea levels.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  <\/font>From my perspective, every piece of equipment we buy as a State should be dual purpose.  Every troop-carrying helicopter can be used for firefighting and helping communities.  Consider a strategic helicopter with airlift capability to lift our troops to major missions.  The same aircraft can support the Department of Foreign Affairs in disaster relief in places such as Afghanistan but it can also support the HSE.  Our Naval Service has a huge role to play in the future on our coastlines and in our seas, not just in defending the State against a military threat or criminality but in protecting, managing and monitoring our environment, ecology and economy.  Our Army needs field hospitals, emergency bridging and flood relief capabilities.  Our Civil Defence needs to be resourced.  Every Government Department and agency should be consulted in defence and in particular in providing national resilience and contingency capabilities.  We need to broaden our horizons beyond our land borders and into our seas and airspace.<\/p><p>Our Naval Service has performed heroics in the Mediterranean Sea in rescuing migrants, many of whom are fleeing the impacts, direct or indirect, of climate change.  These humanitarian missions will need to continue and our Naval Service needs to be adequately equipped to carry out this vital work safely and effectively.  This work is referenced in terms of strengthening capabilities towards deeper engagement in international peace and humanitarian missions.<\/p><p>I welcome reference in the report to the revitalisation of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  I would like to see a role for the RDF in our collective actions on climate and biodiversity.<\/p><p>The review of the aid to civil power, ATCP, states that ATCP and aid to the civil authority, ATCA, should be subject to regular review for continued relevance and priority.  Section 4.6, dealing with ATCPs, outlines the need for a whole-of-Government needs analysis to highlight trends and predict needs.  Section 6.2 on capability development planning advocates the creation of a civil-military structure to embed capability development.  These recommendations point towards a way forward in integrating this reform process within the Defence Forces with the wider needs of the State and the State&rsquo;s assets, namely our land and water and the important ecosystem services they provide. <\/p><p>While issues of pay and conditions are outside the scope of this report, I, like others, am of the view that in order to build capacity within our Defence Forces and to attract young men and women who might be considering this as a career option it is vital that it is an attractive career option.  I welcome the recommendations regarding gender equality and diversity in the report.<\/p><p>The commission report outlines the current threat and risk environment within the context of the Defence Forces designated roles.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tVersatility, flexibility, and resiliency will be required to adapt to change and to react, learn and recover from predicted as well as unpredicted threats and risks.  Moreover, it places a high value on the ability to collaborate across service branches, government agencies, societal sectors, and\/or national borders. <\/blockquote>  <p>I can think of no more important sphere for such collaboration than in our battle to offset the worst impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss.  In this context I fully support the Minister in his work to raise the capability of our Defence Forces and propose that all future planning should include a collaborative role for the Defence Forces in protecting people, land, sea and all of our natural resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600038#RR00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1645023720,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I must be honest and say that I have not read the report.  I have not had the opportunity to do so.  I will respond in more detail to the very detailed report when I get that opportunity.  There are, however, basic principles I think we can lay down.  I have long questioned the Minister about the issue of pay in the Defence Forces and the work burden that soldiers face.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will be initiating discussions, albeit belatedly, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the establishment of a permanent pay review body that would reflect the unique nature of military service.  Personnel can be called at any time to serve very long hours for the same wage.  We know that pay and conditions have long been issues of contention in the Defence Forces.  If we are going to retain well-trained officers, non-commissioned officers, men and women, in the Defence Forces, we are going to have to pay them the going rate for the job.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to deal urgently with the issues highlighted by the \"Women of Honour\" programme.  Those are serious issues.  It seems that women were brought into the Defence Forces but no adequate plan was put in place to ensure they would not suffer humiliation and worse within those Defence Forces.  That issue is of considerable urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the report and what I have read of it.  I agree that we need to invest.  That is obvious.  However, I think we must decide what to invest and where lie the real challenges that we, as a nation, face.  Is it really likely that the Russians will come in with a conventional army and pick Ireland, a small island off the west coast of Britain, as a launching pad?  It is much more likely they would go into their next-door neighbours.  There are challenges there, to which I will come in a moment.  However, I believe that as an ex-colonised country, as a country which won its freedom and laid out a clear stall, we should look at what the Constitution says about our attitude towards international affairs.  In Article 29.1, \"Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.\"  It goes on, in Article 29.2, to state, \"Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.\"<\/p> <p>The first thing we should do is become much more active at the UN and internationally, pushing that this be the way issues should be resolved between nations and not by the threat of an ever worse war by one side or the other.  The second thing is that there is a growing lobby in this country, which I accept, that favours an EU combined military and foreign policy approach and that that combined approach would also involve the UK, a former EU member state, in close co-operation.  Most EU states are in NATO and have mutual defence pacts.<br\/><br\/>It was interesting that the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, Party reported today that:<\/p><blockquote>\tEU Commission Executive Vice-President ... and Commissioner Thierry Breton have put forward a set of initiatives to enhance integration and competitiveness of the European defence market, reducing EU&rsquo;s dependency in the security and defence areas and protecting it from the new threats.  <\/blockquote> <p>In the <i>EUobserver <\/i>of 25 January, it was reported that the EU was &quot;preparing to boost its naval presence [this corporate EU presence of which, remember, we are part] in the north west Indian Ocean 'to uphold freedom of navigation'...&quot;  The article continued, &quot;The Indian Ocean project was outlined in a 'concept note' by the EU foreign service on 19 January.&quot;  It went on to state:<\/p><blockquote>\t&quot;Member states deploying assets [warships] in the new NWIO [north west Indian Ocean] MAI ... would be a good opportunity&quot; to &quot;enhance the EU's diplomatic influence&quot; there, the foreign service said. <\/blockquote> <p>The EU sees itself as a counterpart to Russia, China and the United States - a military power.  Let us not cod ourselves.  That is very much on the agenda and if we do not see that here, we are blind to what is happening in the real world.<br\/><br\/>I do not have any interest in becoming part of military power blocs.  As a small ex-colonised country, we have always gone a different way with regard to our role in the world.  We have done our bit.  There is this idea that Ireland has stood there and done nothing.  We have done a huge amount in peacekeeping, as the Minister pointed.  We have done it with hard slog on the ground and by people interaction, not by having huge military weapons.  It is well-testified too that Ireland, and Deputy Berry would know much more about this, has the unique record of creating human relations in the countries in which it has operated.  We must, therefore, continue to invest in that and ensure that our soldiers who are sent abroad are well-equipped.<br\/><br\/>We have to invest in cybersecurity because we get rogue actors.  They do not have to move.  We saw that with the HSE.  That should be under the military and we should invest significantly in that.  Of course, we use the military within this country not thinking we will repel some major nation that is going to suddenly start marching down our main streets but against all sorts of rogue actors, natural disasters, coronavirus and so on.  We use them as a support to the garda&iacute; at times, for medical transfers and for ordnance disposal, as naval divers, in fishing protection and drug interdiction and so on.  It is important that we invest in all those things.  Do I want to spend &euro;1 billion per year playing military games as part of a big military Europe?  I would rather spend it on housing and health, and I will nail my colours to the mast on education.  We could make a much better contribution to the world that way than we could by becoming part of some big military bloc with aspirations.  Remember, all these are colonial countries, for instance, Portugal, Spain, France and so on.  It is time we had a big open debate in this Chamber on what our military will do and on where we must invest, and we must invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600038#RR00300","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645024320,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I join with others in thanking the members of the commission for the work they have undertaken.  I want to specifically refer to section 8.4.5.  I have not had a chance to read all of the report but I have engaged with that section with which I would be the most familiar.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, when I was a union organiser, my union joined an organisation called the 24-7 Alliance, which was mostly made up of shift workers.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party were in government and as ever, with their usual regard for workers and workers' rights, they could see that workers' wages were under threat, specifically by the nature of the work they were doing because it was 24 hours per day, seven days a week shift work.  The people who were represented by PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, were not allowed to be members of that association, or that alliance.  They were prohibited from membership and, in fact, at our meetings, we used to put an empty chair at the table to symbolise that.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke at length to members of the Defence Forces at the time.  They felt very vulnerable and voiceless and very much left outside of a process that would have had profound implications for their pay and conditions.  They were not allowed to be part of the alliance, although we knew we had their support.<\/p>  <p>  The alliance continued into the following Government with the Labour Party and Fine Gael because the alliance was, of course, very necessary.  Workers need to come together under the auspices of their trade union to defend themselves, sometimes against their employer and, indeed, sometimes against the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I want to specifically refer to the section where the commission references that while it sees \"no reason ... why full affiliation with ICTU could not be accommodated, it does recognise that there is greater complexity to taking this further ...\"  It goes on to mention \"the absolute requirement for the Defence Forces to fulfil its aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authority roles i.e. to step in, without question ...\"  That is strike-breaking.  That is essentially what that refers to.  That is talking about people going to situations where there is an industrial dispute.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe it is beyond anybody to be able to resolve those issues but I think what the Defence Forces and I would like to hear from the Minister, if possible, is a commitment that they will not be used to break strikes and that through their affiliation with ICTU, they will be respected, their rights as trade union members will be respected and they will not be used in that way.  I do not think it is in any way, shape or form necessary for the Defence Forces to have that fear but that is what is referenced here.  The language does not directly say that is what it is but the Minister and I both know that is what it refers to.  It is the undermining of industrial tributes because other than that, there is no difficulty with them being full members of the ICTU.<\/p>  <p>  When we went in to negotiate pay agreements, however, we were sitting at the table and they were sitting in the next room.  That was as much as they were permitted to be part of the process but they were not part of it; they were outside of the process.  The old principle of trade unionism of nothing about us without us was left at the door because they were not allowed to participate.  I do not believe the Minister has anything to fear from them being allowed to participate.  They should be allowed to fully participate fully.  I note that the Minister said he is not hostile to that.  When he talks about affiliation to the ICTU, however, we need to have a discussion about what exactly that means.  That means the men and women of our Defence Forces will be full trade union members and will act in accordance as trade union members.  It does mean the dereliction of duty.  Ambulance personnel are trade union members who play a vital role, as are nurses and doctors.<\/p>  <p>  All these things can be accommodated but we need to hear a willingness from the Minister that he has a view that the Defence Forces can and should be collectively represented by the union of their choice and affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and all that goes with that.  We need to hear that they will not be used to break strikes and will be allowed to be full members of the trade union and fully participate in that way.  That is what those words mean.  They do not say \"strike-break\" but that is what it means.<\/p>  <p>  I remember when I was growing up, my father used to sing a song.  I will not sing it but the words were, \"The buses are on strike and we can't afford a bike, roll along, army lorries, roll along.\"  That is a small concern but I do not think it is a concern that could not be gotten over.  The focus needs to be on members of the Defence Forces being full and active members of their trade union because, believe me, that is the best hope they have of achieving decent pay and conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600039#SS00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1645024920,"counter":322,"content":"<p>If the Deputy sings the song she mentioned, I will give her a little extra time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600040#TT00100","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1645024920,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I would not do that to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600040#TT00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1645024920,"counter":324,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats welcomes the publication of the report on the Defence Forces, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, by the Commission on the Defence Forces.  The report offers an insight into the current situation in the Defence Forces and offers recommendations that can help the organisation to meet the challenges of the future, while at the same time creating a safe and positive working environment for all Defence Forces personnel.  Since the founding of the State 100 years ago, personnel in Ireland's Defence Forces, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, have defended the economic, political and social freedoms we enjoy.  We tend to forget or shrug off that during the founding years, the Emergency period and the Cold War, members of the Defence Forces prepared for and met any eventuality presented to them by way of domestic or foreign threats.  In partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces have, time and again, protected the State from internal threats and, in more recent decades, the aid to civil power relationship has evolved to take on transnational terrorism, human trafficking and drug interdiction, with joint air and naval maritime defence and security patrols taking place in Ireland's exclusive economic zone.  In addition to their routine defence of State assets and their maritime defence and security operations, the Defence Forces continue to aid civil powers in air ambulance and search and rescue missions in extreme weather and aid local authorities as and when required.<\/p><p>We should never forget that since the founding of the State, members of the Defence Forces have lost their lives and suffered physical or mental injury defending and protecting our freedoms and those of people elsewhere.  I would state the exact figure for how many Defence Forces personnel have lost their lives in domestic service but Ireland has a convenient amnesia around the reality of the stresses and strains put on the personnel and their families from the tasks assigned to them by the Government.  All of that is before we take into consideration Ireland's overseas deployments.  Since 1955, this country has embraced the collective security mechanisms of the United Nations.  Then, as now, the Government understood that Ireland is part of a global community and that a security threat anywhere in the world can affect us.  Since the late 1950s, Ireland has committed its diplomats, aides, members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the remote and far reaches of the globe to deal with a wide range of crisis management issues from natural disasters, the effects of interstate and intrastate conflicts, and poverty.  Through peacekeeping, peacebuilding, peace enforcement and crisis prevention, Ireland's personnel have continuously put their lives on the line to bring stability to conflict regions, ensure the restoration of human rights and allow communities to go safely to work, vote freely and have their children gain an education.<\/p><p>Ireland is proud to be the only nation to have an unbroken record of service to blue helmet peacekeeping going back to 1958.  Since then, Irish peacekeepers have served in more than 40 peacekeeping operations around the world, including Afghanistan, the Balkans, East Timor, Rwanda, the Mediterranean and Lebanon, to name just a few.  Irish Defence Forces personnel have completed more than 70,000 individual tours of overseas duty since 1958.  This service has not been without cost.  To date, 86 members of the Defence Forces have given their lives in the service of peace.  With the evolution of the European Union and its Common Foreign and Security policy and defence policy, Ireland has committed itself to the understanding that it is part of a community, the borders of which stretch from the mid-Atlantic to eastern Europe, the Arctic Circle to north Africa and the Middle East.  The geographical scale of the EU, along with its global interests, has stretched Ireland's defence and security parameters even further.<\/p><p>Over the past two decades, the world has been challenged by increasing threats across the two main strategic paradigms, that is, traditional defence and security, and, in addition, a new strategic challenge involving ambiguous threats in the grey zone.  Ireland has not remained isolated from either the old or emerging threats.  Transnational terrorism, climate change as a threat multiplier, hybrid warfare and the return of geopolitics have demonstrated the new and complex relationship between all three strategic paradigms.  Conflicts in Afghanistan, the Middle East and the Sahara region in central and north Africa and quasi wars and tensions in eastern Europe have created displaced peoples, a breeding ground for criminality and transnational terrorism, human trafficking, and collapsing governance and human rights.  In a collective response, Ireland has deployed personnel to Afghanistan, Chad, Georgia, Mali, the Mediterranean and Syria, to name a few.  In addition, Defence Forces personnel have undertaken expeditions to Libya and Afghanistan.<\/p><p>Rather than praising and showering our armed forces with the admiration and improved conditions they deserve, their members continue to suffer from poor working conditions, discrepancies in pay, reduced ranks and inadequate resources and equipment.  How many times has the State forgotten to book flights home for overseas units?  That is a reminder to them of just how much the State cares.  Instead of complaining, however, they follow orders and get on with it as best they can.  Rather than evolving to meet the challenges of a changing defence and security environment in Ireland, the State has systematically reduced its Defence Forces since the publication of the 1999 White Paper.  After the establishment of a Permanent Defence Force of 10,500-plus and a Reserve Defence Force of 12,500, the reorganisation of 2010 to 2012, combined with the decentralising of long-standing headquarters, sent shock waves through the ranks of the armed forces from which they have not yet recovered.  In the name of austerity, more barracks were closed, units disappeared overnight and corps were reduced to all but a cadre status.  A quantifiable amount of State investment and training of expert specialists was gone with the stroke of a pen.  With a defence budget that is one of the lowest in the world, the missions and deployments kept coming and the remaining ranks were stretched to breaking point.  This was especially noticeable in the smaller corps such as the Naval Service, Air Corps and the ordnance and medical corps, which struggled to meet their daily operational requirements at home while continuing to support overseas missions.  The PDF is now operating at an average of more than 1,000 below its current 9,500 establishment.  The RDF has, in effect, been dismantled, with an establishment of 4,069 and a headcount of 1,622.<\/p><p>Disgruntled, demoralised and combating the rising cost of living, serving and retired personnel, along with their families, began to take to the streets.  The Government and the nation did not seem to care.  Then came the Covid-19 crisis, the cyberattack on the HSE and geopolitical tensions.  The reality of the complexities of 21st century defence and security has begun to hit home.  Defence Forces assets could not be deployed <i>en masse<\/i>for any of those events because they barely exist any more.  Embarrassingly, the Government had to rush the procurement of a PC-12 to bring home Defence Forces personnel stranded on overseas deployment and to carry out Covid-19 logistics operations.  Again, the media report on Royal Air Force assets patrolling and monitoring activities off our maritime and air space rather than the reality faced by our personnel overseas.<\/p><p>Nobody expects the Defence Forces to be poised and ready to tackle a belligerent invader.  That is not the vision we hold for our Defence Forces.  What is expected, however, or rather what we owe the personnel of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who daily put themselves on the line to ensure our freedoms, is our respect, gratitude and an improvement in the conditions in which we ask them to operate.  It is the responsibility of Government to ensure military personnel work in an environment that is safe and free from a culture of fear and secure in the knowledge they will not be stranded overseas.  It is our responsibility as a Parliament to guarantee our Defence Forces are properly funded and resourced to meet the defence and security challenges of the 21st century.<\/p><p>The report makes some insightful and valuable observations, including the need for a more flexible command structure, a veteran support office and transformational change to modernise the organisational culture and its human resources strategy and practices.  The report recommends the immediate establishment of a codified, top-down capacity development planning process through the creation of a permanent civil military structure in order to embed capability deployment within the Department and the Defence Forces.  There is a recommendation for a graduation of levels of ambition and required levels of capability to meet those levels of ambition.  The development of a national maritime security strategy and a national aviation security strategy to go alongside it are advised.  Before the Government approves or implements these recommendations, we must take into consideration the Defence Forces themselves, what personnel think of the report and which recommendations the general staff have made.  We must take into consideration the disruption such changes will cause to some personnel and their families.  Would it be prudent, for example, to undertake an exact capability audit of what is required to, first, bring the Defence Forces up to standard and, second, ensure they are able to move forward and meet the challenges ahead?<\/p><p>The report does not give an insightful overview into retention and recruitment of staff, issues that have a long-term effect on the Defence Forces.  Remuneration and service conditions are key enablers in this area.  Remuneration must reflect extra hours worked and access to normal duty patterns while carrying out routine assignments in other countries.  This is especially true of the requirement for three years of marking time in terms of pay at the beginning of members' career, which needs to be abolished immediately.  Service conditions must ensure personnel are free from bullying, harassment and a culture of fear.  To that end, external expertise must be engaged to improve training and policy development in this area.  The report points out that turnover in the Defence Forces is no higher than in most industries, but it does not take into consideration that hundreds of members are paying thousands to break their contracts and leave.  If retention is not a problem, why are the ranks below the full establishment?  Why were the ranks not refilled during the call-out in the early days of the pandemic?  The lack of respect for personnel has been highlighted in particular by the issues raised by the Women of Honour group.  I do not have enough time to do justice to the plight its members have suffered and continue to suffer.<\/p><p>This situation must end.  The Government can approve spending for new equipment and accommodation and a refit, for instance, of the Curragh Camp, but there needs to be personnel to carry out deployments, fly the aircraft and sail the ships.  Elsewhere, states have taken action to ameliorate the strains on their armed forces and encourage retention.<\/p> <p>Other nations have implemented technical specialist and staff ranks, with civilians filling non-operational roles, and having active reserves to capture trained personnel who leave, rather than losing their skill sets.  They also have forms of university training corps that allow for those with specialist, sought-after skills to join their armed forces in a permanent or reserve capacity.<\/p> <p> In the space of ten minutes I cannot do justice to the amount of insight we can give to this commission report.  There is an obligation on us all to respond and I look forward to working with the Minister in order to do that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600040#TT00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645025520,"counter":326,"content":"<p>First, I want to welcome the publication of the commission&rsquo;s report.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this report.  We called for it to be established by a motion before the D&aacute;il in 2019, when we were in opposition.  It was a key component of our input into the programme for Government, which was agreed by all three parties.  It has the commitment of the Minister and of all of the backbenchers in those three parties.  The publication of the report is a crucial step forward.  I look forward to the Minister's work to consult with others.  I also look forward to him bringing back to Government the response to that report.  It will be keenly observed, both by members of Defence Forces in my constituency, and by the many people in this House who are committed to the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to talk about two areas that I believe the Minister and the Government need to address when responding to the commission&rsquo;s report, the first of which is the issue of pay.  The report states that the issue of pay in the Defence Forces \"does not seem to fully reflect the totality of the remuneration package\" and the commission believes more needs to be done to better communicate what that package is.  The difficulty is that that sentence does not sit with the experiences that I, and many other Members have had, when family members of Defence Forces personnel come to us to talk about pay.  That includes all of the issues around basic pay, allowances and so on.  We talk about pride and respect but you cannot use pride and respect to pay for your shopping, your housing or to support your children&rsquo;s education. <\/p>  <p>  There has been significant change in the way the Defence Forces provide things, for example, housing.  Defence Forces that are more modern believe that this is perhaps not what they should do, particularly for Defence Forces families.  However, we have to respect that this puts an additional cost on those families.  There is the broader issue of housing in the State, which we have to reflect in the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces.  There is obviously a significant issue around different contracts and how different members the Defence Forces with different experiences experience that burden.  The establishment of a pay body to deal with this issue in the Defence Forces is crucial, albeit it should be separate from the broader issues that are addressed in the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  <\/p>  <p>  My second point relates to the issue of military leadership, which is addressed in the commission's report in the creation of new posts for each of the different forces and so on.  We also have to look at the issue of financial control, at what is to be controlled by the Department of Defence and at what is to be controlled by the leadership of the Defence Forces in terms of spending, the ability to spend and the prioritisation within that spend.  Who will be the accountable officer and how will that relationship with the Oireachtas work?  More needs to be done in that area.  I know that the Minister understands that issue.  We need to continue to work on it.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the work of the commission.  Many people were highly sceptical of another commission or another body when this was established.  It has shown a commitment to understanding the challenges the Defence Forces face.  It clearly nails its colours to the mast when it says that the high-level ambitions for Ireland&rsquo;s military capabilities, as they have been set out in the White Paper, are not supported by the resources that have been provided to the Defence Forces.  That is key.  That is one thing this commission has nailed.  As well as this, there is a disconnect between policy, resources and capabilities.  We have to urgently clarify the level of ambition.  That level ambition will be key in how the Government responds.  What is our role in the world?  What is the role of the Defence Forces within our foreign policy? <\/p>  <p>  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made reference to Article 29 of the Constitution.  There are obligations within the Constitution that the Government needs to uphold.  However, there are obviously different views on what our Defence Forces should do.  In my view, international peacekeeping is key.  It provides opportunities for members of the Defence Forces to access skills and training they would not otherwise have, if we had an isolationist approach or if we withdrew in any way from peacekeeping.  I hope that this is underscored in the level of ambition that we set for the Defence Forces.  We also need to look the cost of that.  We need to look at cost of the threats such as those posed by cybersecurity.  We saw what happened with the HSE cyberattack.  We need to make sure that the Defence Forces are capable of aiding this State in preventing cyberattacks.  This is probably now at the coalface of how many rogue governments may try to damage democracies.  I want to see this protection within our level of ambition, as the commission&rsquo;s report calls it.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also the idea of an independent foreign policy.  This State has a proud tradition in this area and we in Fianna F&aacute;il cherish it.  The idea is that Ireland is neutral but that our non-aligned position does not in any way mean that we should resile from calling out aggression, militarisation and so on.  I want to make sure that this independent foreign policy is also contained within the level of ambition for our Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The men and women who serve in the Defence Forces do an incredible job.  Often there are several generations within families that have committed to the Defence Forces.  This State needs to support them on a basic level in pay and conditions.  We need to support them in the level of ambition we have for the Defence Forces as a country.  We need to tie all of that to our ambition for our international foreign policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600041#UU00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1645025520,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I too welcome the publishing of the report on the Commission on the Defence Forces.  It is timely that we have this report before us.  However, it will not be worth anything unless it is properly acted on, resourced and funded.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il called for this commission to be established back in 2019.  It was a key element of our manifesto coming into the February 2020 general election, which is now two years ago.  The highlights that I picked out from the report are the high-level defences, the defence capabilities of our country, the fact that there has been very little investment into the Defence Forces for many decades and the organisation, culture and human resources. <\/p>  <p>  The point that sticks out in my memory is from 2018, when Pope Francis visited Phoenix Park.  Members of the Garda were brought in from all over the country and were billeted in hotels and guest houses in and around Phoenix Park and in north County Dublin.  On the other hand, members of our Defence Forces were bivouacking in little tents, in chalets and in makeshift accommodation in the ditches and hedgerows that surround Phoenix Park.  We all saw in one of the Sunday newspapers at that time a photograph that was published by a family member of one of the soldiers.  It showed where her husband had camped out overnight.  Just a couple of yards away from the camp, there were syringes, bits of tinfoil and drugs paraphernalia.  This is where he had to sleep overnight.  The juxtaposition of how our garda&iacute; were treated that weekend with how members of our Defence Forces were treated spoke volumes in itself.  It was right and just that we called everything to a halt, in order that we could look at how we remunerate these members of our Defence Forces, as well as at all the other pay and conditions that relate to them.<\/p>  <p>  I am from a small village in County Clare called Meelick.  We have a distinction in this area because, beyond the Curragh, we have one of the largest soldier populations in the country.  This is because there was a rural housing scheme, RHO, in County Clare back in the 1980s which saw dozens and dozens of serving soldiers who had been based in Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick coming out to County Clare to rear their families.  That estate is Elton Court.<\/p>  <p>  Over the years, Meelick has seen a most fantastic commitment to this nation.  There are members of these families across generations who are joining the Defence Forces.  When I was going to school in Meelick, many of the kids had fathers who were serving in the Defence Forces.  These were guys like Ken O'Brien, Alec O'Neill and Pat Hayes.  Some of the guys with whom I went to school were also in the Defence Forces, such as Jason Boyce, Stephen Hayes and others like them.  They have been to Chad and to Libya and they have served with pride.  They have worn the Irish uniform and have served with pride time and time again.  They deserve a hell of a lot better.  People tell us that the life of politicians is hard, because we are always on the road and we do not get to see our families.<\/p> <p>We have it damn easy compared to the likes of Jason Boyce and Stephen Hayes, who go out for six or seven months at a time to countries without all the home comforts, leaving their young kids at home.  They are doing it for love of their nation but they get very little pay compared to other sectors.  The real litmus test of this report will be the money that backs it up.  We must properly remunerate these people and ensure that awful situation in the Phoenix Park in 2018 is never again replicated.  We want to know that the husbands and wives who remain at home are receiving a decent wage package while their loved ones risk life and limb on peacekeeping duties in other countries.<\/p> <p> I have the utmost respect for Deputy Berry, who comes from the ranks of our armed forces.  He has an incredible CV beyond the Army as well and has upskilled and added to his CV and skill set.  He is an authority on all things military and defence and we should be guided by his views on these matters as we have this discussion.<\/p> <p> I have some comments on fixed-wing aircraft, particularly trainer jets.  There was guffawing last week when elements of this report circulated in the media and there were suggestions that we might need F-14s or F-15s to protect Irish skies.  I do not think it should be scoffed at so easily.  We do not need a fleet of 15 or 20 fighter jets but we do need a training jet facility and I would suggest Shannon Airport or somewhere in the west of the country for that.

The minds of a certain cohort here at home turned to war games, with a rush of blood to their empty heads from the comfort of the armchair or, indeed, the barstool.  Those furthest from the fighting shout the loudest.  Among these barstool soldiers were those who never raised their voices as the British Army slaughtered unarmed people, including children, on the streets in the North.  Yet, they are the first to lecture the people who survived.  They are still very quiet about the reports of the police ombudsman into collusion.  Beyond the island, those same barstool soldiers have their eyes wide shut to children starving to death in Yemen while billions worth or arms are manufactured, traded, and rained down on the innocent by the complicit and the powerful.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot of money to be made in arms and ammunition.  This rampant capitalism is a war game in itself.  It is a war on people and it is a war on the planet.  This matters to us on this tiny island because when it comes to our Defence Forces and their future, the Government needs to make clear whether it is nudging them towards an EU army and involvement with PESCO, or whether we will be keeping our traditional and valued neutrality.  The people need to know and they have a right to know so I ask the Minister and the Taoiseach to make that clear.  Are we keeping our neutral status or are we not?  Is this what Fine Gael wants?  The Government might get its fancy new war gear and jet fighters but it is a double-edged sword because sooner or later it will be expected to use them.<\/p>  <p>  Given the experiences of the Women of Honour and the kind of culture that suggests, it is not entirely surprising that the Defence Forces are haemorrhaging personnel.  A recommendation of particular interest to me and to my party is that of representative association affiliation with ICTU.  The Government could take this powerful yet simple step immediately and show its concern for members of the forces and their best interests.  Such a move would indicate to the committed members of our forces that, just as they are tasked to mind us, the State is prepared to mind them and their families, because theirs is such a tough job, physically and emotionally.<\/p>  <p>  We live in an unprecedented time of change and the world is facing a crisis in human existence due to climate change.  We already know how wonderful our Defence Forces are in times of crisis.  I know many of them personally because they live in my constituency of north Kildare.  Our primary focus should be on investing in, recruiting and retaining personnel and the people in our Defence Forces.  I welcome that the Minister, the chief of staff of the Defence Forces, the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, and members of representative associations are due to appear at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in the time ahead.

I will quote just one.  They are all like this.  It states, the need \"for the Defence Forces to be trained and equipped to NATO standards\".  It is because they can have further operations in line with NATO.  That is what this is about.<\/p>  <p>  If you listened to the remarks of Deputy Cathal Crowe from Fianna F&aacute;il, criticising the Government for not being hard enough on the Russian military operations in the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, think of how that was spun by the media and by the Government.  We are against all military operations.  We are against the military training exercises by the Russians in the EEZ and out of the EEZ, but we are also against the operations of NATO warships that happen in the EEZ all the time.  I asked the Minister for a list of all those exercises other than Irish exercises within EEZ waters over the past 20 years and he would not give me an answer.  The Minister stated that data have been collated but stated, \"It is not unusual for naval ships or vessels of other States to carry out training exercises within the Irish EEZ or to passage through this area.\"  It is not unusual.  As to which countries, they are NATO countries.  They use Shannon Airport day in, day out.  Over 1 million US troops passed through Shannon Airport.  Who knows how many people were brought back the other way in terms of rendition flights.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal with one particular issue, which is the squadron of jet combat planes.  A single one of these planes, for example, the Saab Gripen, which is mentioned in one of the submissions, costs &euro;75 million apiece and we are talking about buying a squadron of 12 or 24 of those.  One of these planes is the equivalent of a housing estate of 350 houses.  Twelve aeroplanes will not scare off the Russians, the British, the Americans, the Chinese or whoever but 12 new housing estates would make a real impact for thousands of people.  A full squadron of jets would cost &euro;1.8 billion - more than the national children's hospital.  At least the children's hospital will serve a real purpose.  This is simply giving money to armaments companies - dealers of death - for no purpose other than some macho posturing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600043#WW00500","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1645026720,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I was just reading over the debate in January 2003 in the Oireachtas in advance of the Gulf War when then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen, got up and defended what we now know to be an absolute pack of lies told by the US Government, US military intelligence, the British Government and British military intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that did not exist.  Brian Cowen and others said there was a real danger they existed and something had to be done and the consequences of this were absolutely devastating for Iraq.  Weapons of mass destruction that did not exist except in dodgy dossiers and lies told, primarily by the United States and Britain, led to the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people and the devastation of Iraq.  Here we have the Government today doing exactly the same in a completely one-sided assessment of military intelligence provided, primarily by the United States and Britain, about the threat of imminent war from Russia.  There is no critical assessment.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, I think Putin is a thug.  He is a militarist.  He has done horrific things in Chechnya.  The Minister is happy to talk about his threat, but not about the record of the United States, Britain and NATO and what their agenda is.  There is not a word of criticism.<\/p>  <p>  That is why I do not trust this report.  I do not trust the agenda behind it.  I do not trust Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael with our military neutrality because they have trashed it.  They have allowed us to be complicit in the slaughter of innocent people in Iraq with devastating consequences for the Middle East.  I do not trust this.<\/p>  <p>  It is fairly ironic that we are talking about fighter jets, the need to defend ourselves and &euro;500 million extra - or is it &euro;2 billion - which is what NATO wants and which is what the militarists in the European Union want us to do.  They want to go along with that but when it comes to paying the soldiers who might be sent out to die in these situations, the vast majority of them are on less than the average industrial wage.  Moreover, the EU working time directive does not apply to them so that they have to work overtime for free, they do not get the housing they used to get any more and they are affected by the housing crisis and so on.  Why does the Government not pay the soldiers?  If it has so much respect for the Defence Forces, it should pay the soldiers decent money.  It is a joke.  They will have all these new ships and planes and the Government cannot even have the number of Defence Forces personnel that we need because the pay and conditions are so rubbish.  The Government should pay the Defence Forces properly and let them be affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but it should stop trashing Irish military neutrality and actually restore it, and stop signing up with warmongers.  Whether it is NATO, the US or, for that matter, Russia, neutrality means neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600043#WW00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1645026720,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The report's level of ambition option 3 states, \"As part of a national Air Defence Plan, the Air Corps would develop an air combat and intercept capability through the acquisition of a squadron of jet combat aircraft\".

It is a tough read for many of us on this side of the House, including the Minister.  I welcome the Minister's personal endeavours and efforts to rectify many of the wrongs that are cited in this report - pay being part of it - but I must ask the Deputies opposite, when they talk about pay, what are we paying the members of the Defence Forces to do.  Is it to implement social programmes or to defend the country?  I heard earlier Deputy Paul Murphy talking about welfare over warfare.  That is an extremely welcome comment.  I agree with the Deputy but if he lived in Estonia and the welfare system was shut down for three days due to a cyberattack by the Russian Government, what is the use?<\/p> <p>We need to have the systems, resources and attention to be able to keep people safe, to ensure that the housing that is going to built and the social programmes are not going to be manipulated by state and non-state actors.<\/p> <p> I am not relying on dodgy intelligence; I am relying on the intelligence and evidence of state and non-state actors who are clearly putting out their intention by massing troops.  We must be fundamentally honest with ourselves.  The days are gone when we could bury our heads in the sand and say we can be neutral and condemn Putin, and then turn around and condemn countries that are our natural partners and allies.  We must remember the European Union.  I did not interrupt Deputy Barry despite his direct comments to me and what he said to Minister.  We are members of the European Union and we do have allies.  We do not spend time on this globe alone.  We must be serious about our responsibilities.  I accept that 12 fighter jets on their own will not work as a deterrent, but that is why we have to work in partnership.  There are other militarily neutral countries in the European Union that can contribute far more than we do, such as Sweden, Austria and Finland.<\/p> <p> There is a level of ambition in this report that is welcome, and it should be embraced.  I believe it can be embraced by the vast majority of people in this House if we work together.  We must ensure that we have proper systems of redress in the context of pay negotiations as well as proper redress to ensure that the culture and environment in which members of the Defence Forces work is appropriate but, equally, that we have a system whereby we can work with natural allies to ensure that Ireland and its people and interests are protected.  At the moment, when we look at the threats on the very near horizons, be it our sea border or on the eastern flank of the European Union, there are growing state and non-state threats that we have to be fundamentally concerned about.<\/p> <p> The cyberattack on the HSE last summer devastated families throughout this country.  We are talking about upgrading computers and systems in the HSE.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to it earlier when the Taoiseach answered parliamentary questions.  I fundamentally agree with him.  We must make sure that the systems and its computers are safe.  That is not just about downloading antivirus software, it is about working with partners to ensure that we have the intelligence and resources to secure those systems in every way possible.<\/p> <p> When we talk about this report, we are not just talking about individuals or systems; we are talking about the tools required and the manner of using them.  Our Defence Forces have to be properly equipped.  There are ambitions in this report that are far reaching.  I fundamentally believe that they need to be embraced.  I do not believe it is a case of either this or that; we must look at this in terms of the responsibilities of the Government to protect every member of society.  We ensure that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are able to go out on the streets, properly protected and informed.  We ensure that they have a relationship with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Metropolitan Police Service and police services across the European Union in order that they can work to counter criminal activity.  It is the same with the Defence Forces.  We must work in partnerships that suit us, but we have to be able to bring something to the table.  We have great resources in the State.  We have great experience in terms of counterterrorism work and building technological systems across the public and private sectors.  We have something to bring, but at the moment when we speak to European colleagues, we are not bringing enough in terms of collective responsibility.  That is not talking about the myth of a European army or the over-militarisation of the war machine that is the EU; rather, it is the quite simple basic responsibility of every government in any functioning western democracy to ensure its people in the state and around the world are kept safe.<\/p> <p> I welcome this report.  The Minister can rely on my support not just on soft points.  I urge him, as I have before and as I will continue to do, to embrace it and to work with partners across the political realm, in the public sector and in the private sector, but most importantly with the current and former serving members of the Defence Forces to ensure that those Defence Forces are that is fit for purpose, not just for today but for the next ten to 20 years.  I look forward to having many more opportunities in this Chamber and beyond to bring about the full implementation of the recommendations in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600043#WW01700","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645027320,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Defence Forces and this report.  I come from Kilkenny city, where James Stephens Barracks is located and where the oldest unit in the Defence Forces, The Bloods, are stationed.  I know the value of having the barracks in the constituency.  I also know the loyalty and support that family members give to members of the Defence Forces in the context of carrying out their duties.  I have heard many debates in this House on the Defence Forces and improving their lot, as it were.  They ranged in time from leading objections to the closure of barracks, and ensuring that the barracks in Kilkenny remained open.  Every so often, an attempt would be made to reconfigure the armed forces and to reconfigure the location of barracks, but Kilkenny always survived.  During the course of those debates, the issue of pay arose.  I would love to see any effort to improve the Defence Forces, starting with the personnel and their wages.  A significant amount of work needs to be done to improve the human resource element of the Defence Forces and its management.  I want to see the members of the Defence Forces being paid a lot more.  I also want to see an end to the contracts.  Any restructuring of the command in the Defence Forces must be structured in a way that acknowledge fully the role of the soldiers as they enlist and proceed in their career in a legitimate and transparent way through the ranks of the Army.  To my mind, that does not happen at present.  We need to make it happen.<\/p>  <p>  I call for an investment in personnel and in the existing barracks around the country.  A significant investment is needed in Kilkenny Barracks.  The waters are muddied in terms of investments in barracks when we hear about the barracks in Dublin being investigated for the provision of houses.  We must get our facts right about that.  That sends out messages to barracks in other locations and gives rise to the question of whether they are next.  We must be clear about this.  We have barracks such as the one in Kilkenny that are established and well run.  They are part of the history and the delivery of services through the armed forces.  They have been part of our missions abroad, which built up the reputation and respect Army personnel have both at home and abroad.  We need to state clearly our intentions regarding the barracks and the investment that will happen in the coming years.  We must also be clear about the improvements that we expect from the ground up and we must ensure that those that are recruited are paid and that they have a pathway to a very positive career ahead of them.<\/p>  <p>  My experience of dealing with the soldiers who are based locally, who I come across in my constituency work, is that they love the job and they are proud of their uniform, yet they feel there is not the level of respect that should be there.  That level of respect can come about in many ways.  If you respect the personnel within your business unit, you will pay them.  I would like to see the pay increase being the first change the Minister will implement.  The career pathways in the Army must be open to all of the new aspects of defending a country such as cybersecurity.  We must examine that and ensure that the Defence Forces are properly funded and that the personnel are properly paid for what they do.<\/p> <p> I would also like to see better organisation for retired soldiers, the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, and those who represented our country in the past.  I believe they are badly treated.  I meet them on occasion and I know of the fundraising they have to do to ensure that those who are retired and in need of housing or financial support are given that support.  If we are to be proud of our Defence Forces generally, we should ensure they are looked after in their retirement.  It is similar with those who are ex-Army and who are now participating in independent groups that are presenting the past to us in all of these celebrations, such as Kevin McCormack, who is an activist in this area.  They put on great shows of support for the Army by way of the old uniforms, old vehicles and so on.  There is a lot that can be done to improve morale within the forces.  Those steps should be taken first before any other major investment is put in place.<\/p> <p> I want to mention the women the Minister met.  Issues like that have to be dealt with immediately, with no holding back - you take the issue, you deal with it and you act honourably.  I am not saying the Minister did not do so.  I am saying that he would act honourably in terms of dealing with the situation.<\/p> <p> I spoke to Donal and Liz Jevens today.  Cadet David Jevens died as a member of the Air Corps.  His parents are seeking the truth in respect of that accident.  I ask the Minister to respond to them, given that the Garda and the Commissioner are now involved.  They would welcome a more open and transparent way of dealing with their case.  As I said, the Commissioner is involved.  I urge the Minister to take an interest in what the Commissioner is doing and respond accordingly to the family.<\/p> <p> I support any initiative that will improve the Defence Forces and their conditions and that pathway to a greater career.  I urge the Minister to start immediately in seeking the funds to ensure that all of this will happen sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600044#XX00200","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645027920,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I welcome the report despite it being further evidence of the failure of successive Governments to address our country's defence needs.  The immediate priority for the Government must be to address the exodus of personnel which is challenging the capacity of the Defence Forces to carry out their current responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  I visited the Curragh Camp last week and witnessed at first-hand the absolute state of the place.  It has been allowed to decay so much that the soldiers who have been in Lebanon must be very at home when they come back.  I do not know how anyone works there.  A once vibrant barracks and community have been left to rot.  It is because of gross mismanagement by successive Governments that it is in this state.  It is disgraceful.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking of mismanagement, I must raise again the dumping at the hollow next to Donnelly&rsquo;s Hollow in the Curragh.  Somebody from the Department of Defence thought it would be a great idea to carry out large-scale dumping in such an important area for the biodiversity of our county.  It seems we will never know who made this decision because the system closed ranks to protect the wrongdoer.  Where have we heard this before?  The secret deal done in mediation must be exposed.  Have we not moved on from this carry-on that used to happen regularly decades ago?<\/p>  <p>  The old Curragh post office is left to decay into rack and ruin.  The last hope for the future, the Curragh post-primary school, instead of being expanded is being moved out of the area to Kildare town.  There is plenty of capacity in both areas and I urge the Government to reconsider this decision.<\/p>  <p>  The report recommends the granting of approval for affiliation to ICTU and the Government must do this without delay.  This would send an important message to Defence Forces personnel that there is a willingness to take the necessary steps to address the haemorrhaging of staff.  Many Defence Forces personnel have a proud tradition of service but the Minister and I both know that pride cannot pay their bills.<\/p>  <p>  It must also be categorically stated that the principle of Irish neutrality is central to any discussion surrounding the role of the Defence Forces and we must question the direction which the Government appears to be leading the Defence Forces, which is towards full participation in PESCO and an EU army.  Any discussions around Ireland's security needs must take place with a clear understanding that we are and intend to remain a neutral country, and investment in our Defence Forces must be to allow us to remain militarily neutral - in fact, not just in name.<\/p>  <p>  The report advocates a &euro;2 billion annual increase in defence spending.  Instead of spending it on defence, we could make huge progress with housing.  With an extra &euro;2 billion, we could deliver 12,000 real social homes, 4,000 affordable rental homes and 4,000 affordable purchase homes, and still have enough money to reduce rents by introducing a refundable tax credit, put one month&rsquo;s rent back into renters&rsquo; pockets and introduce a ban on rent increases for three years.  The reason I say this is that soldiers are citizens too and they need housing.  We could improve our health service.  An extra &euro;2 billion could deliver 932 additional beds, including 248 specialist community beds across mental health, addiction recovery and palliative care.  We would still have money left over to recruit more than 6,250 additional staff, including consultants, nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists and physios.  We could reduce the cost of healthcare by expanding GP card eligibility for carers and children, cutting the cost of prescriptions and phasing out hospital parking and inpatient charges, and we would still have money left over to phase in free GP care.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I am stating all of this is that the Minister and I both know politics is about choices.  Yes, our Defence Forces need investment but this should be around ensuring it is a good place to work, ensuring that working conditions are sufficient for a modern defence force and ensuring it is fit for purpose.  It should not be about bringing us up to PESCO level or NATO level.  The first step must be to improve the basic pay of Defence Forces personnel, 20% of whom are on wages so low that they are in receipt of working family payment.  By all means increase military spending to ensure the working conditions and equipment are fit for purpose, but not to involve ourselves in military action to which we should not be a party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600045#YY00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1645027920,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their detailed opening statements.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I very much welcome the publication of the report.  I join with other Deputies in commending the 16 commissioners for their hard work over the past 13 or 14 months.  They delivered the report pretty much on time, despite the Covid pandemic.  I would also like to thank every single Deputy and every single party in this House.  Long before I became a Member of this House, I used to track the debates and it was obvious there was a lot of common ground when it comes to the defensive perspective.  Every single party here is very much in favour of our troops from a pay, housing and healthcare point of view, and that has not gone unnoticed.<\/p>  <p>  The third group of people I would like to thank is the wider Defence Forces community for their support in recent years - everybody from those involved in the Respect and Loyalty parades to the wives and partners of the Defence Forces.  Much of what they were advocating for is contained in this report.  I hope they can recognise their fingerprints on this report when they read it over time, because a lot of what they asked for is already here.<\/p>  <p>  We have a very good blueprint.  It is a blueprint to restore the spirit of the Defence Forces to the once proud organisation it was, even just ten years ago, but it must be implemented.  What the report has achieved, even already, is that it is now possible to have a normal civilised, courteous, rational debate and discussion on defence and security matters, just like other countries that exist around the world.<\/p>  <p>  I have five points to make.  The first relates to levels of ambition, LOAs.  The report is quite clear in that it practically compares the Defence Forces to this country&rsquo;s Swiss army knife, which is very important.  There is massive utility in our armed forces.  As they displayed quite effectively during the Covid pandemic, there is no end to the skills and talents on display.  They can orientate themselves to any threat, whether it is a biological pandemic, a severe weather event or a security event.  It identifies three levels of ambition, as the Minister outlined.  A good comparison is an insurance policy.  Defence forces are not just needed in times of conflict; they are also needed in times of peace in order to provide national resilience.<\/p> <p> If Ireland was a car, LOA 1 would be the equivalent of third party-only insurance, LOA 2 would third-party fire and theft insurance and LOA 3 would be a comprehensive insurance policy.  One of the key findings of the report is that we have not even reached LOA 1 yet; it is stating that Ireland does not have an insurance policy.  If Ireland was a car, I would say that not only we do not have an insurance policy, we do not even have motor tax or an NCT.  We have bald tyres and the single driver who is in charge of the vehicle is utterly demoralised and exhausted.  Those are the key takeaway points for me.<\/p> <p> The second issue I would like to raise is capability development.  This report is all about capability development from a land, sea, air and cyber point of view.  We will start with the maritime.  Only in the past two or three years have we begun to realise that our maritime area of responsibility is about eight times larger than our jurisdiction.  There has been an awakening to that, particularly from the point of view of offshore wind energy generation.  We need an effective navy for a number of reasons.  First, from a search and rescue point of view, our fishers, trawlers and commercial transport ships need to be rescued in times of great crisis.  A search and rescue capability is imperative in that regard.  Second, we need a deterrent from a smuggling point of view.  We know that vulnerable people are being trafficked into this country, that fugitives can come and go as they please and that weapons and drugs are being brought in.  In the past 12 months alone, two submarines full of drugs were found in Spain.  Those vessels came across the Atlantic from the Amazon.  We have no way of detecting whether there are submarines in our maritime area of responsibility.  The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.<\/p> <p> I was not going to touch on the air perspective but it has been the subject of much public commentary and has been mentioned this evening.  It is a peripheral part of the report but the main driver to increase our air policing capability is not the Defence Forces, although they are in favour of it.  If one reads its submission, one will see that the Irish Aviation Authority was the main driver because it recognises that being able to have a recognised air picture is really important from a flight safety point of view.  We do not have any primary military grade radar and we are the only one of 27 EU countries that does not have that capability.  We need to be able to identify aircraft in our airspace that do not have transponders.  We know that drugs are being flown in here late at night to small airstrips but we have no way of detecting the planes carrying them.<\/p> <p> The air intercept capability is aspirational for 2040.  It is only an option for consideration.  The report is right to mention it.  It is important to say that those involved are not looking to create this service but, rather, to re-establish it.  We had this service in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, when the country was much poorer than it is now.  The report looks at considering re-establishing it.  Again, this is about flight safety.  Only last week in a different country, a commercial airliner lost communications and immediately supersonic aircraft were scrambled and vectored to the location to eyeball the cockpit and confirm that the pilots were awake and could re-establish communications and that the aircraft had not been hijacked.  That is important from a flight safety point of view.<\/p> <p> I like what Deputy Brady mentioned earlier on about the access the Royal Air Force has been granted to Irish airspace in extreme situations.  That was brought 20 years ago in the aftermath of 9\/11 in just such an emergency, and I can totally understand the context of that.  I am not sure what the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that would be but 20 years on it is probably time we had a debate on that matter.  We have shown tonight that we can have a mature conversation about these things now.  If we require an air policing service the logical question is whether we should provide it ourselves or if we should ask another country to do so.  My preference is that we would provide it for ourselves because I am in favour of us becoming a neutral country and not relying on other people.  That matter is worthy of debate, perhaps between now and the summer recess.  Such a debate would be useful.<\/p> <p> I refer to land capability development.  This is about increasing our intelligence capability and again this is all about people.  Deputy Boyd Barrett said it is important that we have independent analysis capability and that we are not relying on other countries.  An intelligence capability would give us that early warning to prevent incidents happening.  Special forces capability needs to be improved so we can intervene before an incident happens.  Cybersecurity is essential.  We have seen the effects of the HSE cyberattack last summer, which were devastating.  It is important that we have a resilient, organised and hardened cybersecurity service to make sure the country is properly protected.<\/p> <p> People are essential and the report mentions this.  A rifle is only as good as the soldier behind it and a plane is only as good as its pilot.  As a mariner, the Minister will be aware that a ship is only as good as its crew.  We really have to address the personnel issue in our Defence Forces and there is virtual unanimity in the Chamber on that.  The pay problem needs to be resolved.  Removing the prohibition on Defence Forces representative associations to affiliate with ICTU is a good start.  I was hoping that might be announced today but I appreciate that it is appropriate that the representative associations get the courtesy of consultation in advance of that.  I understand that should be forthcoming in the next while.  The reason the Defence Forces are the poorest-paid public servants is they have been locked out of the pay talks for the past 30 years because they have not been allowed to affiliate with ICTU.  I accept that they get the general round increases like every other public servant, but they do not have access to the chairman&rsquo;s notes or to the lucrative side deals that other sectors get.  Over a 30-year period a significant gap has opened between military and normal pay in the country.  With the pay talks coming up at the end of this year I would like to think that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have an empathetic and sympathetic ear when it comes to redressing that injustice that has occurred over the last 30 years.<\/p> <p> My constituency colleague, Deputy Patricia Ryan, mentioned housing and I agree entirely with what she said in her contribution.  We can do more from a housing and accommodation perspective from a Defence Forces point of view.  We have a housing crisis and it is appropriate that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is in the lead but other Departments can support and assist.  We know that we can build houses on the Curragh or in Baldonnel without planning permission because it is military property for military families.  I would be grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that because one of the submissions from the commission was from the Wives &amp;amp; Partners of the Defence Forces and it proposed establishing an approved housing body, AHB, within the military.  There are dozens of them already but an AHB could be established to take over military accommodation, manage it properly and even draw down funds from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to build more housing and accommodation on the Curragh or in Baldonnel, where there is plenty of space.<\/p> <p> I want to make a point about cost.  It has been mentioned that the recommended LOA is to increase the budget by &euro;500 million, which is a big sum.  I would argue and contend that the cost of doing nothing would be far more.  The cost of the HSE cyberattack, which was only a single attack, is &euro;100 million and rising.  One can imagine if we had multiple attacks like that over the course of a year.  The key thing is to get ahead of these attacks and prevent them from happening in the first place.  Following on from that, the report mentions that we should acquire two new helicopters.  It is important that these helicopters would be dual purpose and not exclusively be used for a core military function.  For instance, at the moment the Air Corps helicopters are providing an air ambulance service and are completely integrated into the health service.  They are also providing an air fire brigade service because whenever there is a bush fire or forest fire they are deployed there.  They are used for mountain rescue as well.  There is dual technology in these helicopters so an investment is not just being made in the Defence Forces but in national resilience as well.<\/p> <p> The report will prove worthless unless it is implemented.  I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate if he has somebody in mind to be the independent chair of the implementation body.  When are we likely to know who that person is?  We discussed this matter at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence yesterday and we agreed that the committee is at the Minister&rsquo;s disposal if he wishes and if he thinks it could make a useful contribution on implementation.  For instance we could bring in the implementation body every quarter or six months for an update to make sure we drive home implementation.<\/p> <p> I welcome the report.  It is a great vehicle for change and progress and I want to emphasise that there is an enthusiasm and willingness for change on behalf of the defence community.  There is also an expectation for change and we can deliver that.<\/p> <p>If we do not implement this report, the Defence Forces will collapse.  That said, I agree with the phrase that every good builder uses, which is that rock bottom is the best foundation.  We cannot get any lower than this and the only way from here is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600045#YY00300","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645029120,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the authors of this report for their thoroughly comprehensive body of work and recommendations.  The report sets out, in very clear manner, the current state of our Defence Forces and points to various paths that lie ahead for the future of the military, depending on how we in this House and as a society react to the analysis and the warnings contained therein.<\/p>  <p>  We must implement systemic changes within the Defence Forces and the kind of changes required will impact on every aspect of the work they do.  Members of the Defence Forces are professionals and are dedicated to the cause of the protection of the nation.  However, for too long they have been left without the resources they need to grow and develop into a modern military service.  As a result, and as demonstrated in this report, we now have a force that is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we must make continued investment in our Defence Forces across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  Crumbling barracks, aging equipment and deteriorating vehicles limit the ability of our military to respond to an emergency at home or abroad and limit the potential of the professionals working within the service.  As I have mentioned in this House many times, we must also be aware of the urgent need for primary radar to be in operation, something that is long overdue.  This has been mentioned by several Deputies today.<\/p>  <p>  We need real reforms from the Government and the Defence Forces themselves to tackle the issue of morale.  This will require improvements to pay and conditions, long term investment and importantly, clear career development pathways.  Without these reforms we will continue to see the loss of our best and brightest whose expertise will not be easily replaced.  The Defence Forces must also change from within.  Increasing diversity across the three arms of the service will benefit the entirety of the force.  It is also vital that the masculine culture identified in the commission's report is changed utterly and that a culture of gender equality is rapidly developed.  This is among the most pressing actions within the report, in my view, and one which the Defence Forces can begin in the short time ahead.  As we have seen in recent weeks and as women have known since their early years, Ireland has a long road to travel with regard to gender equality and eliminating casual, everyday sexism from within our society.  To tackle this issue we cannot accept that it can be done sector by sector.  It must be done across the board in every home, business and organisation in Ireland and it must begin today.  Just as our society has changed over time, so too must the arms of the State change and reflect the modern society we are continually striving to become.<\/p>  <p>  As one part of the solution, a robust and effective complaints mechanism for personnel must be put in place.  The current situation has given rise to fears of reprisals or of complaints negatively impacting on an individual's career progression.  This is neither healthy nor sustainable.  A gendered system is present within the military and it must change.  This has been driven by a lack of appropriate equipment for female members, inappropriate fitness regimes and an overall patriarchal approach, as identified within the report.  As a result, women make up just 7% of the Defence Forces and while I welcome the target of increasing this number to 35%, such an ambitious increase must be backed by clarity of mission and resourcing.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most significant aspects of national security to which we must pay particular attention is the spectre of cyberwarfare.  We live in a world that is no longer bound by conventional weapons or geographic borders.  An adversary at home or abroad can strike at the heart of the nation's infrastructure from anywhere in the world and wreak havoc on the functions of the State.  This is an increasingly common weapon used by criminal groups and rogue states that we cannot ignore.  We simply have not invested enough resources or skills into building a comprehensive cybersecurity network.  We have seen in our own country, in the aftermath of the HSE cyberattack, the damaging knock-on effects an attack can have.  In the last few weeks we have seen significant cyberattacks on the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian banks, the Portuguese Vodafone service and the International Red Cross.  The reality is that these attacks are happening all of the time, all over the world.  The enhancement of our cybersecurity infrastructure is an essential investment in our future because cyberattacks have the ability to cripple the nation.<\/p>  <p>  It is very clear that we do not want a Defence Forces that is neglected or under-resourced and that cannot adequately protect our citizens.  We do not want a force of women and men who do not adequately reflect the diverse society we have now become.  We must invest in our women and men in uniform and provide them with the tools to complete their mission, wherever and whatever that might be.  I very much look forward to the comprehensive evaluation of this report being presented to these Houses in the autumn for further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600047#AAA00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1645029120,"counter":367,"content":"<p>It is time for a massive programme of reform of the Defence Forces.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in opposition, we called for the establishment of a commission on defence in a motion passed by the D&aacute;il in 2019 and this was an election manifesto commitment for us in 2020 because we knew that there was no clear strategy on what we want for our Defence Forces or on how to fund them correctly.<\/p>  <p>  We know there are massive issues with pay.  The family of a Defence Forces employee came to my clinic seeking housing support recently.  The family was in receipt of family income support because their income was so low.  We also know there are workplace issues relating to discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct in the Defence Forces.  We acknowledge the Women of Honour and their bravery, courage and commitment in telling of their experiences in a public arena in order to bring about change.  We must listen to them.  There must be a safe working environment for members of the Defence Forces and that means change.  Now that we have this report, we must act to bring about fundamental change.<\/p>  <p>  There is a retention and recruitment crisis, a resource crisis and a pay crisis in the Defence Forces.  We spend less than most other European countries on defence and we need to change that.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is seeking the view of other key stakeholders on the change that is needed.  I look forward to the high-level action plan which I understand will be published this summer.  We need to see the establishment of a permanent pay review body.  This is a really serious issue.  I welcome this report because it gives us the space for a conversation about the defence that we need as a modern European country, including the training required for same.  There is a disconnect between State policy and resources and we need to change that and to use common sense here.  If we are to be ambitious then we must match that with resources.  We must pay our Defence Forces properly and ensure the best working environment possible.  Action is needed and it must be swift.<\/p>  <p>  I want to compliment the soldiers based in Kilkenny barracks who do an excellent job.  They are proud to be working there and proud to be representing their country but we must support them and their families, whether that is with housing or in other areas.  We need to support them.  I know a lot of members of the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, in Carlow and urge the Department to ensure that our retired soldiers get adequate support too.  The Cathaoirleach of Carlow County Council sent a motion to the Minister about service medals for members of the 35th Infantry Battalion who bravely served during the siege of Jadotville.  Former soldiers were denied their service medals.  Carlow County Council sent a motion to the Minister but they have still been denied their medals.  We must be mindful and respectful of our soldiers and our Defence Forces personnel.  We must listen to them and work with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600047#AAA00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1645029120,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the commission for such a comprehensive report.  Casement aerodrome in Baldonnel is in my constituency and from there women and men protect and defend our island nation and carry out life-saving missions.  They provide assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Civil Defence Ireland in search and rescue missions.  They provide support to the HSE in providing urgent medical care.  They assist our county councils in dealing with natural disasters like storms and gorse fires, including in Northern Ireland.  During Covid, our Defence Forces were there when we needed their help, whether that was with vaccine administration or the delivery of PPE and vaccines.  What our servicemen and servicewomen do is incredible and they deserve our full gratitude and support.<\/p> <p>That is why the Minister's mission to radically reform our Defence Forces is so welcome.  It is clear how seriously that reform is being taken when we see the scope, breadth and detail of the report having considered more than 500 submissions and so many site visits carried out.  Overall the report is very ambitious.  It seeks significant increases in funding.  That is a conversation that I welcome and one that we must have.<\/p> <p> The report sets out three scenarios or ambition levels for consideration.  A common thread is the desire to increase personnel and equipment so that we can bolster our forces.  These need to be examined in the context of our overarching defence strategy and the constraints of our national budgets.<\/p> <p> The public was quite concerned by headlines that said Ireland was inadequately equipped to defend itself should it need to.  Without the report and this information we cannot do anything about that because knowledge is power.  Therefore, I welcome the light the report sheds on the matter.  People are our greatest key strategic resource.  We need to ensure the Defence Forces is an attractive career as well as a safe, diverse and an inclusive workplace.  Much has been said recently about the culture in the Defence Forces.  That culture is threaded throughout the report.  I know that it is something that the Minister is committed to modernising.  One recommendation that I was particularly interested in was the target of 35% female participation.  Prior to Covid I had the pleasure of attending an Air Corps women's network event where I had the opportunity to meet many of the service women, and indeed servicemen, who are based in Baldonnel who play a crucial role in supporting communities across the island.  I heard first-hand their pitch for how we can make the Air Corps a more attractive career to young people and especially young women and what the Minister can do to support women who take on this career.  Their gender should not be a barrier for them.  I know the Minister agrees with me on that.  At that event we also heard from Lieutenant General Se&aacute;n Clancy, who was then brigadier general, who is now Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  I wish him the very best in his role.  I ask him to continue to bring his focus on diversity and inclusion within the force to the fore.<\/p> <p> I thank all members of every arm of our Defence Forces for their service to our nation, including those who work in my constituency in Baldonnel.  I understand it may be rebranded as the Irish airforce.  However uncomfortable or troubling, some of the findings in the report may be, I welcome the knowledge and recommendations it gives us.  They are recommendations which we can act on to further improve the Irish Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600047#AAA00400","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645029720,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I note that the Minister is not present in the Chamber for the remainder of this debate.  That is an observation which no doubt serving members and veterans, and their spouses and children will note with some interest given that it is the second time in as many weeks that the Minister has not been here for a debate on the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  Commandant Conor King, the general secretary of RACO has said that without significant retention initiatives there will be no improvement in the staffing gaps.  Like it or not, without people there is no capability.  He said that it is destined to fail unless we see clearly defined milestones, independent oversight and accountability.  I could not agree more because without action this will simply be another report on a shelf and another missed opportunity except this time it will be done in the full knowledge of the implications because this report lays out the stark reality facing our Defence Forces into the future.<\/p>  <p>  What the report truly lays bare is that one reaps what one sows or, in this case, what one could not have bothered to sow.  For years we have seen plans an reports put forward by successive Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour Party, Green Party and a Dolly mixture of others who were in government at the time that were blatant in their lack of recognition of the vital role of the Defence Forces and of the threats and potential threats to the State.  Whether it was equipment, built infrastructure, Air Corps, Army, Naval Service, Reserves and veterans, the entire spectrum of the Defence Forces was seen as low-hanging fruit.  It was almost as they were unworthy of meaningful resourcing and yet increasingly expected to do more with less as numbers diminished.  I do not accept for one minute that when the nature of conflict began changing and the impact of climate change and its associated human cost was developing that no single person in the Government or the Department thought our Defence Forces would not have a role to play or appreciate the impact that a lack of investment would have.  Nor do I believe that when representative bodies and others raised concerns about the haemorrhaging of talent and skills that not one person thought to take action.  I believe, however, that there was a deliberate decision to ignore what was happening.  Instead there was an ostrich approach which has created, facilitated and resulted in the situation which faces our Defence Forces today.<\/p>  <p>  What truly galls me is that this was done with an attitude towards the greatest asset that the Defence Forces have - its people who serve the State often generation to generation - that their willingness to serve could almost be exploited to such a degree that low pay and poor conditions were acceptable.  They are not acceptable nor will they ever be acceptable.  One serving member on the working family payment is too many.  One family food parcel or homeless veteran is one too many. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 filleting of the Army was a mistake.  It was an unmitigated disaster and tore the heart out of the Army, particularly in the midlands.  I will be parochial here because today in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath there remain two closed barracks with no true defined purpose for over a decade.  One remains operational in Athlone.  The impact that reorganisation had on the Army was profound.  It was a very public example of that lack of vision and appreciation of the impact it would have on the wider structure.  I remember the closure of those barracks as do countless others in my constituency.  I remember serving members of the Army sleeping in cars because they could not afford the price of fuel to go home.  As for the barracks which remain, the height of vision for Custume Barracks in the infrastructure plan was a new dining hall.  We should all be very grateful that a modern army no longer marches on it stomach because given the current level of food ration allowances they would be lucky to get past Coosan.  At the very core, and something that is reflected in the report, is respect and loyalty.  The respect and loyalty shown by those in the military life has never been recognised by the Government.  Instead it is treated with a lack of interest and disdain.  The evidence of that is the repeated, successive and systemic failures by those tasked with overseeing the Defence Forces, the deafness scandal, Larium, the side effects of hazardous chemicals at Baldonnel, the Women of Honour and others with similar experiences, barracks crumbling, sleeping quarters with actual holes in the ceiling and an Air Corps that is not able to see into our sky or a Naval Service that is unable to see below sea level.  The 123 recommendations are not going to be easily achieved and some require a much wider conversation and decisions.  However, none will be achieved while respect and loyalty is not reciprocated.  The two-way street is absolutely vital for the future of our Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600048#BBB00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1645029720,"counter":371,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces have been under resourced for decades.  It is astonishing to know that Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces could not adequately protect itself from the risk of an attack should one happen.  The recent report was probably the most significant report into the Defence Forces in 50 years.  It looks like the Minister has inherited a total mess from his predecessor which raises serious questions.  Was he asleep at the wheel for a number of years leaving the current Minister and our State to clean up a huge messes with the continuous under-resourcing of the Defence Force?<\/p>  <p>  Then there are the Women of Honour revelations.  I may add that it is now alleged that previous Ministers knew of these allegations and brushed them under the carpet.  An independent investigation has to be called here to see who knows what and when they knew it as it very much looks like someone sat on their hands on this hugely important issue to the women in the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  This and other things that have taken place in the Defence Forces show the height of incompetence by the previous Minister or Ministers.  Even the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, called it out on numerous occasions when in opposition.<\/p>  <p>  We, the State, are now left with options.  One is to maintain the Defence Forces in its current form but increasing spending by tens of millions of euro on the current budget of &euro;1.1 billion.<\/p> <p>The second option is to enable the Defence Forces to hire more people and to purchase the likes of radar equipment and military aircraft.  This would cost about &euro;500 million extra annually.  The third option is to significantly increase the Defence Forces capabilities and this would involve the purchase of fighter jets, which looks like it would cost &euro;3 billion each year to fund.<\/p> <p> It is going to be hugely challenging for the Government to respond to this report due, as I said earlier, to the previous Minister of State with responsibility for defence's incompetence.  We have fallen miles behind in what many would say is the real world.  The recent report was a fine piece of work but was it the Russians making a move off our south-west coast that woke this Government up?  It made our country look weak and sloppy.  When a few fishermen from west Cork sat down with the Russians much of this worry off our coast receded.<\/p> <p>Why have we not been proactive instead of reactive on our Defence Forces?  When talking about defence, why do people like confrontational talk instead of doing as the west Cork fishermen did and sitting down and peacefully negotiating a solution suitable to all?  It is obvious Ireland could not adequately protect itself from any risk of an attack should one happen.  In a world that can at times be so volatile no one ever knows, but we could well face attack.  I genuinely ask whether there is a political will in this country to make changes.<\/p> <p> If we look at the last Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, did nothing to make changes.  How can this instil any confidence in the public that this Government will make the drastic changes that now needs to be made?  The paltry amount spent to date on defence by our Government has left Ireland wide open.  What successive Governments have spent to date reflects poorly on the priority of defence in Ireland.  I do not understand how some commentators are questioning us spending money and why we now have to make a political argument to spend potentially hundreds of million of euro on the Defence Forces to protect our own people when much of this should have been spent already, down through the years.  In the recent report, our Defence Forces were looked at in the same way as those of eight other similar countries that have made significant investment in their defence forces down through the years and that are not falling behind like we have in this island.<\/p> <p> The issue of pay in the Defence Forces is once again a historical and controversial issue that was left to drag on by the current Minister's predecessors.  Many feel the way forward here could be a simple measure to allow the two military representative organisations to affiliate with ICTU on the issue of pay.  It is wrong that military representatives had been locked out of national pay talks for decades.  This has led to a widening gap between military pay and other pay.  It would be wrong of any politician in here not to co-operate on spending the necessary funds to bring our Defence Forces up to some kind of recognisable standards and to allow this country stand proud and have the ability to protect itself if any danger arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600048#BBB00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645030320,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am also happy to speak on these matters.  I welcome the report, although a report is not much good to struggling Army personnel.  I am awfully disappointed.  I come from south Tipperary.  We had a very proud record with the Army in Clonmel.  We had a wonderful barracks and battalion there.  It served with dignity and looked after the townspeople whenever there were floods or any other kind of disasters.  The soldiers were the first out to help.  The Minister of State's Fine Gael Government robbed us of that.  Phil Hogan moved them to Kilkenny.  To hell or to Connacht.  Some of them went to Limerick.  Many of them left.  We are now in a situation that is totally untenable for the Army.  It is blindfolded with its hands behind its back.  There is no capability in the Naval Service and very little in the Air Corps.  While I welcome the recent Cabinet decision to reinstate the helicopter in the south east and the search and rescue, I am disappointed the Air Corps has no part in that, even on a supporting basis.  What are we doing?  Are we going to stand it down completely?  We are giving out huge, lucrative contracts to private companies.  Our Army could be used to supplement and complement that outcome.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the Women of Honour.  My goodness, how much more do they have to endure?  Why can they not be listened to and dealt with sensibly?  Deputy Michael Collins mentioned Deputy Kehoe, who formerly had responsibility for this area.  He did not care for the Army.  He showed arrogance toward the personnel in Clonmel and different places.  We were so embarrassed.  In my own village there are Army personnel who served in the Lebanon and other dangerous parts of the world.  I salute all members of the Defence Forces who served in peacekeeping.  We did not have an Army personnel carrier.  They were booked to come home to their families, with christenings and everything planned, but they were waiting for more than two weeks in the heat of midsummer with no personnel to bring home our own soldiers.  What are we at?  They were out there serving our nation's flag proudly and we abandoned them.  It was two or three weeks before they could get home, which was past the time they were supposed be home.  Imagine the weight on and the angst among the families during that time.  It was a very degrading thing to do to them.<\/p>  <p>  Where do we go now?  The report recommends a number of measures.  All involve large sums of money but it is like a car in that if it is totally clapped-out you are going to get nothing for it.  We should have been investing.  We all appreciate there were cuts back in 2009 and 2010 but we have cut and cut.  I salute the former Minister of State, Willie Penrose, of the Labour Party who stood with honour and resigned his position to defend the barracks and soldiers in the midlands.  Others, like our own from Tipperary, just voted with the Government, T&aacute;, T&aacute;, T&aacute;, to get rid of the barracks.  It was a disaster for the town of Clonmel.  It was as bad as losing any industry.  I refer to the dignity and the pride and the Army women.  The Army members could not lobby but the Army wives lobbied so hard.  They literally begged the politicians.  Their morale was so low as well because they were not listened to.  They were crushed.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, we have a proud record, going back a great length of time to the Congo, of serving abroad and being recognised as an independent nation.  Now we do not know what we are.  We do not know whether we are independent, neutral or what we are.  We are neither this nor that.  We have debates here about PESCO and many other things.  We are not really being honest with ourselves when we put our hand on our heart and say we are neutral.  We are not.  We are being laughed at and being used.  We are depending on aircraft from other countries to defend our waters and our airspace.  We conceded that after 9\/11 and that was a temporary arrangement.  The fact is we do not have the jets to defend our country.  What kind of pride have we in our nation that we allow this to go on?  I would say there is none.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's party has been in government for ten or 11 years and it cares little for the Army.  Of course, soldiers would not mainly be Fine Gael voters.  Pay and conditions are atrocious.  Defence Forces' members are going to supplementary welfare officers begging for a pittance.  The other big bugbear I have is around when dignitaries visit.  We recently got news Prince Charles will be visiting my constituency shortly.  He will be asked about Bloody Sunday and those issues and they must not be swept under the carpet but he is paying a visit that will be respected by the people of Tipperary and he will be welcome.  I am sure the Army will be there supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Army members are like third-class citizens with the treatment they get.  They do not get any of the stipends, a proper place to sleep or proper food parcels.  It is despicable the way they are treated.  They are treated like fourth- or fifth-class citizens.  We saw that when President Trump and different people came, such as when his Holiness the Pope came to Ireland.  It is shocking we would treat the defenders of our nation, flag and sovereignty like that.  The disrespect we have for Army personnel is shocking and must change.  That report is useless if we do not show them the respect and dignity they deserve and have them be able to serve with pride and honour for the sake of their country, which is what they signed up to do.  We have such a drain of pilots and others to private industry.  I am appealing to the Government to show personnel respect and dignity and to look after the Women of Honour also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600049#CCC00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1645030320,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Like many Deputies, I welcome the publication of this report.  Our Defence Forces do an excellent job and need to be supported in that and recognised for the work they do for us.  I spoke before in the House about the Defence Forces and said quite frequently we see them reported on in the media in negative terms, such as in the context of the crisis of recruitment, the poor pay and conditions, the poverty of Army families and the challenges we face.  What we really have is a vast body of men and women whose role, job and vocation is to support the State and stand in the way of whatever dangers we may ask them to.  It is positive the report of the commission talks a lot about the impact of climate change because as that bites and the floods, storms and adverse weather conditions get worse, it is only the Defence Forces we can rely on in that role of aid to the civil power.  That means standing in the breach, providing the bridges we will need, the airlifts and the support to cut-off communities.<\/p> <p>They have done that in excellent ways in the past.  We have a proud tradition in this country of involvement in the United Nations and peacekeeping work.  Many young men and women want to be part of that tradition.  They do not see the Army, however, as an appealing place to work because of all these problems.  The vocation for international duties and peacekeeping work has been tarnished by cosying up to things such as PESCO and various other multilateral arrangements. <\/p> <p> We are at a turning point when it comes to our Defence Forces.  The commission was an excellent exercise.  It has done its work and we in this Chamber and Ministers at the Cabinet table have a lot of hard work to do.  There are many things to welcome in this report, such as commitments to increase recruitment and to reorganise structures.  There is talk of the creation of a new rank of lance corporal, which is very positive in acknowledging progression, in addition to providing leadership opportunities and career development opportunities.  There is a recommendation around affiliation with ICTU, which is a very important thing for PDFORRA and on-the-ground members of the Defence Forces.  These are essential things we need to do, if we are to hit these new targets and increase recruitment.  Equally, we need to address the many things driving people to leave the Defence Forces.  Pay and conditions were not considered as part of the terms of reference.  The report is silent on those matters, but we need to address them if we are to have any hope of recruiting the extra personnel the commission talks about us needing.<\/p> <p> The members of the Women of Honour group mentioned by other Deputies need all the supports they are looking for in order that we can ensure the Defence Forces, as everywhere else, is a safe place to work and will be an appealing place for women to work.  There is a vocation to serving in the Defence Forces that is not just for men.  If they are provided with a safe place, women will happily sign up to that vocation of international service and aid to civilian power.  <\/p> <p> We talk about purchasing new ships for the Naval Service but we struggle to crew the ships we have at present.  I do not understand how we will expand our Naval Service.  We can talk about whether we should or why, and all the reasons that are in the report, but we struggle at present to crew the naval vessels we have.  I do not understand how we will address this.<\/p> <p> I have talked about pay and safety for members in the Defence Forces but there are wider conditions.  Are we providing proper housing on barracks?  Are we providing reasonable standards of accommodation for members of the Defence Forces?  Are we providing reasonable opportunities for growth, development and leadership?  There are many choices members of the Defence Forces have to make if they choose to take on overseas service, which is part of our proud tradition of peacekeeping.  They are deeply aware that while they are serving overseas their role is not being backfilled in their barracks at home.  That is causing stress for the other men and women in their unit, who now have to do two, three or four jobs because their colleagues have the honour of going off to serve with the UN.  That kind of stress makes people question their role in the services. <\/p> <p> If we do not address the fundamental pay, conditions and quality of life issues for the average soldier, we will not achieve the higher ambitions we have set ourselves.  We need to achieve those higher ambitions.  As I said at the start, the aid to civilian power piece is a very important role the Defence Forces play.  We have seen it with the Covid pandemic, during which we called on the Defence Forces when we needed to ramp up our testing facilities very quickly.  When we needed to provide mandatory quarantine for people arriving at airports, we called on the Defence Forces.  When there is an emergency we call on it, and its members willingly step into the breach because that is the vocation they have chosen.  We will not get other people to choose that vocation and we will not get people to do what we need to do to keep the rest of us safe unless we address those fundamental issues of pay and conditions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600049#CCC00300","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645030920,"counter":376,"content":"<p>As I do not see Deputy Durkan, I will move on to Deputy Connolly who has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600050#DDD00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1645030920,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this discussion.  I note the report highlights a &quot;paucity of real debate on defence and security matters in [the] country&quot; and that the commission &quot;hopes...a more informed and grounded debate on these matters&quot; will arise from it.  I echo that but I will take it further in that there is a complete absence of a debate on grounding any talk about defence and increasing our military spending within the values we treasure and the articles of the Constitution that commit us to being a country that works for peace, not a country that puts it hand up to be the best in the warmongering class.  I would prefer our debate to take place on how we become the best country in the peacekeeping class as a neutral country.<\/p><p>The Minister has left the Chamber.  I understand he cannot be here all the time, but he posed the question - had we read the report?  I can tell him I have read the entire report of approximately 250 pages.  It raises many things - I have only four minutes and will not go into them - and there are 11 chapters.  There are four sections in chapter 8 that deal with people, such is their value as the Defence Force's &quot;key strategic resource&quot;.  The one thing any government at any stage has not done is to treasure our people in the Defence Forces as the key strategic resource.  As has been mentioned, terms and conditions were not under the commission's terms of reference.  I will leave that at present.<\/p><p>Among many things the report highlighted were a serious &quot;sense of crisis&quot;, a serious sense by those on the ground of not being heard, &quot;a serious desire for change at all levels&quot;, &quot;a disconnect between stated policy, resources and capabilities&quot;, an &quot;inadequacy of...grievance processes&quot;, fears of reprisal, disempowerment and evidence across the Defence Forces of a culture that is masculine and has &quot;a limited appreciation of diversity&quot;.  The Women of Honour group gets a very small reference in the report, on page 100, which is interesting.  I pay tribute to the amount of work done by the commission's 16 members and the speed of it, given the amount of time.  The report is laid out very clearly.<\/p><p>I come from Galway city, where there was a little celebration last week, as the Minister of State well knows, to mark the handing over of the D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa barracks 100 years ago.  Ireland joined the League of Nations the following year.  That was a doomed organisation but it had very good ambitions, including disarmament, preventing war, settling disputes by peaceful means and improving global welfare.  In today's terms, we talk about getting rid of inequality as the major way to stop war.  That was approximately 100 years ago.  That organisation was doomed but we moved forward and joined the UN in 1955.  As has been said, since 1958 we have an unbroken record of service in UN peacekeeping forces.  As Clare Daly put it in her submission to the commission, we have served in more than 20 peacekeeping operations.  It has been a lot more than that but we have been somewhere every single day of the year since 1958.  I will highlight the submissions to the commission from the Quakers, Clare Daly, the World Beyond War organisation and the Peace and Neutrality Alliance.  They are worth looking at because they lift the debate out of the definite necessities of tackling the retention crisis in the Army to consider the sole purpose of our Army.  What is it for?  How do we achieve that?<\/p><p>Before I give any endorsement to the billions that have been mentioned, I would like a frank and honest discussion of the role of our Defence Forces.  To consider the United Nations, Denis Halliday has been quoted in one of the submissions as saying that our &quot;reputation for integrity and decency and doing a good job&quot; is second to none.  Dr. Michael Ryan from the World Health Organization, a man we quoted <i>ad nauseam<\/i>when it suited us in respect of Covid, in his address at the Tr&oacute;caire Oscar Romero awards ceremony, &quot;warned against the enormous waste of global defence investment urging nations to radically change the mindset ... on [the] imagined threats from other nations&quot;.<\/p> <p>The real threat is climate change.  It barely gets a mention in the report and only in terms of the consequences of environmental degradation.  On page 5, the report states that the risk of attack is very low yet we are talking about putting billions of euro into an army in order that we can be the best boys and girls, put our hands up and say we are top of the warmongering class, as opposed to the peacekeeping class.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600050#DDD00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645031520,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this report, which is wide-ranging in its recommendations and makes for an interesting read.  I agree that overall we must continue to resource our Defence Forces to ensure they are properly equipped and trained for the roles that we require them to undertake but ultimately, what should be at the heart of this report is ensuring that we protect our neutrality.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendations contained within the report, I support the cultural change processes outlined, particularly in regard to female participation and diversity.  The development of expanded recruitment channels for the recruitment and participation of under\u2010represented groups is welcome.  I agree that we should enable easier access to Irish citizenship for those who serve in the Defence Forces.  We need to recognise barriers that those under-represented groups face when joining the Defence Forces, such as family-friendly hours, about which a lot has been already said.  I welcome that the report recommends the extension and enhancement of family-friendly policies, howsoever they would work within the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome that the report takes into account green defence.  This is an area that needs to be highlighted further in the future.  We should ensure that our military sets ambitious environmental targets and that analysis of green defence solutions and horizon scanning to identify emerging technologies is embedded in the capability development and planning process of our Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The final recommendation of the report calls on the Government and Oireachtas to urgently address the need to define a clear level of ambition for the major roles of the Defence Forces.  I thought it was fairly clear that we are a neutral State and that is what we will continue to be.  This includes defence of the State, its people and its resources and overseas missions.  We must be very careful when we are considering this.  The vision as stated in the executive summary is that the Defence Forces should remain poised to meet the challenges of an evolving and complex world.  What does that mean?  That is, I believe, the crux of the problem.  I am very concerned about a concerted move away from neutrality, which I believe is the aim for some in government.  We must ensure that this is discouraged by all means necessary.  The executive summary statement could mean anything.  There is a danger that in a couple of years time the Minister would be here talking about how we are meeting the needs as outlined in this document but we would actually be going to war on behalf of Europe, France, Germany or whoever.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about the ongoing militarisation of the EU.  We need to ensure that in the resourcing of our Defence Forces, the aim is not to create or participate in any sort of European army, but to ensure that our neutrality is at the core of everything we do.  Our armed forces have a great tradition of engaging in peacekeeping activities internationally, especially in the UN and the UN-supported peacekeeping missions, of which Ireland has been involved in 527.  As of August 2021, more than 550 Irish personnel were deployed to civilian and military international crisis management and peace support operations around the world, many of whom trained close to where I live in Ballyshannon, where centenary commemorations of the handover of Finner Camp from British to Irish military forces will take place tomorrow. <\/p>  <p>  Our international peacekeeping endeavours should be commended.  I would like to see a continuation of this country&rsquo;s focus on peacekeeping when we are setting a clear level of ambition for the major roles of the Defence Forces.  That should be our aim, not the joining of NATO or an EU so-called defence organisation.  This is where we should be setting our sights.  I agree with the different options that are outlined in the report and option 2 seems to be the one that probably would be the best in terms of meeting those needs.  We need to clearly set out our intention.  I have my doubts as to whether the intention of everyone in government or of the Government is to ensure that we continue in our peacekeeping role and remain focused on being able to manage and do that properly.  We need to ensure that in this we are not masking preparations for a role in terms of NATO or an EU defence programme.  If that is what is intended, the Government should be clear and say it and let people have the debate on that.  It should not be masking or hiding its intentions, as I believe is happening here.  <\/p>  <p>  We are getting to the stage where we are seeing the running down of the Defence Forces.  The withdrawal of the capabilities of our Defence Forces will be used by some to make the point that if we want to update our Defence Forces, we have to do it this way, we have to go this far and we have to play our role in terms of defending the EU, NATO or whatever.  We do not.  We can have Defence Forces that function as a defence force, as something that we need, we want and all our citizens want.  We can maintain that through the peacekeeping roles we already play.  We can strengthen the Defence Forces to make sure that happens without going the full hog or the whole way in terms being a part of NATO and so on.  We can do that if people discuss and agree it and believe that is the way it is going to be.  That is important.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600051#EEE00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1645031520,"counter":380,"content":"<p>As we are within time, I propose to give Deputy Durkan five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600051#EEE00300","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1645031520,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have this opportunity.  I had two meetings going on at the same time, which is pretty difficult at the best of times.<\/p>  <p>  I fully endorse, support and accept the recommendations of the review.  The Ceann Comhairle and I represent a county that has long-established traditions with the Defence Forces.  I cannot understand why, over the past number of years we have become apologetic about our Defence Forces, as if they were unnecessary.  There are people in this House who will tell us they are unnecessary and who question why, if we are a neutral country we need the Defence Forces?  The answer to that question is simple.  We may have to defend our neutrality as well.  I refer to the western Balkans, where a few years ago there were appalling outrages.  The issue was raised in this House several times at that time.  We could complain as much as we liked, wring our hands and tear out our hair but we could do nothing about it.  In that case, NATO was brought in to deal with the situation and it did.  The UN was side-tracked at the time because it was ill-equipped to deal with the magnitude of the forces opposed to it.<\/p>  <p>  It is high time we fully recognised the important role of the Defence Forces in this country.  They play a pivotal role in defence and in supporting the services that we rely on in times of stress, bad weather, snowstorms and so on.  Time and again, they have come out to support us.  We should respond in kind, in a way that recognises their existence, the importance of the role they play and that we need them to stand up for us when we may not be able to stand up for ourselves.  We should recognise also that for the past 50 years they have displayed their valour extremely well in various difficult situations all over the world.  It would be a total injustice if we were to ignore that now. <\/p>  <p>  I strongly support the Defence Forces for the reasons outlined.  I believe those reasons will increase as time goes by.  In light of the work they have done over the years and the defence the public had in them, we now need to respond and show them that we have confidence in them and they, in turn, can have confidence in us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600051#EEE00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1645031520,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who spoke for their contributions on this very important subject.  Providing for the defence of the state is a fundamental role of any government.  Each country addresses its needs in the context of its geopolitical position, prevailing security environment and the level of funding available.  As part of the defence planning process, the White Paper on Defence in 2015 and the White Paper update of 2019 were based on security environment assessments carried out by the interdepartmental working groups.  These threat assessments indicated a low probability of a conventional military attack on the State and pointed to the fact that security challenges are such that no single country can deal with them alone. <\/p>  <p>  The commission's report covers a number of distinct areas to be given careful consideration.  The levels of ambition set out vary considerably.  The recommended first step to level of ambition 2 from current capability requires a 50% increase to current defence spending.  The personnel increase recommended under LOA 2 would require an increase of over 3,000 personnel above current strength.  Even with an increased capacity to induct and train recruits and cadets, such an increase would require a number of years to implement.<\/p> <p>Similarly, the recommended equipment capabilities would require lead-in times, following in-depth analysis of exactly what function these platforms and capabilities were to fulfil.  The structural changes recommended would be the most significant in the defence sector since the foundation of the State and would be a major shift from delegating military command from the Minister to a number of senior military ranks to delegating it from the Minister to one individual, the chief of defence.  This and other structural recommendations, due to their significance and impact, require detailed cross-departmental discussion and deliberation.  They will also require the input of legal expertise, as any changes in this area would most likely require changes to legislation.<\/p> <p> The report has a major focus on people issues.  The people who serve in the Defence Forces, both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, are their greatest asset.  They will be central to changes arising from this report.  There are wide-ranging and significant recommendations in the report.  While there are policies, systems and procedures currently in place for dealing with allegations and complaints of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace, it is clear from the strong views expressed at the meetings the Minister has had with stakeholders, including serving members, Women of Honour and the men and women of honour group, that the pervading culture in the Defence Forces and those policies, systems and procedures have not served, and are not serving, all Defence Forces personnel well.  In response, the Minister established the independent review into dignity and equality issues in the Defence Forces to ensure the Defence Forces are a safe workplace for all current serving members, while also reviewing historical allegations.  <\/p> <p> The commission makes recommendations around strategic HR development and working arrangements to reflect the changes that have occurred in the wider employment area, to encourage retention and to facilitate more flexible working arrangements.  The commission recommends a number of civilian appointments within the Defence Forces' structure, such as the head of transformation already mentioned but also possibly in the area of strategic HR and finance and possible greater civilianisation of certain posts which would free up military personnel for front-line duties.  <\/p> <p> The commission also makes recommendations around pay structures but it must be pointed out that their terms of reference did not include reviewing pay rates.  Public sector pay policy is within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Now that the commission has finished its work, and in keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, the Minister for Defence will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body.  The Minister for Defence is keen to make the Defence Forces an employer of choice.  The Defence Forces offer an interesting, exciting and varied career for people and it is important that the positive aspects of a life serving in the Defence Forces are made clear, together with the totality of the benefits of working in the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> The Reserve Defence Force has seen a reduction in numbers in recent years.  The commission is clear in its ambition in this area and how the knowledge, skills and experience within the RDF ranks can be better captured and utilised.  The Reserve is a key aspect of contingent capability and improvements are required in how we recruit and utilise the Reserve.  This report gives an opportunity to revitalise the RDF and better employ the skills of its members.<\/p> <p> The report's finding on the level of defence funding is clear and highlights the difference between defence funding in Ireland and other western and northern European countries of similar size.  This reflects the differing priority given to defence spending in these countries and their own geopolitical considerations.  The White Paper highlighted the importance of capability development and since 2015, over &euro;806 million has been invested in the renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure.  Capital spending has increased from &euro;89.4 million in 2015 to &euro;129.5 million in 2021.  This is an increase of &euro;40.1 million or 45% on 2015 expenditure.  In the future, multi-annual capital funding of &euro;566 million has been allocated to defence out to 2025 under the national development plan, with &euro;141 million provided in 2022.  While this has been a positive development, the commission's report highlights the scale of the challenge that exists in bridging capability gaps.<\/p> <p> There have been calls for quick movement on the recommendations within the report and the Minister is keen to do so, where possible, but there are significant recommendations that must be discussed and considered fully and their possible implications examined.  The commission acknowledged in its report that some of the recommendations will impact significantly on current governance structures.  Subject to Government decisions on the report, the future governance and oversight framework of the Minister and the Department of Defence may need to be redesigned to provide effective assurance and accountability.  As this was outside its terms of reference, it was not developed in the commission's report and, therefore, will require significant work to explore and align the ramifications of certain recommendations and that, in turn, will determine how other recommendations progress.<\/p> <p> Other aspects to be investigated will also include any possible legislative impacts and what changes this will require.  A number of recommendations and commentary in the report concern other Departments and agencies, and these will require interdepartmental consultation and consideration to fully explore the best way forward on these issues.  Significant work is currently ongoing, which the commission has referred to in its report, as was outlined at the beginning of this debate.  This important work will continue.  As the Minister said in his opening statement, he wants to ensure that he is committed to progressing the work carried out by the commission and seizing this opportunity to develop Defence Forces that are agile and modern, designed not just for today but for the future.<\/p> <p> The Minister welcomes the debate on this important subject.  There needs to be a wider debate on defence provision in Ireland beyond the normal actors.  The Minister looks forward to expanding this debate and encouraging open discussion around the serious issues and recommendations in the commission report.  The Minister intends to examine the use of seminars or other consultative structures to encourage and lead this debate.  He may not agree with all that has been said today but the Minister welcomes the fact that we are having the discussion and thanks all Deputies for their contributions.  Further discussion will be required as part of the deliberations of this significant report.  I encourage all Deputies to be a part of that conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600051#EEE00500","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1645032120,"counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600052#FFF00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645032120,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1645032120,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The Government is in possession.

The directive provides for a set of minimum standards for the protection of whistleblowers across the European Union.  It was supposed to be transposed by December 2021.  Given that this time has passed, the State could potentially incur a fine.  This is not the first time I have discussed potential fines because of the Government's failure to introduce EU law.  We are still waiting on microgeneration to ease the burden on those who can afford renewable energy technology.  There are a number of weaknesses in the current legislation which this legislation should address.  However, there are concerns that the transposition could be used as an opportunity to weaken existing protections.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues, na Teachta&iacute; Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Buckley, introduced their own Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill last year to address these concerns.  That Bill was designed to help inform the finance committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill introduced by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  The finance committee report was published in December and was quite critical of the Government's Bill in certain respects.  The report makes approximately 60 recommendations, including how the existing framework could be improved, and identifies potentially regressive revisions in the new Bill that should be removed.  A number of the recommendations are directly reflected in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  The Minister has taken some of them on board and has amended this Bill accordingly but he has chosen to ignore others.  We have submitted amendments to this Bill and I urge the Minister to consider them.  We know the State has serious issues when it comes to accountability.  That is especially true of State institutions.  We saw that recently when Kildare County Council almost had to take the Department of Defence to court to get answers on dumping in the Curragh, dumping which was committed by the Department.  When the council finally got the Department to mediation, in an effort to save public money on a court case, a curtain of secrecy was drawn down.<\/p> <p>It appears that a non-disclosure agreement is in place.  Prince Andrew would be very proud, I can tell you.  Not even the elected members of Kildare County Council know if there are any consequences for the person who ordered the dumping or even if he or she was identified.  This is shameful.  The Government must learn from the experience of whistleblowers.  They have been paid enough lip service and it is time now to take action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600052#FFF00500","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645032720,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation and outline some concerns, which I hope can be addressed as the Bill passes through the legislative stages.  It is often said that the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is strong by international standards but many experts and advocacy organisations have contended that it is very difficult to make such an assessment as there has been a relatively small amount of case law since 2014.<\/p>  <p>  On the ground, however, it is quite clear that those who have made a protected disclosure often paid a very high price for doing so in terms of career prospects, finances and mental health.  This was evident in the testimonies of whistleblowers who appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Those same issues have also been shown to be the case in terms of research that has been carried out in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 integrity at work survey revealed that 21% of respondents who reported wrongdoing said they had suffered for sharing their concerns.  It also found that the negative impact of making a disclosure on careers and personal life was a major barrier to reporting wrongdoing in the first place.  In that same survey, 31% of people said they would fear losing their jobs, while 13% feared isolation from their colleagues.  It is clear, therefore, that we need to update continuously and strengthen protections for whistleblowers.  It should not take an EU directive to force our hand.<\/p>  <p>  There have certainly been a few cases recently where there have been big concerns about the treatment of whistleblowers.  I want to mention one particular case that arose recently with regard to the serious shortcomings in the child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, in County Kerry.  While a report was carried out on that, we did not hear anything about what will happen about the whistleblower who really put his neck on the line and ended up leaving the HSE.  He was a very well-qualified and very good doctor who spoke out when that was the right thing to do.  He stood up and spoke out and yet he was sidelined and eventually felt he had to leave the organisation.  We have to learn from this.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the big case of a whistleblower being badly treated by Government and to a large extent by society was Sergeant McCabe.  He paid a huge price for that and was eventually found to be entirely vindicated.  There is still an issue in the culture within some of our public departments, organisations and agencies, however, that does not encourage people speaking out when they witness wrongdoing.  We have to do that.  That culture has to change.  It has to be seen as a positive thing for employees to call out wrongdoing.  That is how we improve the performance of our organisations and also how we ensure a healthier atmosphere.  The opposite of that is something that Mr. Eddie Molloy, somebody who very often gives a lot of very good advice, calls the culture of going along to get along.  Too often, senior officials go along with things they should not be going along with.  They do not say anything about it just to get along.  That culture has to change.<\/p>  <p>  In reviewing the 2014 Act, it is apparent that the definition of \"relevant wrongdoing\" was quite limited.  I welcome the amendment in section 6 that would correct this to include all matters which fall within the scope of the directive such as \"public health\" and \"consumer protection\".  It is, however, disappointing that interpersonal grievances between workers will not be considered a relevant wrongdoing.  Upon initial reading, this may seem to make sense but it is not a black and white issue.  I fear this provision could have unintended consequences for workers.  As the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, pointed out in its observations and recommendations on the general scheme of the Bill, grievances and protected disclosures can often be intertwined or can overlap.  Guidance is already provided under the current framework as to how to make a distinction between grievances and protected disclosures and how to deal with them.  I cannot, therefore, see why this needs to be legislated for, particularly in the absence of an explicit definition of \"interpersonal grievances\".  Disclosures pertaining to bullying, unfair discriminatory treatment or dangerous working conditions, for example, could be characterised by employers as such and therefore not be appropriately acted upon.  Also, employers could use previous or long-standing interpersonal grievances between employees to dismiss relevant wrongdoings.  Why, therefore, is there a need for this decision in our legislation?  While it is permitted, the directive does not require it.<\/p>  <p>  All workers should be facilitated to make protected closures regardless of company size, whether it is public or private, terms of contract, pay etc.  The term \"worker\" is quite restrictive in the current legislation, however.  It is, therefore, welcome that the definition of a worker has been extended to encompass such reporting persons as volunteers or applicants to an organisation.  We should always be striving to extend access to justice to the greatest extent possible.  Expanding the definition of a worker in this context will have a positive impact.  This will be especially felt by minorities and people in precarious work situations who in many cases have not been adequately protected under the current regime.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a further point in this regard.  It is crucial that this change to the definition of \"worker\" is communicated effectively.  My fear is that many people such as volunteers will not make protected disclosures because they may not think the legislation applies to them.  In such instances, effective and robust formal channels and procedures for making a protected disclosure will be of the utmost importance.  This is a particularly salient point in the charity and non-profit sector, in my view, where there are a large number of people working in a voluntary capacity and often also serving on boards.<\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Bill places an obligation on private sector employers with 50 or more employees to \"establish, maintain and operate internal reporting channels ... [alongside] procedures for the making of ... reports and for [timely] follow-up\".  The distinction between employers based on the size of an organisation in my view is problematic.  It will mean that a large swathe of workers will not actually be protected.  I appreciate the rationale provided in the regulatory impact assessment of the Bill, that is, that a blanket requirement on private bodies with fewer than 50 employees would impose compliance costs on large parts of the economy and could be unworkable in many situations.  However, this assessment does not place enough emphasis on the potential impact of exempting all small employers, however, including businesses dealing with large volumes of funds and personal data.  A tech company that has a small number of employees, for example, could be engaged in data misuse or abuse on a very large scale far exceeding its on-the-ground operation.  Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in 2019 showed that small enterprises, characterised as those with fewer than ten persons, accounted for 92.2% of enterprises in the economy and 25.6% of workers, while enterprises with ten to 49 persons accounted for 6.2% of enterprises and 20.5% of workers.<\/p> <p>This means that close to one in every two private sector employees would not be covered by this provision and the vast majority of private sector employers would have no obligation to adopt reporting procedures.  As a result, it is patently clear that the legislation is extremely weak in this regard and needs to be amended.  There is a clear imbalance between the interests of employers and employees in respect of smaller private companies.  The proposed legislation is too concerned with protecting those employers at the expense of employees reporting wrongdoing.  The question must be asked as to what it is we are protecting employers from.  Surely having robust internal reporting channels and procedures in place would help to mitigate against legal, financial and reputational risks.<\/p> <p> In effect, this decision was taken, I believe, on the basis of cost.  While that must obviously be a consideration, particularly after a difficult two years for many businesses, the issue of cost is not insurmountable and should not be used as a barrier to increasing protections for all workers.  As Transparency International Ireland highlighted in its submission on the transposition of this EU directive, all employers have legal obligations to protect employees in different areas.  Protected disclosures should be no different.  For example, it is mandatory, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, for employers to have undertaken a health and safety risk assessment and have procedures in place to prevent bullying.  The Health and Safety Authority provides standard policies for employers to adopt, thus making the process easier and minimising expense.  A similar approach should be used for protected disclosures.  The code of practice that was established by statutory instrument in reference to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 already includes a model protected disclosures policy that could be updated and adopted by employers at minimal expense.  This is a workable solution that would create the conditions for all employers, regardless of size, to comply.  Not only would it provide protection for all private sector workers, it would allow for more reports to be dealt with quickly through established reporting channels, with a lesser need for external reporting.  That would be desirable all around.  It would also assist in ensuring the new protected disclosures office does not become overrun with cases from companies that do not have the necessary reporting channels and procedures already in place.<\/p> <p> Section 14 provides for the creation of an office of the protected disclosures commissioner within the Office of the Ombudsman.  I very much support this provision as it should, if resourced properly, create a more efficient and whistleblower-friendly regime, ensuring consistency in reporting, investigation and communication.  Aside from whistleblowers' concerns regarding future employment and ostracisation in the workplace, another barrier to reporting is often the complexity of doing so.  The new office will have a key role in directing reports to the right place and providing support in assessing and investigating protected disclosures.  It will also act as the default authority and de facto safeguard for workers in the event there is not an appropriate regulator to address their concerns.  This will be especially important given the increased range of regulatory matters in respect of which protected disclosures can now be made, such as breaches of European law.<\/p> <p> Of course, we must not lose sight of the fact that at the heart of this issue is corruption and wrongdoing.  While greater protections for whistleblowers and appropriate channels for reporting are absolutely vital, we need a more comprehensive strategy to prevent wrongdoing and corruption in the first place.  As in all policy areas, prevention is better than cure.  Laws around corruption are scattered across multiple legislative provisions and there is no overarching or consolidated approach to combatting it.  We in the Social Democrats have long advocated for a culture of open government and a root-and-branch reform of the anti-corruption regime in Ireland.  Key to this would be the establishment of a new law enforcement body - an independent anti-corruption agency - to tackle white-collar crime and corruption in the corporate world and in political spheres.  Unless we start dealing with the root cause of these problems, we will continue to stumble into one crisis after another.<\/p> <p> This very technical legislation has provided a much needed opportunity to reflect on our protected disclosure regime.  It is a regime that certainly needs to be improved to protect whistleblowers from the chilling effect of reporting wrongdoing.  However, the Bill, in its current form, will not radically improve the situation.  This is because many arms of the State and private companies will continue to be more concerned with reputational damage than protecting the public interest.  We have seen this play out in case after case involving whistleblowers, whether in the health service, policing or finance.  I do not believe this legislation will create the sufficient cultural shift that is needed to address this.  For that to happen, the Bill would need to be stronger in its protection of whistleblowers and the Government would need to accompany it with a commitment to rooting out corruption in public and private life.  There must be consequences for people when they are found to be engaged in wrongdoing or corruption.  Too often, we have an investigation and the findings of that investigation may be referred to the Garda but nothing else happens.  It runs into the sand.  We have seen that across a number of different models of investigations and inquiries in this country.  There is nothing more dispiriting for people than being aware that individuals or organisations have clearly been engaging in corruption and wrongdoing and there being no consequences for them.<\/p> <p> It is regrettable than this Bill is only before the House now, almost two months after it was supposed to be implemented.  This matter should have been higher on the Department's agenda given the urgent need for a stronger regime.  Notwithstanding that, I appreciate and welcome the Minister of State's commitment to engage with the relevant committee on possible amendments.  A shared commitment to creating a gold standard protected disclosure regime has been expressed across the House.  I hope the Minister of State will endeavour to improve the legislation.  The public and the political system can only benefit by there being such a regime.  There is no doubt that the country would hugely benefit from a situation where corruption and wrongdoing are ruled out and there is clear evidence to the public in general that where people engage in such wrongdoing and corruption, they will ultimately have to pay a substantial price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600053#GGG00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645033320,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill.  I am confident it will enhance and strengthen the protections for whistleblowers in this country.  Ireland has had a legislative framework on whistleblowers dating back to 2014 and we have learned a lot more since that Act came into force.<\/p> <p>Ireland is one of a small number of EU countries that continues to have such a regime in place before the EU directive.  In many instances, the 2014 Act has afforded vital protections to whistleblowers.  Nonetheless, a number of high-profile cases have shown us that we can never be complacent about protecting those who are reporting wrongdoing by public and private sector organisations.  It is important, therefore, that we take this opportunity to improve our legislative framework for dealing with protected disclosures.<\/p> <p> The most famous whistleblower I can think of, and the person who most of us associate with whistleblowing, is Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  He demonstrated great bravery.  For many years, this House was used in order to tell his story at a time when it was not being listened to.  Since 2014, much of what we have learned about whistleblowing, about its deficiencies and about the ways that needs to be legally tightened up, have come from that old case.  I want to pay tribute to him on the record of the D&aacute;il.  Arising from Sergeant McCabe's whistleblowing, there was a whole political reaction.  I would say that it was a positive one.  The man had his name was cleared, and rightly so.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then had to look internally at how it was functioning and how it could improve practice.<\/p> <p> Very often, when an organisation seeks to make improvements and straighten practice, it looks beyond its own jurisdictions.  In the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it very much cast its eyes towards the Six Counties to see how the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, operates.  In trying to deal with whistleblowing and with some of the inadequacies within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was wrong to look across the Border.  It was wrong to look at some of the practices in Northern Ireland.  The policing model we have in Ireland dates all the way back to 1922.  It is a model of policing by consent.  We all know our local garda&iacute;.  I see them involved in local GAA clubs and in coaching.  They are very much involved with children and with groups in the community.  This is about building up a rapport, which becomes evident and important when there is a crime in the locality.  People will feel that their local garda is someone they can go to.  They can talk to them discreetly and confidentially.  It is a way of sharing information.  All of that dates all the way to back to the quaint days of the garda pushing the bike through the local village.  There was a building of a rapport within the community.  I believe that we have wrongly looked at the model of the PSNI in Northern Ireland.  Policing there has to be far more robust, because of the environment in which it operates.  Armoured cars still patrol streets at night-time.  There just simply is not that same ethos of policing by consent that we have always had here, in the 26 counties.<\/p> <p> I want to drill down a little bit more into that.  When new recruits first attend the Garda Training College in Templemore, they are given various training manuals.  One of them relates to the principle of discretion.  That manifests itself in many ways.  One way that this principle can be applied is when any one of us is driving our car on the road and we lean a little heavier on the accelerator than we should do and exceed the speed limit as a result.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has full power under the Road Traffic Act in that moment to turn on the blue light, pull us over and ask for all of our details and driving licence.  We will then face the wrath of penalty points.  However, the individual garda in that moment has the principle of discretion at his or her disposal.  This dates all the way back to 1922.  The centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, in fact, this year.  The garda has the discretion to say, &ldquo;Well, John was going to maternity hospital with his wife&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Mary was going to visit her sick father, so I can square off this penalty notice&rdquo;.  That has happened time and time again, over a decade after decade.  Was it abused?  It probably was, because we have a culture in Ireland where there is perhaps some favouritism shown to some people, such as to the monsignor, the county hurler or whomever.  That was wrong but, in general, the principle of discretion has worked for many years in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been effective and fair.<\/p> <p> In recent years, however, we have seen a form of a witch hunt or a McCarthyism of sorts.  The Limerick division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has looked closely at the squaring of fines.  While it is right to look at a practice, in the Limerick division there are now eight garda&iacute; who have been suspended right back since 2018.  Some 150 garda&iacute; within the division and in the neighbouring divisions have been questioned.  The personal phone devices of 60 garda&iacute; have been confiscated.  While this was done to try to straighten practice and do the right thing, it actually made a witch hunt of the entire exercise.  I am not here to be judge or jury, but I am privy to enough to know that this is not sufficiently progressing through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Garda Commissioner.  There a many cogs in this wheel that are slowing this investigation down.  It has taken eight garda&iacute; off the street.  It is has brought many under a net of suspicion.  A cloud hangs over them.  They cannot progress in their careers.  Ultimately, the people are losing out .  The Limerick City division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which takes in a considerable part of County Clare and my own constituency, is the ultimate loser here.<\/p> <p> I do not think that model of policing that we have adopted from the PSNI works.  Again, it comes back to the principles of community policing and policing by consent.  We should have a really good look at that, rather than adopting this kind of McCarthyism that has existed for the last three years to everyone's detriment.<\/p> <p> To return to the PSNI and what we seek to emulate at times, we should also have a proper look at some senior management figures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is because we had a British Supreme Court ruling just seven or eight weeks ago in respect of the hooded men and into how the investigation into the torture of those men was suspended, and wrongly so.  That has been borne out in a state inquiry in the UK.  Yet, senior figures in the PSNI and in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na presided over that.   That matter needs to come under the lens.  People are having their contracts renewed or whatever, and that is fine, but we need to have a lens on this.  I will keep using the opportunities I have in this House to shine the light on it.  While I am not judge or jury, I can certainly see the process.  Everyone is entitled to be assumed to be innocent until proven guilty.  The process has dragged far too many people into a net of suspicion.  It is damaging to their lives, to their mental well-being and to that of their families and to their communities.  It needs to be brought to a head.  I ask here on the floor of the D&aacute;il tonight that Commissioner Harris, whose contract has been renewed until 2025, will now take the initiative to progress this and bring it to the conclusion to which it needs to be brought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600054#HHH00200","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645033920,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is important legislation.  As we know, whistleblowing is an essential mechanism for exposing and stopping wrongdoing.  We should do everything that we can possibly do to protect whistleblowers.  As the health spokesperson for my party, I have seen far too many whistleblowers in the area of health come forward to expose wrongdoing.  They have exposed horrific abuse and neglect, such as what happened in the context of CAMHS in Kerry in recent times.  There have been so many examples of whistleblowers coming forward in the Department of Health and in health more generally.  In the vast majority of cases, they have not been protected.  In fact, they have become victims of the system.  Very often, we quite rightly talk about the lack of accountability and transparency that exist in the Department of Health.  I often say that if Pontius Pilate was alive and well and living in Ireland, he would probably be running the HSE.  This is because it seems to me that in healthcare everybody washes their hands of responsibility.  Senior management does not take responsibility.  When good people, as we have seen in many cases, come forward to put important issues into the public domain, they then themselves become targets.  They themselves become a problem.  We saw it in more recent times when there were allegations that were subject to a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on databases of children with disabilities and autism.<\/p>  <p> There is a long list.  I do not have the time to go through the long list of all of those cases of abuse and of neglect.  Some of them were well articulated in this Chamber before Christmas.  As we know, many of them are horrific.  On the one hand, there are victims of abuse, of neglect, of bad policies, of a lack of clinical oversight and of a failure arising from a culture of unaccountability within the HSE and the healthcare systems.  On the one hand, there are these victims and, on the other, there are people who come forward to blow the whistle on what is happening and who then become victims.<\/p>  <p>  While I want to give the Minister credit where I can, I also have to be honest and say that the reason why we are actually debating this is because it transposes a new European minimum standards policy.  This is not necessarily because the Government was motivated to do it.  This State and this Government have much more to do to create a culture of accountability and transparency and to better protect whistleblowers when they come forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1645034520,"counter":394,"content":"<p>This is important legislation.  Insofar as it seeks to improve the whistleblower regime, its intentions seem laudable enough.  The provisions seeking to include volunteers, shareholders, those in administrative management or supervisory bodies, and those who have a work-based relationship that is yet to begin or who are involved in a recruitment process, all seem good.  The establishment of the office of the protected disclosures commissioner within the ombudsman seems a good thing, as does enhancing the protections for workers who suffer penalisation as a result of a disclosure by changing the burden of proof in civil proceedings.<\/p><p>However, Whistleblowers Ireland has made a number of criticisms of the Bill, of which officials are probably aware.  The first criticism is that legal cases, Clarke <i>v<\/i>. CGI Food Services Limited and Baranya <i>v.<\/i>Rosderra Meats Group Limited, established that the guidelines produced in 2015 regarding the operation of protected disclosures under the 2014 Act did not accurately reflect the law.  That is important because, at least according to the Whistleblowing International Network, it meant that many of the people who should have been afforded protection fell at the first hurdle, as the actual code of practice employers and others were using to operate the protected disclosures regime was inaccurate.  That is pretty elementary stuff.  The regulations flowing from the legislation should be accurate and should ensure that the intent of the law is given effect and that whistleblowers have the protections they are supposed to have.<\/p><p>The biggest concern I have, which is reflected by whistleblowers, is whether the protections under the 2014 Act worked at all.  Are they acted on?  Some people have asked about the private sector.  If a business has more than 50 employees, it has to have its own channels and the public sector has to have its own channels as well.  I am aware, anecdotally, of people who have attempted to make protected disclosures and they have gone absolutely nowhere.  Others have mentioned examples of that as well.  Nothing happens, or they make a protected disclosure, very little happens, and then they get thrashed for something completely different.  That is a classic tactic.  People make a protected disclosure about malpractice, maladministration or wrongdoing, and the next minute they are hauled up for something else.  Then it becomes about them and what they have done wrong because the management or some power that be has decided to thrash them, victimise them, blacklist them or whatever.  What are we going to do about that?  I am just not sure whether this legislation will address that problem.  It is a deep problem and I do not have all the answers.<\/p><p>There is a fundamental imbalance between workers and bosses.  That is just a fact.  In either the public or private sector, if somebody kicks up or calls their employer out on something, the instinct of most senior management is to go for them because they are afraid that it could reflect badly on them, that the buck might stop with them or that they could be held accountable.  How do we deal with that fundamental imbalance of power?  I want to hear the Government explain how that is going to happen.<\/p><p>I would not mind some hard facts on this matter.  Maybe they are available.  I am not on the relevant committee, so I apologise if there are a lot of hard facts available on this.  I would like to know the details of what has happened with protected disclosures in the public and private sectors.  How many disclosures were made?  How many were upheld?  How many went nowhere?  Are these facts and statistics available so we can assess the extent to which the legislation had any effect whatsoever?<\/p><p>It seems to me that, broadly speaking, we need genuinely independent and well-resourced people to oversee this.  That is why I welcome the office of the protected disclosures commissioner and the ombudsman.  They are needed in order to make sure that whistleblowers are actually protected, that the protected disclosures or allegations of wrongdoing they make with regard to public or private bodies are treated seriously and are fully investigated, and that people are held accountable if those investigations discover that there was merit or validity to those allegations.  Maybe the person was just raising legitimate concerns.  They may not have been absolutely correct because these things are not always black and white.  Where someone has genuine concerns about things that are going on and has made a complaint, even if everything they said did not turn out to be true, if those concerns were legitimate they should be protected and the matter investigated.  They should not suffer retaliation, either directly or indirectly.  There has to be some mechanism for dealing with that because when management or higher-ups retaliate, they do not do it directly.  They do not say they are going to sack someone or blacklist them because they made a protected disclosure.  Of course they would not do that.  They go for them in other ways, usually by trying to fit them up for something or label them as a troublemaker or vexatious.<\/p><p>What happens to people who feel there is wrongdoing, malpractice, abuse or whatever it might be in a particular industry where the conditions of the workers are deeply precarious?  Does this legislation deal with such situations?  These people may not even have an employment relationship with the people who are abusing them but they may be part of an abusive industry or sector.  Today we heard from representatives of performers in the arts, such as comedians and so on, who appeared before the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  There have been similar allegations from people in the trad music scene.  These people are self-employed lone traders - sole traders, essentially - but in reality they are dependent for their employment on a relatively small group of people in the arts and culture sector, many of whom are funded by the State and get public money.  These people have described a culture of fear in the sector.<\/p> <p>I have heard it repeatedly from actors, musicians and all sorts of people working in the arts that if you speak up about abuse, malpractice or whatever, that phrase you will never work in this town again is often used.  That is the way it works.  What are we going to do about that?  Is that covered and how will we vindicate it  to make sure that it is effective?  Certainly, that sort of thing is widespread.<\/p> <p> I would like to know how can we address the following issue, which I have raised in other forums.  In some cases, the employer denies that they are the employer even though they are.  It is bogus self-employment.  What rights do you have if you are being misclassified as a contractor when, in fact, you are not a contractor?  You are an employee and you should have the rights of an employee but this is a way of the employer denying their responsibility to you as an employee.  Therefore, if you make a complaint, they do not have to process it because they are not your employer.  We need to address that.<\/p> <p> A particular egregious example that I have raised many times here is going on in the film industry.  I do not know how many times I have raised it with the Departments of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and Finance, where allegations have been made by film crew that the section 481 tax relief is being abused.  When they went into a joint Oireachtas committee in January 2018 and made these allegations, guess what happened?  They never worked in this town again, having worked for decades in the film industry.  The names of some of these people are on the credits of films over the past 20 years but they will never working in this town again after they came into an Oireachtas committee.  What is interesting about this example is that all film productions in this country are funded with public money and they are conditional on giving quality employment and training.  You are only supposed to get the relief if you provide quality employment and training as a result.  Under EU directives, you are also supposed to create a permanent pool of skills in that sector.  Notwithstanding the fact that film-making can be somewhat episodic, you are supposed to have rights and you are supposed to have rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, which deals with people who are in these situations of episode-to-episode type employment.  You accumulate rights of service under the law, but what happens in this instance is that when workers make complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, that their rights are not being respected, the film producers, who get the public money conditional on the provision of quality employment and training, go into the WRC and say that not only are they not the employer of this person even though they were the producer on the film on which the person worked but, in fact, they could not possibly have an employment relationship with him or her.  They are saying this in the WRC as we speak, and they have said it repeatedly.  Representatives of Screen Producers Ireland, which also gets public funding, collects the money from Revenue for providing quality employment and training and then, when the crew who are employed on these films make complaints, say that they could not possibly have an employment relationship with them and it is the nature of their industry that they do not have employees.  If you say anything, you will never work in this town again.  How are we going to deal with that?<\/p> <p> I am putting those points out there because I think they are relevant.  I am not saying I have all the answers but I think they need to be addressed.  You can have all sorts of laws, intentions and all the rest of it but it is no good unless they are actually to be enforced, unless there is a mechanism to enforce them and unless there is a mechanism to stop the abuses.<\/p> <p> The nature of the sort of abuses we are talking about, when we are talking about the things that whistleblowers bring up and the retaliation they face, is such that there is an in-built power imbalance.  Usually, it is people in powerful positions against whom the complaints are being made who obviously have no interest in acknowledging the truth of those allegations and who, in fact, have a vested interest in thrashing the reputation, and often the livelihoods and lives, of the people who make those protected disclosures.<\/p> <p> I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.  I would be particularly interested in and keen to see the statistics and the facts on the operation and effectiveness of the 2014 legislation.  If they are available, the Minister of State might letting me know where.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600056#KKK00100","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645035120,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  I commend the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on its work on the pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill and the various recommendations that came from that committee.  In his response, I ask the Minister to deal with each and every recommendation so that we know what the standing of the Department is in relation to the report and to the recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I want to put on record too that there have been many whistleblowers down through the years.  The one who should have been listened to at the time of the financial crash was Mr. Jonathan Sugarman.  Mr. Sugarman came forward and did what was expected of him in accordance with the legislation and reported to the Central Bank.  No one from the State has ever commented positively in relation to Mr. Sugarman but when you examine his case, you will see that as a whistleblower he was poorly served by the State.  As a Member of this House and Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, I thank Mr. Sugarman for coming forward and for doing what he thought was right.  It was right as it was within the law.  I condemn the authorities around that case which did not take the appropriate action and did not give Mr. Sugarman the type of respect and protection that he required at that time under law.  That is what happens to whistleblowers.  The whistleblower makes the complaint and then he or she becomes the victim.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Maurice McCabe is someone else who blew the whistle extensively.  Luckily for Mr. McCabe, he had a strong wife and family who saw him through that crisis.  What the State did to Mr. McCabe was a shocking example of how it can beat up its own citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, we debated the Grace case in this House.  It is interesting to note that the whistleblower in that case lost her job.  She is no longer employed in the agency that she was in.  It is also a terrible reflection on the State that the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, would say that there are no prosecutions to be taken against agencies or individuals relevant to Grace and, indeed, the 47 others.  What an absolute disgrace that is.  In some way, that office must be held responsible in the course of our work in this House.  I would ask the Ceann Comhairle, which I did in writing, to bring forward some method by which that can be discussed here because it certainly does not make sense that the whistleblower would be fired and no one will pay a price in the courts for what happened to the woman who was not able to express herself in any way and was mentally and physically challenge.<\/p>  <p>  If you think it has gone away now - the 2014 Bill deals with everything else - you could not be more incorrect.  At present, Gaisce, an agency funded by the State, is paying significant sums in legal fees to defend a position it holds on an employee, which is indefensible.<\/p> <p>There is no defence for what it is doing, but yet it is doing the usual thing the State does, which is pushing an individual to the pin of their collar and breaking the individual and their family.<\/p> <p> I have raised the case of CIT in the House numerous times and will continue to do so because it is an example of the bad legacy of the past being brought into the new structures for the present and for the future.  A whistleblower there went to mediation and is now being hung out to dry.  I have appealed to the Minister, the Taoiseach and others to please intervene and get it sorted but nothing has happened.  That, too, is a shame.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to Noel McGree, who is a whistleblower.  He won his case and is still being challenged by the Department of Justice.  On the day that we are discussing the introduction of this Bill there are people out there who have been treated in an horrendous way by the State, and the State continues to treat them in this way.  It begs the question as to where the political leadership is that will turn around to those who are causing the difficulty for the individuals and say: \"Stop, you are not doing this in the name of the Government.  You are to treat these people fairly and honourably, and in the way described in the existing legislation or according to the new legislation we are discussing today.\"<\/p> <p> Seanie O'Brien is another man who was badly treated by the State and the Prison Service.  He and his family ended up broken and no effort is being made to reach out to him.<\/p> <p> John Barrett blew the whistle in the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of the Garda, the numbers and what was happening there.  He lost his job.  He is gone.  The same is true of Julie Grace in Galway.  She is another lady who came forward but the Minister will not deal with it.  The case has dragged on for years.<\/p> <p> It is the same with Shane Kavanagh and the EBS in the private sector.  He and others are out of a job and the EBS will not respond to them.<\/p> <p> Lucia O&rsquo;Farrell's son was murdered on the road, but in terms of whistleblowing, she has outlined as part of her investigation the failure of the State in relation to the DPP, the Garda, the courts and so on.  It would be a great exercise for the State if it were to examine the case.  We passed a motion in this House in the previous D&aacute;il for a tribunal of sorts to be put in place to deal with the case but, typical of the political system, we do one thing in opposition and another thing in government.<\/p> <p> I will finish on this point in terms of the generality of the Bill, the Departments have insisted on putting in place confidentiality clauses which prevent the State and us from learning from the failures of the State.  I asked the Minister to tell me how many Departments have insisted on confidentiality clauses and what the cases were settled for, because the Government is conning the people and we need to know the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600057#LLL00200","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645035720,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I will follow on from Deputy McGuinness's remarks.  We welcome anything that will improve the situation for whistleblowers and people who make protected disclosures.  So many have had negative experiences.  I have dealt with many people in those circumstances.  I have spoken to people who have horrific stories to tell of situations that are happening in Departments in different parts of the country.  They want to come forward and talk about it, but they have seen how others are treated and they will not do it.  They come to Deputies and whisper about it.  We do not know the truth or otherwise of what they tell us, but we trust that they are telling us the truth and we report it.  Naturally enough, because we are not the core source, nothing happens.  It is a continuous situation, and we are never going to get any sense of justice in this country as long as that is going on.<\/p>  <p>  Maurice McCabe was the big example and John Wilson, and others were in a similar situation.  They put their heads on the block and they were ostracised by their colleagues for so doing.  A rat nailed to the door was done not just to them but to hundreds of others in similar circumstances around the country in various employments, often for the State as well as for other bodies outside of the State, in private industry.  The banking service was one of the big areas where an awful lot of that sort of thing happened.  You turned a blind eye and were loyal to the firm even though you knew what was going on was wrong.  If you said anything about it, you were in trouble.  That is the situation we must get to grips with.  There seems to be a problem in that regard.  As long as we allow it to go on in State institutions, then how can we possibly tackle it in private institutions?  We cannot.  While this legislation is welcome, I am very doubtful that it will change one thing in this State because there is no will among the senior people in any of the Departments to change it.<\/p>  <p>  A garda told me once that he reported a particular situation to a chief superintendent.  The chief superintendent called him to one side and said: \"Don't mess with city hall.\"  That was it.  He said: \"Drop it, or we'll be sending you to some far end of the country and there you'll stay.\"  There are thousands of magnificent people in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who do their very best all the time, but the notion that they have to be loyal to each other, even beyond the public good, is a big problem in that organisation.  I know work is being done in that regard and there is legislation being drafted, but until the culture changes, we have got a big problem.  When that is the situation in the institution that is at the coalface of delivering justice, what is it like in other institutions and organisations?  I welcome the legislation.  We need to do more in this field, but I am completely at a loss as to how it will change unless heads are going to roll at the very top of many of the organisations in this country.  I do not see that happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600058#MMM00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1645035720,"counter":399,"content":"<p>While the provisions of this Bill are to be welcomed, I have concerns over the exclusion of a number of elements of the recommendations of the finance committee, especially the retrospective elements.  We sat on the committee week after week, and we listened carefully to what was said by a string of whistleblowers who testified before us.  Some of them have had their lives ruined due to their experiences.  I have spoken to many whistleblowers who have lost marriages, families, jobs, pensions and homes.  Being a whistleblower in this State is a job of enormous personal cost in many situations.  I struggle to think of a particular case where it did not involve some significant personal cost to an individual.  A few were former public servants.  Where whistleblowers suffer a loss, they deserve compensation for the loss.  The wording of this Bill has omitted to make elements of it retrospective.<\/p>  <p>  There is a tendency on the part of the Government when it comes to EU directives or legislation to be very slow to amend or change it.  The recommendations of the finance committee seek to strengthen the Bill.  Surely, as an independent country, we are not locked into delivering only what Europe tells us to do.  Surely, we can strengthen any directive to make it better.  The recommendations of the finance committee do not seek to water down or weaken the Bill but seek to enhance it.  That includes the retrospective element.<\/p>  <p>  I have dealt with many whistleblowers over the years who have sacrificed much to expose wrongdoing.  The State's attitude towards whistleblowers leaves an enormous amount to be desired.  In many cases, whistleblowers have had mud slung at them by the State and that mud has stuck.<\/p>  <p>The reputations of whistleblowers have been damaged even by Governments in the past.  I have heard Ministers in this Government contradict outright the facts that have been brought to them.  It is very common for a State agency to call a whistleblower a liar, to imply they are mad or, worse still, in a famous case, to make accusations of child sexual abuse against the whistleblower.  In the case of CervicalCheck, we know the State tried to gag Vicky Phelan with regard to a non-disclosure agreement.<\/p> <p> In a recent case that I raised, Ms R received an apology, thankfully, from Tusla after having a number of inaccurate statements made about her on her file.  The Tusla file said, among other things, that she was an alcoholic, that Tusla had met with her son and that her son had expressed that he did not wish to return to his mother.  Ms R rigorously fought for the rights of her son and her good name.  She fought like any mother would fight.  Tusla has now conceded that Ms R was not an alcoholic and that the alleged meeting between her son and Tusla never actually took place.  It is phenomenal stuff that happened and Tusla has apologised to her.<\/p> <p> I asked the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth when he first became aware of these untruths on the file.  He said he only became aware of the issues when a politician contacted him on 16 March 2021.  However, Ms R has shown my office emails that she sent to the Minister five months prior to that date.  When I raised that discrepancy with the Minister in the D&aacute;il, having the documents to hand, he still denied that he knew about it at the time.  In effect, the Minister was calling Ms R a liar, even in the face of documentary evidence.<\/p> <p> Over a year ago, I had a meeting with CervicalCheck to discuss the various concerns I had about that particular scandal.  At the meeting, the clinical director of CervicalCheck told me in no uncertain terms that it was her view that the courts were wrong to rule in favour of women such as Vicky Phelan, the late Patricia Carrick, Ruth Morrissey and Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  CervicalCheck told me that these women were not wronged - an incredible situation.  When I told the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health about these comments, the Minister said this was not the case.  Again, in effect, the Government was calling me a liar in regard to a meeting that I was involved in, where I took notes and when my parliamentary assistant was also there.<\/p> <p> On another occasion, I tried to raise in this House concerns about the Covid-19 outbreak in a nursing home in Galway, where the nursing home had asked the HSE for staffing support but had been left abandoned.  The Minister responded to me: &ldquo;That is a flat-out lie.&rdquo;  My source of information was a distraught manager in the nursing home, a report on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Today with Claire Byrne&rdquo; and the local GP, Dr. Martin Daly, who was of course a former president of the IMO.  A month later, I secured documents under freedom of information from the HSE which confirmed not only the veracity of the story, but also that the Minister for Health had been briefed about the situation by the HSE prior to him levelling an accusation against me for lying in the D&aacute;il about it, the report on the Claire Byrne show, the nursing home manager and Dr. Daly reporting on it.<\/p> <p> We have had a lot of discussion in recent weeks about the Brandon report and the disability services.  It was brought to light by Deputy Pringle and a whistleblower who was in touch with him.  The manner in which the State treated not only the whistleblower but also Deputy Pringle is, I believe, shameful.  One of the contributions is a mirror image of the issue I have just raised with regard to Tusla files.  A dispute arose over the content of documentation that Deputy Pringle had furnished the review panel with and, in effect, the Deputy was made to look like a liar.<\/p> <p> We all recall the powerful contribution of Deputy John McGuinness on the Grace case and he is to be commended on the work he did on that issue.  It is my understanding and it has been reported that, behind the scenes, the Taoiseach has criticised the Deputy for his contribution on that.  If the State, civil servants and Government Ministers can smear Opposition Deputies or backbenchers like this, God knows what else is happening to whistleblowers behind the scenes.<\/p> <p> This legislation is welcome but there is a need for a change of culture in this State.  The trouble is that nearly every organisation, be it a political, State or civil society organisation, seems to have an instinct that its job is to protect itself against those who are simply seeking to out grave wrongs.  I can understand why an organisation would want to protect itself against vexatious allegations and so on, but when an individual seeks to highlight and out grave wrongs, the culture of that organisation should not be defensive.  The culture of that organisation should seek to empower that individual to help to reform the organisation.  I know for a fact that even political parties in this Chamber strongly have that instinct of defence against the greater good.  That culture has to change in here.  I have spent ten years in Leinster House and I have heard people from all sides of the D&aacute;il calling for reform.  Some of the simplest reform that can be achieved in Leinster House is from the political class itself.  There is no evidence within this Government, since it took office in 2020, that there is a political desire for reform of itself.  The legislation is welcome but it is wholly useless unless Government Ministers adopt a policy of legislating and of listening to whistleblowers, and desist from pushing back against them.  The culture of organisations has to change, including in this House.  I think there will be many Deputies and Ministers who will vote for this legislation tonight who have previously been involved in pushing back against whistleblowers in their attempt to protect their reputation.  Such hypocrisy has to be called out.  We need systemic change, not just in this legislation but also in how this Government operates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600058#MMM00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645036320,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smith, on bringing it forward.<\/p>  <p>  Back in 2014, the Houses of the Oireachtas decided to enact legislation that would provide a statutory protection to whistleblowers, and they were whistleblowers who came from within the public sector.  It was very important legislation that we introduced and enacted in this House.  It is also important to recall that it was enacted not in response to any European Council directive, but it was decided to introduce it because it was thought necessary from the point of view of issues that we faced in this country.  Obviously, the legislation which is before the House this evening and yesterday is slightly different because we are transposing an Council directive, but we are also getting an opportunity to make some important changes to the protected disclosures law which I believe will improve it.<\/p>  <p>  The State should not be afraid to enable individuals within the State or employees in the private sector to come forward to disclose wrongdoing or a failure to comply with legal obligations.  It is the case that when we look at the legislation, wrongdoing is described in very broad terms.  It is not just the commission of a criminal offence, as many people think, but it also can be the failure or inadequacy of a statutory body to fulfil a statutory and legal obligation.  The State should be prepared to acknowledge that this is an important function that is being performed by individuals within the public sector.  The legislation before us will also extend to private entities, provided there are more than 50 employees.<\/p>  <p>  It is to the benefit of the State if it is established, and there are mechanisms in place to establish, that wrongdoing exists either within the public sector or private sector.  Similarly, it has to be to the benefit of the State and the private sector if allegations of wrongdoing are made, if they are adequately investigated and if it is found that such allegations are not substantiated.  We all know that it cannot be the case that every whistleblower is correct in the allegations they make.  We talk in this House about whistleblowers who we commend and who have done a very honourable job in disclosing wrongdoing, and they have been mentioned in the House this evening.  I obviously support and recognise that.  However, it is also the case that there are allegations that can be made which should be investigated but that investigation may not establish the allegations that have been made by the whistleblower.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the fact the legislation that has been in place since 2014 is extremely complicated and difficult to navigate.  I know that because, as a Deputy, I was the recipient of a protected disclosure, along with a retired colleague in this House.  It was a perfectly valid protected disclosure which was made under the provisions of section 17 of the 2014 Act.  I can tell the House it was a very demanding process but we were able to ensure that the whistleblowers and the serious allegation they were reporting to us were brought to the attention of the State and necessary changes were made.  They were the only two whistleblowers who came directly to me and I have to say, on the record of the D&aacute;il, that they were extremely honourable, commendable people.<\/p> <p>The public and the public service were improved by the disclosure they made.  However, under the 2014 legislation there is a myriad of avenues down which a protected disclosure must go for it to be appraised and assessed.  That is why I welcome the fact that under this legislation we will set up the office of the protected disclosures commissioner.  That would provide a much more simple method for protected disclosures to be made and investigated in a thorough and coherent fashion.<\/p> <p> There are also a number of important provisions within the Bill that are to the great assistance of whistleblowers.  For instance, the Minister has introduced a provision in section 22 whereby the burden of proof in tort claims brought by a whistleblower who claims he or she has suffered damage as a result of making the protected disclosure is to be reversed.  The reversal of a burden of proof in litigation is a significant matter.  It does not frequently happen but the basis on which it can happen is if a statute provides for it.  I commend the Minister on introducing this provision in the Bill.  It will give significant protection to whistleblowers if they are subjected to detrimental contact as a result of having made a protected disclosure.  It will mean that when they bring a case against their employer or the person who has subjected them to detriment, they will be able to say to the court that since they suffered detriment the court must assume that is because of the protected disclosure that has been made.  After that it will be for the employer to put forward evidence to prove that was not the case.<\/p> <p> The Bill is worthwhile and it is important that the office of the protected disclosures commissioner be well-resourced.  It is also important that individuals in the public sector and in the private sector, if they qualify, are aware of the role that office can play.  It is extremely important that the State is not embarrassed or hesitant about facing up to the fact that there will be wrongdoing within the State.  How we respond to that is important.  The fact that we are improving legislation to ensure that wrongdoing can be investigated thoroughly shows that the State is not embarrassed or trying to hide away from the reality of the fact that there will be circumstances where wrongdoing takes place.  It is also beneficial to have a coherent one-stop shop for the investigation of that wrongdoing so it can be done in a much more expeditious way.  It is clearly in the public interest and for the public benefit for allegations of wrongdoing that turn out to be true to be established.  Similarly, it is clearly in the public interest and for the public benefit if it can be established that allegations of wrongdoing turn out to be false.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600059#NNN00200","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645036920,"counter":403,"content":"<p>According to the ODCE, whistleblowing is among the most effective means of exposing and remedying corruption and other types of wrongdoing in the public and private sectors.  Many cases of corruption and fraud that have been highlighted and that we know of today have been exposed because of the actions taken by workers who reported the issues to their employers, regulators and press and who essentially became whistleblowers.  We owe those people who have come forward to date and those who will come forward in the future a debt of gratitude for exposing that wrongdoing, while they know and have seen others in similar situations face such a backlash.  Yet they still take that moral path in exposing it.  When a whistleblower revealed wrongdoing in the past the primary concern of authorities was too often focused on limiting their own reputational damage, casting aspersions on his or her motivations and circling the wagons in strategic retaliation.  We have seen whistleblowers suffer horrendous blowback for acting in the public interest and that is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  We are debating this Bill because of the EU whistleblowing directive but at this point the legislation was overdue a review and it needed to be updated.  When it comes to protecting whistleblowers, after they expose the wrongdoing the full support of legislation should be behind them and they should not have the full weight of the arms of the State come down on them.  A wrong being further compounded by another wrong is reflective of a society that is not willing to look at itself and listen when there is an issue in an area and then take effective action to ensure that does not replicate itself in other areas.  Others have spoken about the cultures within organisations and while we cannot legislate for culture, we can legislate for a mechanism that ensures organisations look at themselves in an open and transparent manner.  Instead of the first step being aggressive and hostile towards whistleblowers, they should be willing to take on board that criticism and ensure it is rectified as they move forward into another area.  That modernisation of legislation on protected disclosures will be so important because we want to see corruption tackled and we do not want to see it replicated.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the hard work done by my colleagues, Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Pat Buckley, who introduced legislation last year to amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  I urge the Minister to take on board parts of that Private Members' Bill that would amount to significant and much-needed change.

As he knows, this amending Bill is long overdue and there are huge issues.  I will stick to the Department of Justice and the protected disclosures procedure within the Irish Prison Service.  The Minister responded to a parliamentary question last week and I am aware that there are huge concerns regarding procedures within the Irish Prison Service.  She stated in her reply that Irish Prison Service's protected disclosures policy outlines &quot;the protections and supports available for staff who make protected disclosures and those involved in the investigation of a protected disclosure&quot;.  She went on to state: &quot;My Department and the Prison Service have engaged independent [and private] investigators to examine the majority of the disclosures and to report to the disclosers on the findings.&quot;  Two such independent reports by Judge William Earley and by McCann FitzGerald LLP found that those making a protected disclosure were not supported or protected and that the Irish Prison Service was not implementing its protected disclosure policy and was not protecting those who make protected disclosures.  These findings were furnished to the Minister for Justice, which is alarming in this day and age.  In her response to me, she explained:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere are dedicated units in my Department and in the Prison Service to liaise directly and in a confidential manner with disclosers.  The Prison Service has provided training to staff on Protected Disclosures and Dignity at Work policies and procedures and it is planned that further training will be provided going forward. [That is lovely and dandy in print but it is not happening.]<br \/><br \/>Employees of the Prison Service are encouraged to avail [according to the Minister] of the support services available.  These include the HR Governors and Staff Support Officers at the prison locations. <\/blockquote>  <p>I am concerned about the Minister&rsquo;s response, advising those seeking support to speak to the HR governor.  One HR governor was interviewed by the independent external investigator, McCann FitzGerald LLP, and in his testimony, which is provided in the final report, he stated that he has received no training in protected disclosures and that he believed he has no remit regarding protected disclosures.  What is going on then?  It is shocking that he believes he has no role in this regard.  Can the Minister explain what support this provides?<\/p><p>The original Act has been described as weak and deficient and I agree with that analysis, which is why this amending Bill is here.  People have suffered as a result of those weaknesses and deficiencies.<\/p> <p>Will the amendments that the Minister is making be made retrospective to provide remedy for those who continue to seek justice under the original Act?  I doubt it but I am calling for that because it should be thus.  Given that an independent report has said that the law was weak and ineffective, it is essential that the amendments to the original Act are made retrospective to support those who made protected disclosures under the original Act.<\/p> <p> The manner in which protected disclosures are dealt with by the Irish Prison Service must be seriously reviewed.  I am in receipt of numerous reports of bullying and intimidation of staff right across the service but the manner in which complaints are managed is not appropriate by any yardstick and often leads to further bullying, intimidation and victimisation of staff.  These matters must be dealt with because we are in a serious and perilous situation.  Lives have almost been lost.  People have nearly been driven to suicide.  I have met these people -  their families have been intimidated, threatened and abused.  It is shocking that this could go on in a modern democracy, 100 years after celebrating our so-called freedom.  These people have worked hard to provide good service to the State and to be bullied and intimidated like that is totally unacceptable.  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, as the saying goes, and something is definitely rotten in the Irish Prison Service.  The legislation the Minister is bringing forward is totally inadequate.  If we do not learn from the mistakes of the past, we have no hope going forward.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose bona fides I respect, to do something.  The Minister of Justice reads out replies to me which are just a smokescreen and a cover-up because there are no services there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600060#OOO00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645037520,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The general scheme of the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2021 was published last summer in advance of the 17 December deadline for transposition of EU Directive 2019\/1937, known as the whistleblowing directive, into Irish law.  However, the 17 December 2021 deadline has been missed by over two months at this stage.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether any fines have been issued by the Commission and if so, the cost of any such fines to the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  People have come to me from big organisations like the HSE, the Irish Prison Service, the Department of Defence and others and the stories they have told would make one's blood boil.  While they could prove what they were saying, speaking out was not worth the potential financial cost and the risk of losing their job or their pension.  The threats against them and their families made it too dangerous for them to speak out.  We are all aware of the corruption that goes on in large companies, both private and public.  Corruption can involve some of the most powerful people in powerful jobs and what they can do to the man or woman who is trying to do a day's work is frightening.  The damage that can be done is insurmountable.  I could go into a lot more detail but I will stop here to avoid any conflict for these people.<\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of clarity, it is important that the Minister states whether the burden of proof will rest on the individual whistleblower or on the organisation.  The hundreds of people who unleash the truth and speak out deserve to be mentioned here today.  Their actions are patriotic and brave.  All those who speak out against wrongdoing do so in the public interest.  Such actions should always be encouraged and never discouraged in any way.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will further extend the scope and breadth of the protections afforded to individuals who make a protected disclosure in Ireland.  While this is to be welcomed, it is disappointing that it has taken the Government so long to bring this legislation before the House.  At present, the burden of proof in cases of penalisation under the Act rests with the person alleging the wrongdoing.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform previously indicated plans to reverse this burden of proof, meaning that the penalisation would be presumed to have occurred upon the making of a protected disclosure unless the employer could prove otherwise.  However, the Bill makes no provision for this expected change.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to state that if a person is retaliated against for speaking out, he or she has the right to a remedy under Ireland's protected disclosure law but the process is not straightforward.  In cases of reprisal that do not involve dismissal, the burden of proof is on the whistleblower to demonstrate that the only reason this happened is because he or she spoke out.  This is difficult to prove because an organisation can often find other reasons for behaviour that seems to be retaliatory, or at least enough to cast a doubt.  This burden of proof represents a significant obstacle.  Whistleblowers rarely have the financial resources to compete with corporate legal teams.  This is why many cases taken under the 2014 Act have not succeeded.<\/p>  <p>  There is no point in tarring everyone with the same brush.  There are great working relationships out there but some situations are shocking.  One workplace that has been mentioned a lot today is the Irish Prison Service.  It is time that the cap is taken off here and the muzzle is taken off too.  People who have been wronged need to be able to have recourse to justice.  They need to be able to put things right.  It took many years for some whistleblowers to get the State to sit up and listen.  If some of the things I have heard, and I am sure other Deputies have heard too, are true and valid, which I believe they are, it would shock the nation to its core as to what is going on in some places.  I hope this legislation will help in some way to ease the burden on people and enable them to come forward.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said earlier, some of these people are suicidal.  As a State, we must strongly stand behind these people.  We must give them their right to speak and the right to have the wrongs that have been done to them for decades put right.  I recently spoke to a person at great length about the difficulties he has gone through.  It is astonishing to think that he has no safety mechanism to allow him to disclose what he has been through in his life to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600061#PPP00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1645037520,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Tonight is a very important night.

They were standing up for something they believed in.  They believed they were telling the truth but in many cases, that truth was not welcomed by anybody; not by people within the organisations they were working in or even by the general public.

Employers should ensure that their protected disclosures policy expressly acknowledges that such grievances will be dealt with under business grievance procedures.  I highlight this because it is important that the water is not muddied with regard to what is what.  As far as I can see, this Bill clearly defines what a protected disclosure should be, how feedback is to be provided to the reporting person, what actions are taken or envisaged to be taken, with a follow-up within three months.  All of those systems that are being put in place are important. <\/p>  <p>  A new office of a protected disclosures commissioner will be established within the Office of the Ombudsman which will receive and redirect to the most suitable authority, as appropriate, the protected disclosures made to the prescribed person under section 7 of the Act and to the Minister under section 8 of the Act.  <\/p> <p>In cases where there is no alternative suitable authority, the commissioner will follow up directly on the disclosures referred to the office.  Again, people have to see that this Bill will actually help them with their grievances.  New offences will be created for employers who fail in their obligations to establish internal reporting channels and for the person who penalises the reporting of persons to hinder or attempt to hinder a person from making a report or taking vexatious proceedings against reporting persons.  Of course that is important but we do not want it to be seen as a witch-hunt against employers.  Employers are very important for us.  They are the people who create business and work.  We want fairness and to make sure that when there is an issue the employers will understand their duties and obligations.  That is why it is very important that the employers understand the Bill.  That is their duty.  Behind it all, it is all for their protection too.  If they look at it properly, employers will see that it is not a case of \"us against them\" or \"you against me\" or anything like that but simply that there is a right and wrong way to carry out one's work whatever a person's role.  There is a right and wrong way to do it.  I am glad that this Bill will help make that clear and tidy it up.  That is why I am glad to welcome it and to speak in support of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600061#PPP00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645038120,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  I have a question for the Minister and would like a reply in writing if he does not mind.  It relates to HSE employees past and present.  I am very disturbed that within the HSE there is a Q-pulse system where staff can make complaints regarding wrongful practice.  How many Q-pulse cases have not been acted on and closed out in the HSE?  How many Q-pulse submissions have there been annually over the past ten years?  What percentage required significant action?  How many patients died or were significantly injured and seriously harmed, including preventable injuries, during surgery?  Will this Bill protect them?<\/p><p>University Hospital Limerick is required to ensure that serious reportable incidents are managed, reported and investigated within four months in line with the HSE safety incident management policy.  How many staff members have left their position or been forced out of their role or transferred to new locations within the hospital system?  How many have been promoted for their silence?  How many of their colleagues were demoted as a result?  How many had to sign non-disclosure agreements?<\/p><p>When this happens, staff are isolated and branded troublemakers even though they are just raising concerns within the hospital.  These issues have been raised across all positions in the hospital and across the whole UHL group.  Who is responsible for giving instructions for these cases not being examined?  The exit interviews in the HSE have highlighted so many issues within the hospital that are never acted on or followed up.  Under the new European directive wrong-doing must be investigated.  Diligent follow-up is required.<\/p><p>The new legislation is to ensure that there can be no penalties made against a whistleblower.  This is very difficult to prove, particularly when up against a significant corporation.  The burden of proof rests on the whistleblower who is often unable to take on the large organisation.  Being a whistleblower is a lonely and frightening road to take.  To date, whistleblowers have helped make Ireland a better and safer place to work.  There is a tremendous bravery and courage on the part of whistleblowers which needs to be recognised in this legislation.  These are people who are not afraid to tell the truth.  <\/p><p>In 2014 Professor Colette Cowen was asked to take up a position as a CEO by the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and Tony O'Brien.  Were the proper protocols followed?  She had been chief director of nursing and midwifery at the Western and North Hospital Group during the investigation of the death of Savita Halappanavar.  At the coroner's court in Galway, the coroner asked why the file had entries added after the case.  The coroner recommended: <\/p> <blockquote> \tNo additions should be made to the medical records of a deceased whose death is the subject of a coroner's inquiry.  Additions may inhibit the inquiry and prohibit the making of recommendations which may prevent further fatalities.  And that should be applied nationally. <\/blockquote>  <p>There are questions for the HSE workers.  Had the CEO been made aware of similar cases or been notified of tampering with records of patients' medical notes during the system analysed in the investigation in University Hospital Limerick when patients were harmed during procedures in the hospital?  On 29 May 2020 - I know the date because it was my 50th birthday - we were not permitted to have my birthday party with my family and friends.  However, on that day, there was a retirement party in UHL for Dr. Gerry Burke.  Professor Paul Burke, the CEO, Professor Cowen, and others attended.  There were no masks or 2 m distancing and no accountability or sanctions against management.  Photographs were posted on Twitter before being removed subsequently.  When Leo Varadkar was Minister he said that if managers did not do their job, heads would roll.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said that he would shine a light on management.  What about the CEOs?  He promised managers would be removed if they did not do their job.  What about CEOs?  How much is this management structure costing?  In the past ten years how many patients have died in County Clare and Tipperary due to the lack of an emergency department near them?  According to a study by the Department of Health, 1,000 people have died while being transported to UHL while they passed closed hospitals.  What price does this Government put on people's lives?  That is what I am asking.  I need to go on the record with this and I want an answer in writing from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600062#QQQ00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1645038120,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that it is not good practice to mention names.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600062#QQQ00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1645038120,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  I acknowledge that we would not be here today were it not for the Trojan work of my party colleagues, Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Buckley.  They brought forward the original Bill.  There are some flaws in the Government Bill which have been pointed out.  I ask the Minister to consider the changes put forward.<\/p>  <p>  For too long, people who have been brave enough to speak up in this State have been ignored or let down.  In my constituency I am helping a woman who has spoken out about her experience of domestic violence.  Her living situation is not safe and that needs to change.  However, local authorities seem to be at a loss when it comes to dealing with women in such situations.  Despite all the talk of domestic and gender-based violence, we do not always look at the whole effect that it has on a woman's life.  I am asking that consideration be given to providing every local authority with funding to employ a domestic violence officer who can provide trauma-informed care and support to those in situations like that of the lady I described.<\/p>  <p>  One issue that whistleblowers raise here time and again is the lack of transparency and accountability.  The Government's mishandling of the Keltoi rehab unit which was closed at the beginning of the pandemic and still closed today highlights a lack of transparency.  On the one hand, we have a Minister claiming it will be reopened and that there are plans in place to do so.  On the other the HSE confirmed only today that there are no plans to reopen it.  This was a trauma-informed facility.  It was the only one of its kind in the State with a world-standard wraparound care.  It needs to be reopened immediately.  In fact, more Keltois should be opened across the State.  There will be analysis of the consequences of Covid-19.  I have been told of people who have lost their lives because of the closure of Keltoi.<\/p> <p>It remains closed to this day.  I hope the truth will come out and be reported because the individuals who have died tragically, as well as their families, deserve answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600062#QQQ00400","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645038720,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022.  I support this Bill in part.  It is well needed and long overdue and I welcome the fact the Minister has said he is open to amendments to improve the Bill on Committee Stage if they can be put into operation and improve protections for whistleblowers.  There are amendments that should be made and Ministers should be open to Opposition input into legislation to strengthen it further.  However, I am incredibly disappointed that many whistleblowers have been left behind in this legislation due to the fact this Bill does not address existing protected disclosures made before this legislation came into existence.  While those disclosures may have preceded the Bill and it appears that is standard procedure in this House for why it cannot be retrospective, how the Bill is being dealt with and how the disclosures are being dealt with are ongoing and in many cases may not even have started.  They should therefore be benefiting from this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said, this Bill is long overdue and I recognise the only reason it has come into existence is so that we can give effect to the EU&rsquo;s directive on whistleblowing and mandatory reporting and not because the Government has any real want to improve current protected disclosures legislation.  However, I am supportive of any Bill that strives to protect those who are brave enough to speak up about wrongdoing, no matter how it comes into existence.  I recognise this Bill is a step in the right direction when it comes to establishing strong and effective laws for whistleblowers but we must recognise where it falls short.<\/p>  <p>  Whistleblowers get a very negative reaction in this country.  Maybe it is partly due to our colonial past and the fact authority is not really recognised.  It is the protection of authority that attacks whistleblowers.  The wrong protection of that authority and of wrongdoing pervade an awful lot of the structures in our society.  We must address it in some way.  It was shocking earlier to hear the Taoiseach ask, during Leaders' Questions, what we can do because it takes too long and why should we deal with anything because it takes too long and is too cumbersome.  We cannot continue on like that.  How can we improve our public services and how they work for us as citizens if we do not have effective ways for wrongdoing to be raised and addressed?  It is vitally important.  It is not enough for us to wring our hands and say we cannot do it and should not have to deal with it because it takes too long to deal with it.  There must be ways around that.  The Government should have the power to think about that and about ways to do that.  It needs to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 is very important and I am glad the Minister has taken into account the pre-legislative scrutiny from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach regarding the definitions used in the legislation, which widen the scope of those who are entitled to protection for whistleblowing.  This particularly relates to the definition of \"worker\".  I am glad this has been expanded to include job applicants, board members, shareholders and volunteers because it is important they are all taken into account.  Section 7 is also important in ensuring the identity of those who make anonymous disclosures are protected under the Act should their identity be discovered.<\/p>  <p>  It is great section 8 requires that private sector entities with 50 or more employees establish formal whistleblowing channels.  This is a very important and necessary step that would protect the whistleblower and create an environment in which it is safe for him or her to blow the whistle.  However, I wonder why this has been limited to organisations with more than 50 employees as, regardless of size, whistleblowing is necessary and important.  Many organisations with fewer than 50 employees could be very influential and account for much expenditure, money and indeed Government money as well, I assume, and so they should also be covered by the Act.  Surely every organisation should be required to establish formal whistleblowing channels, no matter their size.  We must strive to ensure we protect those who report wrongdoing, no matter the size of their organisation.  That is only right.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly welcome the inclusion of a required follow-up time, which is detailed in section 9.  The Bill would ensure all reports are acknowledged within seven days and followed up on within three months, and I support the establishment of very specific steps within clear timelines to follow-up in all other areas of reporting throughout all our Departments.  What is needed on that as well are effective remedies if matters are not followed up on and timelines missed.  It is about what happens then.  That is vitally important too because we have seen how reports are made and they just sit and gather dust.  Time goes on and the person is still having difficulties with the issue and it is not being dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  I note section 10 provides for the establishment of a new protected disclosures commissioner in the Office of the Ombudsman and section 12 sets out requirements for Ministers to transmit all reports they receive to the new protected disclosures commissioner.  I understand Ministers often feel they are limited in what they can do to follow up on reports, and that says much in itself.  I have experienced this myself with the Brandon report.  Under this new legislation the commissioner takes responsibility for directing reports to the most appropriate actor to address the matter, which will ensure an independent follow-up of disclosures sent to Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  Again, we need to be certain who that person is, namely, to whom the commissioner will actually send it on.  For example, a protected disclosure relating to the operations of the HSE cannot be sent to it for investigation.  It just cannot because I do not believe that organisation is willing to investigate anything related to it.  Thus, some effective person must be found to deal with those issues.  I am sure there are other such organisations; that is just what I am familiar with at the minute.  I am sure there are other organisations in the State equally culpable too.  I welcome this with caution and hope we ensure this office is resourced and run appropriately.  It will make a huge difference in the success or failure of this office and should be taken into consideration.  This has probably been addressed at committee but I would like to hear some more about what the projected costs of running that office are to ensure it is resourced properly.  That is vitally important.  To be effective, it must be resourced properly.<\/p>  <p>  Section 18 is another important section that provides for the restriction of certain data subject access rights to prevent the impediment of follow-ups or the abuse of whistleblower rights.  Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing illegality, corruption and wrongdoing in this country, and we must ensure, therefore, they are protected at all costs.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to what this Bill lacks, I am very disappointed it does not intend to make the new protections provided retrospective, which I addressed earlier.  The Bill does not address existing protected disclosures made before the legislation came into existence.  The committee heard from many of those who had already made protected disclosures during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  They described their experience of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and the negative impact it has had on their lives.  Those were telling contributions.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those whistleblowers for their bravery.  It is said more cases of corruption are exposed by whistleblowers than any other organisation and we must recognise the important role they play in our democracy.  That must be recognised and should be recognised into the future.  We need to make sure those who make disclosures in the future are not faced with the same negative experience and we also must ensure legacy cases are addressed in the legislation.  This Bill must not leave those whistleblowers behind.  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that all protected disclosures be included.<\/p>  <p>  This is an incredibly important Bill but we must ensure we get it right.  I welcome that the Minister is willing to make amendments on Committee Stage, but I urge him to take into consideration all protected disclosures, no matter when they were been made.  Whistleblowers have been failed time and again and we must ensure we do not continue to fail them in the future.  In its current form this legislation continues to fail them.  That is what will impede other whistleblowers in coming forward, and what we must ensure is they feel they can come forward.  It is the only way to make our democracy more accountable and the only way to make our public services, as well as the private sector, more accountable and work for the good of everybody rather than just a few.  That is what the import of this Bill should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600063#RRR00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1645038720,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I welcome the work done by the Department, the Minister and the committee on this legislation.  I can see from what I have read the amount of work that has gone into it and the consideration.  I welcome also that the Minister is open to all amendments, or all reasonable amendments.  Clearly, this Bill, as has been said so many times, provides for the transposition of the EU directive into Irish law.  That of course begs the question of why we had to wait for the directive.  There was a review in 2018 that was very helpful but that did not recommend any changes in the legislation.<\/p> <p>That is worrying for me.  I come back to the existing practices, procedures and policies on the ground that are not working generally.  That is why we need we need whistleblowing legislation, which is unfortunate.  The Minister is on record as saying, and I agree with him, that in an ideal society we would not need this at all, but I am afraid that is in heaven and not on earth.  The review that was carried out in 2018 did not recommend any changes.  Perhaps those who carried out the review were being cautious because they knew the EU directive was coming down the line.  I will accept the more benign reason for that. <br\/><br\/>I cannot remember if a review is built into this Bill.  It seems to me a review after two years is essential if we are seriously interested in strengthening whistleblowing legislation.  It has been said so often at this stage that the personal scope of the Bill has been extended to volunteers, unpaid trainees, board members, shareholders and job applicants.  I welcome that.  It places an obligation on all private organisations with 50 or more employees, which I also welcome, although there is a derogation.  On a practical level, I can see why there is an extension of time and I accept that.  I am not so sure why private companies with under 50 employees are not included because I understand this Bill includes such companies that are in the public sector.  I am not sure why that distinction is there.<br\/><br\/>I very much welcome the new office of the protected disclosures commissioner that will be established.  New offences are created for employers who fail in their obligations to establish the proper internal reporting channels; I welcome all of that.  It is positive that unauthorised disclosures of the identity of a reporting person will be a criminal offence.  The extension of the interim relief measures under the Act to include acts of penalisation other than dismissal is also welcome.  This is the one time I welcome the reversal of the burden of proof although recently, in a different context to do with refugees, I condemned the reversal of proof.  I welcome it in this situation, where it falls to the employer to provide that the alleged act of penalisation did not occur because someone made a protected disclosure.  I also welcome the emphasis on data collection.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Bill, but there is the dream and the reality.  The reality on the ground is so far removed from the dream.  To put it in perspective, where did the 2014 Act come from?  I paid tribute to Deputy Howlin in the past when he pushed that, but where did it come from?  It came from the Morris tribunal.  The last time I saw the cost of that tribunal it was &euro;70 million and rising.  As Deputy Pringle said, establishment Ireland wanted to believe the matter just related to Donegal.  That was the way we dealt with it.  As the cost of it rose by millions to more than &euro;70 million, it was said it could only happen in Donegal - I apologise to Deputy Pringle - but nowhere else.  It took more than &euro;70 million to realise that is not what happened.  The impetus for this Bill came from that.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Cullinane said he wished the impetus for this Bill did not come from an EU directive, which it did not.  It came from pain, suffering and the most appalling corruption in the Garda force in that area and, we subsequently learned, in other areas.  I again pay tribute to good members of the Garda on the ground, as I do to good politicians, but I do not think we can clap ourselves on the back for it, notwithstanding my praise for individual Deputies who pushed it and who were very good.  That was the Morris tribunal.  We have all the other background, including the Mahon tribunal, which started as the Flood tribunal.  I cannot remember the cost of that; it is just off the deep end.  We had the Moriarty tribunal on payments to politicians.  They are just a few of the tribunals.<br\/><br\/>If we had an environment in Ireland where people could come forward and be cherished, we would have saved a fortune, not to mention the pain and suffering.  I will refer to the Bill digest supplied by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service - I thank it for its great work - which states:<\/p><blockquote>\tAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ... whistleblowing is among the most effective means to [both] expose and remedy corruption, fraud, and other types of wrongdoing in the public and private sectors.  Whistleblowing has been a particularly valuable tool in the areas of environmental protection, [I hope Deputies will remember this when we are talking about planning laws and demonising environmental groups and courageous people on the ground] law enforcement, finance, education and healthcare. <\/blockquote> <p>It goes on to tell us:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere are also significant economic benefits to having a fully functional and comprehensive whistleblowing legislative framework.  For example, the European Commission's report &quot;Estimating the economic benefits of whistleblower protection in public procurement&quot; indicated that, in the EU [alone]...losses due to a lack of whistleblower protection in public procurement were estimated at between &euro;5.8 and &euro;9.6 billion [I had to read it twice]. <\/blockquote> <p>Transparency International tells us in its A Best Practice Guide for Whistleblowing Legislation:<\/p><blockquote>\t...[there are] three main reasons given by people for not reporting wrongdoing... [These are] fear of the consequences [that is] (legal, financial, [and] reputational), the belief that nothing will be done, that it will not make any difference [and] uncertainty about...[who], [and] where and to whom...[they should] report <\/blockquote> <p>Legislation must reflect that.  The Government has gone a long way to doing that, but the enforcement of legislation is the problem.  I have much trust in a constant review of the legislation so that we can learn.  If the Minister can reassure me that there will be a meaningful review of the legislation to see whether it is achieving its aims, I will be delighted.  Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about the facts earlier, which are missing here in respect of how many whistleblowers come forward, how they are treated, what their experience is, what we can learn and what money we can save as a result.  This is all very factual, practical stuff.  Where is the place we are doing all of that?  These are very important questions.<br\/><br\/>I am thinking of something I raised in the House recently, which is insignificant in the context of the major issues we have to deal with, such as housing and health.  The only thing the HSE in my area of Galway was interested in doing was finding out who was telling her.  If it is doing that for what I am describing as a relatively minor matter, what is it doing for more serious incidents?  What is it up to?  My professional and personal experience has not filled me with confidence regarding institutions.  The thing that has kept me going has been the presence of good, honest and courageous people on the ground.  Many honest and courageous people give up.  On occasions, I almost give up and I am privileged in the sense of being paid to speak.  If my personal and professional experience, and I have had the privilege of being in different professions, has not filled me with confidence, then one has to ask serious questions about what is going on with the practices, policies and procedures in place in the HSE, the banks and all the other institutions that psychologically choke a person rather than let them come forward.<br\/><br\/>We think of Vicky Phelan.  I use her name most reluctantly and only to bring up the confidential agreement she courageously refused to sign.  If we are to show leadership as a Government, where does it start?  Surely it should start with the stopping of confidential agreements relating to matters such as that, which can only stop learning and reinforce a very bad system.  Only because Vicky Phelan had the courage to come forward and say &quot;No&quot; did we learn about that matter.  That is repeated everywhere.  If we consider Sergeant McCabe, luckily he found his phone.  Otherwise, that man was in serious trouble, despite all the things we might say retrospectively.<br\/><br\/>We can repeat that over and over.  My experience on the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of university education was shocking.  There were whistleblowers from the University of Limerick and whistleblowers in relation to the Grace case mentioned by Deputy McGuinness, where it seems, from reading the newspaper, that the whistleblower concerned has had a dreadful time and has ended up in the courts.  I do not know the details.  We certainly did not champion those whistleblowers, notwithstanding the wonderful legislation.  We have the dream and the reality.  What is happening here?  We need to show leadership.  Do we remember the Nyberg report on banking, which referenced the herd mentality, the consensus approach and the value put on loyalty as opposed to courage, honesty and integrity?<\/p> <p>When are we going to reward those values to back up the legislation?  That is what we need to do here; otherwise, we are just playing games as usual.  I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides.  He has come forward in a very straight way, working with us in a collaborative manner.  I welcome that.<\/p> <p> On the outstanding recommendations from the committee, I note the Minister proposes to look at them at committee level, in particular the issue of retrospection.  Is there some way we can deal with people who have existing disclosures in a manner that meets the spirit of the new legislation, regardless of whether they come under it?  There is also the issue of legal advice and extra advice.  Money is given to Transparency International Ireland.  What analysis has been done in regard to how effective that is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600063#RRR00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645039920,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Everybody welcomes this protected disclosures legislation.  Everybody recognises the necessity for it.  There have been discussions in regard to some of the recommendations that might not be covered in it, but in fairness to the Minister he has stated he is open to a conversation around that and to taking on board some amendments.  That is necessary.  A significant number of Deputies have spoken specifically about protected disclosures that are already in play and the need for an element of retrospection.  That goes without saying.<\/p>  <p>  As has been stated, in an ideal society we would not necessarily require this legislation, but this is far from an ideal society.  We have a long history of State agencies and non-State agencies protecting themselves and literally closing the doors.  It has been very difficult to get to the bottom of cases where serious harm and wrong have been done.  We have had a real slowness of putting up hands and admitting to mistakes and in regard to fixing those mistakes.<\/p>  <p>  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, members heard from representatives of the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, about the necessity for a greater level of regulation with regard to the Irish Aviation Authority to protect not only pilots, but the flying public.  The IALPA representatives stated that this is required in primary legislation because what they want and need within the airline industry in this State is a just culture, which is the idea and what we want to see eventually within our agencies, including the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that we accept that an awful lot of mistakes are not necessarily made on the basis of wrongdoing.  Some are and they need to be dealt with, including by way of criminal sanction, but in many cases they are not.  We need a system where people who have seen wrongdoing or mistakes feel free to come forward and those mistakes can be addressed, protocols fixed and the system rectified.  If it is the case that some of them are happening continually, it might be an issue of under-resourcing and that needs to be dealt with.  We need to make sure that we, at least, have that just culture, that ability for communication and that everything is above board.  As I said, we do not have a great history in this State in regard to this issue.  A significant number of people are engaged in particular disputes with agencies, arms of the State and with Government from the point of view of seeking answers in regard to their questions and, beyond that, in regard to a mechanism that will provide them with accountability, answers and long-term solutions.  <\/p>  <p>  Like many other speakers, in particular from County Louth, I have spoken previously about the need for a public inquiry in regard to the tragedy and the 23 lives lost in Dealgan House at the beginning of the pandemic.  The Taoiseach has stated he does not believe commissions of inquiry are necessarily the correct mechanism, that they can be costly and that they will not get to where they need to get on time or provide satisfaction to all.  If that is the case, the Taoiseach will have to come up with a solution.  That is the responsibility of Government.  It is the case that people will always look for public inquiries where the State has failed within its own wherewithal to deal with miscarriages of justice and cases of abuse.  We are still dealing with the Women of Honour situation, where women bravely came forward.  They are not particularly happy with the mechanism the State has employed in regard to dealing with their issue.  Other Deputies have spoken about the Maurice McCabe and CervicalCheck cases.  We need to get to a better place in regard to all of that. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome some of what has been said by the Minister in regard to the conversations we have had previously, whether on SIPO or the freedom of information system.  He also spoke about the idea of open government.  We need to take this opportunity to ensure we have strong whistleblower legislation that covers every angle possible.  We all want the same end result, that is, to catch wrongdoing, fraud and mistakes and to have in place an open system that protects people so that they can come forward with information.  We would like it if we could create a culture whereby they would not necessarily need these safety mechanisms but that culture does not exist at this point in time.  Until we get to that point, we need to do this.  There is an onus on the Minister and the Government to deliver and to identify where the weaknesses are.  A significant amount of work has been done in this area by my colleagues, Deputies Buckley and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  We need to deliver a system that will work for all of the people out there.  People want to see justice, accountability and transparency.  More important, they want a system that works for everybody and the freedom that will allow people to come forward so that we can identify problems and address them as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600065#TTT00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1645039920,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The Deputy has two minutes remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600065#TTT00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1645039920,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I am happy to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600065#TTT00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1645039920,"counter":420,"content":"<p>This is one of the rare times I will not be asking the Deputy to stop speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600065#TTT00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1645039920,"counter":421,"content":"<p>There is an element of shock.  I am not used to this.<\/p>  <p>  In fairness, I am being straight with the Minister, as I am occasionally, in the sense that he has been somewhat forward-thinking around this particular issue and the idea of openness and transparency.  It is a matter of ensuring that we follow through on the actions because the current system is not good enough.  We have already heard many testimonies in that regard.  We have heard Deputies speak about a number of the whistleblowers and the damage that has been done to their lives because these protections were not in place for them.  We need to ensure we put those protections in place.  As I said, there is, I believe, an element of weakness in not dealing with retrospection.  There is a requirement to deal with that as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600065#TTT00600","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645039920,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Tackling the Cost of Living - Institutional Investors in the Residential Property Market: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1645040520,"counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600066#UUU00150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645040520,"counter":424,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Pearse Doherty on Tuesday, 15 February 2022:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645040520,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:<\/p><p>- (Minister for Finance)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1645040520,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the motion concerning tackling the cost of living.
