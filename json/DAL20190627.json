It has been a pleasure to work with him in a very constructive way since I took up this position.  I wish him the very best in the European Parliament.  I have no doubt he will make a significant contribution there also.<\/p>  <p>  Regional development remains a key priority for me and my Department.  We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and my Department and its agencies have been working hard towards that goal.  Significant progress has been made.  For example, 58% of all IDA Ireland client-supported employment is now situated outside Dublin.  This figure represents the highest level of regional employment in the history of the agency.  Last year, IDA Ireland secured 113 regional investments.  This strong level of performance in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland is being maintained.  Last week, I announced IDA Ireland's mid-year results for 2019, which included 13,500 new jobs approved across the country, representing an increase of 19% on the equivalent period last year.  Indications are that further strong employment and investment growth will be achieved over the latter half of the year, which will lead to more economic opportunities across regional Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As I previously made clear, the availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment.  Not only does such a supply of properties help the agency to secure high-quality jobs, it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.  For that reason, it remains an important means by which IDA Ireland can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland owns 29 properties across Ireland.  Of these, 14 are occupied by agency clients, with the remainder available for prospective or existing investors.  It is important that IDA Ireland has such a supply of properties in order that it can better compete with other jurisdictions for job-rich investment and secure new projects for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700003#A00800","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1561627800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I accept that it is very difficult for a Minister to instruct industry or commerce to locate in a certain area.

The vast majority of IDA Ireland sites that are lying idle are located in the places that most need job creation and investment and which are very much struggling to attract multinational foreign direct investment, such as the Border region, the midlands and parts of the south east.  It is evident that this is having a direct impact on the commercial life of towns across the country.  In some towns, there are more shops boarded up than there are operating commercially.  There needs to be a refocusing and re-energising of investment in the regions and IDA Ireland plays a key role in that regard.  We must consistently advocate for the regions.

I thank Deputy Quinlivan for raising this issue.<\/p><p>Global competition for foreign direct investment, FDI, is as intense as ever.  We compete against many other countries and big cities from all over the world when it comes to securing new job-rich FDI from overseas.  That is why the IDA&rsquo;s main priority in its efforts is first of all win the projects, and to ensure that Ireland is selected by the firm in question.<\/p><p>Once that is achieved, which is a big achievement, the agency does everything it can to encourage companies to locate or expand into regional locations.  This is consistent with both the IDA&rsquo;s current policy, which has targeted an ambitious increase in regional investment by the end of 2019, and the Government&rsquo;s wider approach of strengthening enterprise all over Ireland.  This joint focus on the regions is yielding significant results, as was evident again from the IDA&rsquo;s mid-year jobs and investment figures for 2019, with 50% of jobs now located outside of Dublin.<\/p><p>The Government also wants our principal cities to remain highly attractive to multinational firms.  Dublin, in particular, with its international profile and track record as a home to many successful overseas companies, will continue to be a favoured destination for many investors, as evidenced again by recent job announcements.  That is very much a positive that we have a strong capital city to generate investment in the country as a whole.  It is also the case that our cities and regions are competing against the rest of the world, rather than against one another, for investment projects.<\/p><p>As regards the housing market, and in particular in increasing supply, that is well documented.  It is important to make clear that these difficulties are not attributable to multinational firms and the jobs they have created, whether in Dublin or elsewhere.  The root causes of our housing market difficulties are much more complicated than that, as the Deputy is aware.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s focus has been on addressing those housing problems and delivering fair and sustainable solutions over the short, medium and long term.  That is why we are implementing the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which includes financing measures, new construction and rental sector improvements.  As of the first quarter of 2019, there have been almost 19,000 new houses completed, an increase of 25% compared to the same time last year.  Dwellings in the Dublin and mid-east region account for over 60% of these completed properties.

But they understand too how much of a priority this is for Government and what has been done to increase supply.

That does not diminish our own housing challenges, which we remain determined to address, but it does serve as a reminder that these are problems that many others are also wrestling with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700004#B00600","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561628400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am not suggesting for a minute to the Minister of State that the IDA is causing or contributing to the housing crisis but there is a problem around housing.

That is the problem I am raising.  It is a sad state of affairs that due to the shambolic housing policy of the Government we have to be concerned about not having enough dwellings to house new workers and their families for the jobs that are being created here.  I understand that we are competing with the rest of the world for jobs and as I stated in my initial contribution I welcome every single job that is approved, whether that is for Dublin or for the regions.

I also met the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment during the development of the plan, under which the enterprise sector is being tasked with reducing greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions by between 10% and 15% by 2030.  Enterprises will also contribute to the more ambitious targets for buildings by reducing their emissions by 20% to 25% by 2030 and transport which will be reduced by 45% to 50% by 2030 through actions to improve their building energy performance and replace their fleets with electric vehicles over time.<\/p><p>My Department and its agencies are fully committed to the implementation of the actions identified in the plan.

Deputy Kelleher previously served in my office as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce and trade, where I know he was very popular with all of the staff.  I understand some of my staff worked with him during his tenure as Minister of State.  I wish the Deputy Kelleher well in his new role.  It is an important role.  Our future emanates from Europe and our MEPs have a lot of important work to do over the next five years.  The Deputy's experience in this House will stand to him as he takes on his new role in the European Parliament.  I wish him well.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to Deputy Browne's question, enterprise development and sustainable job creation in the regions is a key priority of the Government.  A total of 18,300 more people in the south east are in employment in quarter 1 2019 than there were in quarter 1 2015 when the regional action plan for jobs initiative was launched.  Unemployment has reduced from 11.7% to 6.7% in the same period.  The State average figure at quarter 1 2019 is 4.8%.<\/p>  <p>  While we have had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment,\u00a0in the context of Brexit and other global challenges, it is important that we move our focus to the creation of quality and sustainable jobs.  In this context, the Deputy has raised an important question.  Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet these challenges.  Launched last March, it includes ambitious targets and actions to drive the transformation of our economy. <\/p>  <p>  In the south east, there were 15,580 people employed across 76 IDA Ireland client companies in 2018, an increase of almost 7% on 2017.  The IDA will continue to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in the south east, promoting the region's strengths, including its ports and existing concentrations of financial services, IT and high-value manufacturing activities. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, there were 25,214 people employed in Enterprise Ireland, EI, supported companies in the south east, an increase of 5% over 2017.  Earlier this week, the Minister launched Enterprise Ireland's\u00a0new regional plan, Powering the Regions, which\u00a0sets out the focus of its activities in each region, including the south east.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10% and 15% in each region by the end 2020, from\u00a0quarter 1 2015, and to bring and-or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.  To this end, we recently launched nine new regional enterprise plans to 2020, which build on the  strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017.  Last March, we launched the south east plan, which covers counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford in Waterford, with strategic objectives focused on building enterprise resilience, marketing the region, a regional engagement strategy on key infrastructure priorities, ensuring the south east is a learning region, and tourism growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700007#E01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561630200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I do not get the sense that the Minister, the Minister of State, or the Government understand the position in the south east.

Numerous towns in the south east are consistently ranked among the lowest in terms of average incomes.  Wexford, in particular, is on the doorstep of Dublin.  It is linked by motorways, it has a significant population but it is not being serviced.  The south east also has one of the lowest numbers of IDA jobs.  There is no focus on address of the situation in the south east.

Future Jobs Ireland is a new medium-term economic framework aimed at ensuring our economy is resilient enough to withstand shocks in the future and agile enough to take advantage of opportunities when they arise.

Innovation drives productivity - as we all know - through new, higher value-added products and services and more efficient business processes.  Ireland continues to perform strongly in terms of innovation.

My Department and its agencies have consistently advised businesses that it is crucial they check their supply chains for vulnerabilities to Brexit impacts.

The LEOs are the first stop shop for advice on starting and growing a business locally.  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies to prepare for Brexit, including the Brexit scorecard, the Be Prepared grant, advisory clinics, the agile innovation fund, the operational excellence offer, the market discovery fund, online customs training and the Act On Initiative consultancy.

These nine new plans take into account new and emerging opportunities and challenges including Brexit.  I am pleased to say that implementation has commenced in all nine regions.  Shaped from the bottom up by regional stakeholders, which is important to point out, and overseen by my Department, the new plans complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the top down and there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and with the Government's Project Ireland 2040 and the Future Jobs Ireland initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  We launched the regional enterprise plan for the mid-west region, which covers Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, on 20 February at the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation site at Lisheen, County Tipperary.  The plan for the mid-west is focused on achieving impacts across five strategic objectives including developing the digital and innovation economy, progressing towards a low carbon economy, developing workforce skills, developing the capacity for economic growth and building a co-ordinated regional brand.  Each of the five objectives involves a focus on County Limerick as part of the mid-west region.  Initiatives to be pursued under the plan of significance for Limerick city and county include the development of an autonomous mobility testbed, the positioning of Limerick and the mid-west as a national centre for advanced manufacturing and the development of a sports technology cluster, building on the initial study by Limerick City and County Council.<\/p>  <p>  The strategic objectives and actions in the mid-west plan are set out alongside, and add value to, the enterprise agencies&rsquo; activities, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, and the LEOs' core activities in County Limerick and the wider mid-west region, including the recently launched Enterprise Ireland regional strategy, Powering the Regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700011#J01200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561632600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is prudent and innovative to move into those different clusters and not have a region be seen for just one specific cluster.

I have a written reply that will go on the record of the House and that will be available to the Deputy.  He is right that companies need to look at where they source their goods.  I recently met a company that imports oranges for jam-making.  It always imported the oranges from the UK.  With the support of Enterprise Ireland, it decided to look at new sources.  It now sources its oranges from Spain.  They are cheaper, better quality and make better jam.  Companies should look at their supply chain, where they can source different products and look to Europe where companies are guaranteed there will be no tariffs or disruption when importing from across the EU.  I thank Deputy Durkan for raising the issue.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In my role as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation I have met with many businesses throughout the country, in all regions, and across a variety of sectors.  I have been impressed with the levels of ambition, talent and creativity that I have seen in our companies.  I am committed, through my Department and my work with ministerial colleagues across Government, to helping these businesses to maximise their opportunities, to succeed in both domestic and international markets and fulfil their potential.<\/p><p>While we had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment from 16% to 4.4% today, we recognise the need to move our focus beyond numbers of jobs created to quality sustainable jobs and to building resilience in the enterprise base.<\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet all these challenges.  It includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy and it was developed based on extensive consultation with the business sector and other stakeholders.  In the context of Brexit preparedness, I also continue to chair a number of stakeholder grouping, including the Retail Consultation Forum, which has had a specific focus on Brexit over the last year and my Department's Trade and Investment Stakeholder Group, which meets roughly every six weeks.<\/p><p>Regarding import substitution, I have been consistently urging businesses of all sizes to put their supply chains under the microscope to check for risks and vulnerabilities to the UK.  Businesses could very well be exposed through their supply chain upstream, such as those who import ingredients, materials or components from the UK.  They may be impacted with tariffs or delays at the port, which could impact on cashflow and that is why we have put in place the Brexit Loan Scheme to help businesses to prepare.  Once businesses have assessed their supply chain&rsquo;s exposure there are a range of supports on offer from Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and the 31 local enterprise offices and information on what actions to take.<\/p><p>An important element of this commitment is my Department&rsquo;s annual Global Sourcing Initiative, helping EI clients to develop relationships with Irish based multinationals, through sales, partnership, R&amp;amp;D collaboration and innovation.  This year there were more than 400 meetings with 96 Ireland-based multinational companies and 188 Irish suppliers.<\/p><p>Another key priority for businesses looking to succeed is to focus on diversification.  Diversification is not just about markets, it also about diversifying into new products, new sectors and new methods of working.  It is, therefore, vital that Irish companies increase their levels of investment in innovation and R&amp;amp;D.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700011#J01900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561632600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1561633200,"counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700012#K00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1561633200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>As we gather in the Chamber our thoughts are very much in St. Columba's Church in Glenswilly as the funeral mass gets under way for the late Councillor Manus Kelly.

I want him to give a commitment to the House that the plan will be published before 11 July when the House goes into recess for the summer.  The letter in the article this morning outlined a number of concerns of HSE management and the officials in charge of implementing the plan.  There is one line in it that sums everything up, which is &quot;The additional impact now of the national children's hospital overrun over the years 2020\/2021\/2022 has made what was a very difficult situation almost impossible.&quot;  This is from the horse's mouth.  This is from the people in charge of the programme whose job it is to implement it.  However, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, continue to act as if there is no problem and continue to state there is nothing to see here and that they will manage the cost overruns and spread them out.  The Government published a list of projects that would be re-profiled.<\/p><p>The people on the ground and in charge of implementing this project have sent up a flag this morning.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's reaction to this?  The only political oversight of the national children's hospital during its inception related to the PR opportunities involved, and the photographs would happen at the right time.  There was oversight of yellow jackets, hard hats and cameras.  Meanwhile, the overspend continued to mount and now it will hit communities throughout the country.  This has been proven by the letter this morning.<\/p><p>The capital plan means new buildings, new facilities and new ambulances.  It is the essence of what is important in redesigning our health programme in line with the aspirations of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The then acting director general called it out for what it is.  As we speak, the director general and the Secretary General of the Department of Health are before the Committee of Public Accounts outlining the ongoing charges to the health budget.  This overspend has happened on the Government's watch.  Will he comment on the letter and commit to the publication of the HSE's capital plan for 2019?

Based on the outcome of the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process in December 2018, an additional &euro;100 million was required to fund the project this year.  The Government decided that &euro;24 million of this additional requirement would be provided from the health capital allocation.  The balance for 2019 of &euro;75 million will be met by rescheduling capital allocations in other Departments, which has been the subject of discussion in the Chamber many times.  This is out of a total proposed capital allocation in the State of &euro;7.33 billion in 2019.  It is important to note that this is an increase of &euro;1.33 billion, or 22%, on the 2018 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  The new children's hospital is a vital and much needed project and the Government has examined the funding pressures associated with delivering this important project.

I again ask the T&aacute;naiste to commit to publishing that plan before we go into recess in order that we can have a debate on it.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's comment on the fact that the then acting director general of the HSE stated the additional impact of the national children's hospital has made a very difficult situation almost impossible?  How does he respond to this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700012#K00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1561633200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Allocating capital resources in healthcare is always challenging.

In January, the Taoiseach stated no capital project would be delayed or cut as a result of the cost overrun in the children's hospital.  Only last Thursday, in the very seat in which the T&aacute;naiste is sitting, the Minister for Finance reiterated this position during Question Time.  He stated no project would be cut or delayed as a result of the cost overruns in the children's hospital.  In February, a draft capital plan by the HSE was discussed and it was almost ready to be signed off.<\/p><p>However, as a result of the information then given to the HSE on the cost overruns on the national children's hospital project, the capital plan had to be revisited.  We are coming up to 1 July and the plan has still not been published.  It is not possible for the Government to have it both ways.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance cannot state there is no impact on the capital projects which have been announced as a result of the cost overruns.  That is because this morning at the Committee of Public Accounts, leaving aside what the interim director general of the HSE, Ms O'Connor, said, the director general who is in the job some six weeks stated the very reason we did not have a capital plan published by the HSE was the direct result and consequences of the cost overruns on the national children's hospital project.  The HSE is still in negotiations with the Department of Health to see what impact the overruns will have on capital projects in 2020, 2021 and 2022. We have been trying to get the capital plan published for six months.  We are being told that there is no issue when it comes to capital projects and that there are no cuts or delays for budgetary reasons.  If that is the case, what has the HSE and the Department of Health been discussing for the past five to six months regarding the capital plan?  Why has it not been published?  It does not add up.  What the T&aacute;naiste is stating is not credible.  The overruns either have an impact and we are still trying to figure what it will be, which is why the plan has not been published, or there is politics going on and an attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes.  The overruns will either have an impact or they will not.

There were two parts to the project when it was first put before the members of Kerry County Council.  The first part runs from Lissivigeen to beyond Farranfore on the N22.  It is to run from Lissivigeen to Castlelough on the Muckross road on the N70.  It is a vital project which will reduce pressure and the number of accidents from Lissivigeen to beyond Farranfore.  There have been many fatalities at Coolcaslagh, Ballycasheen, the top of Lewis road, Madam's Hill and the Four Roads junction in Farranfore village.  At the last count, on the current bypass which is not sufficient, an estimated 18,600 vehicles passed by daily.  It is probably higher now.  The road links the Ring of Kerry, the Killorglin road and the Cork to Tralee road.<\/p>  <p>  The other leg will run from Lissivigeen to Castlelough to avoid the need for traffic from Kenmare and the Ring of Kerry to pass through the heart of Killarney town.  All of the traffic heading to other parts of the country would not have to use the Muckross road.  It would also mean that all of the traffic, the thousands of cars heading to Muckross House and Gardens and the national park would not have to pass through Killarney town and clog it up.  The Muckross road, the town, Mission road and Dr. Hans Liebherr Road become parking lots at certain times of the day because traffic cannot move.  On the one hand, it is good that we have this traffic into Killarney town which is the tourist capital of Ireland and where the tourism operators are second to none.  However, they need assistance at this stage to ensure their product will not be diminished by visitors complaining about being held up in traffic.<\/p><p>This project was first put in front of us in 2004.

The scheme provides for a bypass of Farranfore village, a new realigned N22, including a link into Killarney town, and an outer bypass of Killarney town.

Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, approval has now been issued to Kerry County Council to commence the procurement of technical advisers.  A defined route corridor already has been selected.  The project was suspended in 2010 or 2011 when there was no money.  The project appraisal plan was prepared in 2018 and it is now moving forward.

Coming from a working-class Protestant tradition, he ended up managing a shirt factory.  Championing the cause of the Catholic workers in his factory, he led the parades in 1968 and the famous Bloody Sunday parade in 1972, the source of so much of our Troubles.  We are in trouble again.<\/p>  <p>  After the murder of Lyra McKee almost two and a half months ago, Fr. Martin McGill asked why it had taken the death of a 29 year old woman for the parties of the North to come together again and commit to doing what they could to see a restoration of the Executive and the assembly in the North.  It was hoped that this would be concluded by the end of June.  I cannot see any sign of that eventuality whatsoever.  I presume that such hopes will be put aside with the marching season.  The difficulty is that when we return in September, we are likely to be in a most complex and fraught negotiating position with the UK Government over what is happening with Brexit.  It is highly unlikely that restoration could be carried out in such circumstances.  Then we will hit October.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday in the national economic dialogue, a no-deal Brexit is now highly likely.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the first deadline in March, Mr. David Penman, the general secretary of the trade union representing public servants in the North, said that civil servants could not take the kind of decisions that would need to be taken in such a scenario.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, said in the House of Commons that some direct application of powers would have to be put in place in those circumstances.  We would be back to direct rule.  The Good Friday Agreement would be in tatters and the environment which created the conditions for it would be gone.  We would face a no-deal scenario with many differences between the jurisdictions in the North and South.  We would have to manage that directly with Westminster Ministers with whom we would probably be in a very uncomfortable relationship.  We have a big problem with the Brexit issue but we have an even bigger problem with our immediate relations in the North.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, this is the T&aacute;naiste's responsibility.  What in the scenario I have just set out is likely to change?  How can we avoid ending up with direct rule in three or four months?  What can we do about it?  Will we slowly sleepwalk into an incredible political crisis on this island, as well as between this island and the neighbouring one?

With the support of all parties in the Oireachtas, we introduced the most extensive ever animal welfare legislation.  We agreed to review in detail the greyhound industry and how it was run.  To that end, an Indecon report was commissioned and its recommendations were acted on.  New legislation is in place on the back of it to change structures within the industry to ensure traceability can be delivered with no excuses.  I promise the House, having spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine this morning, that the illegality evident in last night's report will be followed up and that we will look to secure prosecutions where we can.  Just under 80 prosecutions have followed the introduction of the new animal welfare legislation, but there are other things on which we need to follow up, too.  If Irish greyhounds are being sent to the United Kingdom to be exported to parts of the world where we cannot guarantee their welfare, we will speak to the United Kingdom about it to try to shut it off.

He was Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for five years.  We are a nation of animal lovers.  Most people throughout the country were disgusted by what they saw on the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night which seemed to indicate a major wanton slaughter of greyhounds, numbering up to 6,000, year in year out, simply because they were not fast enough.  Also, there is the issue of the licensing of knackeries as the conditions in them seem appalling.  What actions will the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister responsible take in response to the reporting of these matters?  Many people throughout the country are outraged and want urgent action taken.  We have the new Act and I have the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill on the cl&aacute;r, which deals with the export of greyhounds.  We seem to have been told a pack of lies about such exports.  Greyhounds are being exported to countries with deplorable animal welfare conditions and nothing is being done about it.

We spoke about this issue this morning before Leaders' Questions.

It is not acceptable that greyhounds that are to be put down because of injury or whatever other reason are not put down in an appropriate manner with the supervision of a vet.  The days of sending a dog to the knackery or to the abattoir are long since over or they should be.  Illegal activity will be pursued.  We have the animal welfare legislation in place and new legislation for the greyhound industry to be able to ensure we have a proper transparent system that tracks where dogs are, who owns them, where they travel to, to whom they are sold and so on.  If there is over-breeding within this sector, which I suspect perhaps there is, that is also something the Government needs to look at from a policy perspective.  This is a sector the State significantly supports financially.  It is an important one.  It needs to be supported but it also needs to stamp illegal activity or animal welfare concerns, which were outlined last night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700017#P00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1561636200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I also wish Deputies Clare Daly, Wallace, Fitzgerald and Kelleher the very best.

The purpose of the legislation is to amend section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, which deals with the crime of possession of knives.  The Acting Chairman will be aware that there have recently been a number of significant criminal events involving the use of knives.  Last month a young man was killed with a knife in Dundrum.  Earlier this month a man was killed with a knife on O'Connell Street.  Two days ago, a woman was killed with a knife in the region of the Liberties in Dublin.  Unfortunately the crime statistics that are compiled do not give us specific detail on the number of homicides or assaults committed with a knife, but we do have some statistics that indicate that the use and carrying of knives is increasing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been able to provide information to the Minister, which he shared with me in the answer to a parliamentary question.  The number of knives seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately 66% since 2016.  In 2017, 1,600 knives were seized.  In 2018, 2,000 were seized.  From the recent terrible events and the statistics with which we have been provided, it seems that knives are being carried more frequently.  Unfortunately, it also appears to be the case that people are using knives, sometimes with fatal and tragic consequences.<\/p><p>As I have said, the purpose of this legislation is to amend section 9 of the 1990 Act.  This section deals with the possession of knives.  Section 9(7) deals with the penalties that can be imposed by a court on somebody who is convicted of possession of a knife.  The simple purpose of this legislation is to increase the maximum penal sentence that can be imposed upon a person who is found guilty on indictment of possession of a knife from five years to ten years.  At present the maximum penalty is five years.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes this should be increased to ten years.  <\/p><p>We are also fully aware that legislation cannot be the only response to this issue.  The legislation will seek to provide a greater deterrent to those who are contemplating carrying a knife but we need a much broader response, based in society, to the issue.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that many young men think it is appropriate, acceptable and, sometimes, necessary to carry a knife when going out.  The message needs to get across that this is not correct.  It is dangerous for them and for others and it can destroy lives, whether the life of a person stabbed with a knife or the life of a person who perpetrates such an act.  Many perpetrators do not go out with a knife on the day of the offence with the intention of causing harm.  They do so because they unwisely believe that it is necessary for their own defence.<\/p><p>In the neighbouring jurisdiction, and in London in particular, there is a chronic problem with the use of knives and the damage such use causes to younger people in particular.

The motion before the House is to approve the memorandum of understanding, MOU, agreed among the battle group participants arising from that decision.<\/p><p>The MOU relates solely to the administrative and technical arrangements for the operation of the battle group.  Any decision on a deployment of the proposed Defence Forces contingent on a battle group operation will require a further decision of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts.<\/p><p>Based on advice from the Office of the Attorney General, this MOU is not subject to approval by the D&aacute;il.  However, I previously gave a commitment, which I stand by, to bring the memorandum before the D&aacute;il, with due respect for transparency and the role of the House.<\/p><p>In commending the motion, I would like to outline the background to Ireland's participation in this EU battle group which will be led by Germany.  The EU aims to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises as and when they occur.  The purpose of the EU battle groups is to meet this objective and undertake operations as outlined in the Treaty on the European Union.  These operations, known as the Petersberg Tasks, which were further expanded in the Lisbon treaty, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking and peacebuilding, joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.<\/p><p>Ireland has worked to uphold the primacy of the role of the United Nations Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping, peace enforcement and crisis management operations, and our efforts at EU level to enhance EU-UN co-operation.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express its commitment to the UN and its principles.  In this regard, Members will recall that successive Secretaries General of the UN have endorsed the EU battle group concept and have encouraged and advocated for Ireland's participation in battle groups that could act in support of UN operations.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces contribution to this battle group will involve a special operations task group comprising a special operations forces platoon, engineer special search capability, explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, capability and a security platoon together with staff posts at force headquarters.  The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this battle group will be approximately 150.  This level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  The Defence Forces commitment leading up to and during the standby period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation will amount to ten personnel deployed to the battle group force headquarters in Germany.<\/p><p>The German battle group MOU is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely Germany, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Latvia and the Netherlands.  This agreement sets out principles on the operation, deployment and management of the German battle group.  The text of this agreement was laid in the Oireachtas Library in advance of our debate today.  Its terms are similar to those that Ireland has previously acceded to for the 2016 German battle group.<\/p><p>Each individual battle group participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  In Ireland's case, the triple lock requirement for the deployment of the Defence Forces contingent will remain unaffected by its accession to this memorandum of understanding.<\/p><p>Ireland's participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces.  It enhances Ireland&rsquo;s credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  It reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security and the UN.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700020#S00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1561638000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>My party is committed to, and embraces fully, the important role our Defence Forces play in peacekeeping operations.

We do not want all of this.  Leave it to others, if they want to become part and parcel of battle groups.  Battle groups are not peacekeepers.

For anyone with a tradition rooted in neutrality and peacekeeping, the instinct is to baulk at the idea of supporting such a thing.  EU battle groups exist in a state of preparedness to deploy within five to ten days of a Council decision to a range of possible missions, including crisis management and humanitarian assistance missions.  As is referenced in documents supplied by the Minister, the term \"battle group\" is unfortunate, as it is a standard, technical military term referring to a battalion-sized force with support elements, including logistics and transport.  This has been the Irish experience in battle groups since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that Ireland's participation in a battle group operation would be subject to the usual triple lock requirements of a UN mandate, Government approval and D&aacute;il approval, in accordance with the Defence Acts.  We in the Labour Party support Ireland's right to determine for itself on a case-by-case basis whether it will participate in any battle group operation.  As ever, the Labour Party is committed to protecting Ireland from involvement in any wars or battles of aggression.  We have a proud tradition as a neutral arbiter in world conflicts and are synonymous with peacekeeping and peacemaking.  Last week, we objected to the motion on sending troops to Mali, as we felt that it breached our standards of what kind of operations we should and should not be involved in.  This motion on EU battle groups does not breach that threshold.<\/p>  <p>  We need to have honest debates in this Chamber about our Defence Forces.  It is easy to vote against this on the basis of the name including the word \"battle\".  It is also easy to raise alarm bells about super armies and rampant militarisation, but we should vote on the detail of the motion and how it would play out practically in the real world.  Involvement in these battle groups provides the members of our Defence Forces with modern training and interesting exercises, and builds up positive relationships with our European partner states.  Some in this House might be happy to see our Defence Forces wallowing in domestic barracks with very little to do.  However, I have met members of our Defence Forces and know that they want to be active, to travel and to learn.  I want that for them as well.  They want to mix with other forces and exchange expertise and experiences.  Ultimately, our members can learn from these experiences and that assists in the practical application of peacekeeping, which is where Ireland's Defence Forces are in active operation.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to be honest and true to Defence Forces personnel and to our principles as a neutral state.  We have been in battle groups previously.  In 2008, 2011 and 2015, we were members of Nordic-led battle groups, and in 2016, a member of an EU battle group.  We have not compromised our values, nor have we supported sending our troops into any battle of aggression.  That will not change.  Arguments about European super armies are a red herring when it comes to battle groups.  There is no appetite in the Labour Party, this House or the country for us to be in any sort of super army.  The triple lock will remain in place and we are satisfied with those safeguards.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth acknowledging that the Minister did not have to bring the motion to the House for agreement.  He has done so to keep the House up to date and included in the plans and operations for our Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  If the House has not gathered it already, Labour will be support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700021#T00500","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1561638600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>There are times when debate in this House is surreal, and this is one of them.

Wars are always fought on the basis of false premises.  Humanitarian reasons have, since the beginning of conflict, been a tried and trusted reason that various imperialist powers have reached for.  A justification for First World War was the protection of Belgian refugees.  The 19th century French intervention in Syria was justified as being for humanitarian reasons.  The US invasion of Haiti in 1915 was for humanitarian reasons.  It stretches to the present day, through the first Gulf War in the 1990s and the later Gulf War based on the dodgy dossiers.  There were also the NATO interventions in Yugoslavia and Kosovo and, in 2011, the NATO-led attacks in Libya.  Imperialist interventions are often justified as being on the basis of humanitarian need so this is no exception.<\/p><p>Is it true, as Deputy Wallace has said in the past, that Ireland's participation in battle groups has resulted in our troops being trained in the use of armoured personnel carriers armed with 30 mm cannons, grenade launchers and other such advanced weaponry?

As Deputy Boyd Barrett did, I will quote the words of Angela Merkel.  Not only did she come out openly in favour of a European army, she also said that, in the long run, Europe must become more capable to act:<\/p><blockquote>We have to reconsider our ways of deciding and to renounce the principle of unanimity where the European treaties allow and wherever this is necessary.

It is all about financial gain for the French.  The Americans and others are there as well, as are the Chinese and Russians.

I strongly disagree with the fact that Shannon is being used by the US military to cause terrible destruction worldwide.  <\/p>  <p>  More than 60 million people are now displaced because of war.  The militarisation of the planet has gone off the Richter scale and we are now looking at a gradual militarisation of Europe.  It is very dangerous.  Money is now being taken from environmental projects in Europe to go towards military subsidy.  That is only subsidising the arms industry.  The lobbyists from that industry are wearing out the carpets in Europe to get what they want.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers named a number of so-called neutral countries that have also signed up to these battle groups.  Unfortunately, the number of countries in Europe that are prepared to stand up to the might of the military complex is zero.  We will take no credit from being in the same boat as them.<\/p>  <p>  This is the wrong path and that is an enormous problem.<\/p><p>Everybody seems to be interested in the environment all of a sudden, but there is no entity on the planet causing more problems for the environment than the United States military and its 4,800 bases worldwide.  There is no logic to us having anything to do with military expansion in Europe.  It is a huge mistake and not what the people want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700022#U00600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I wish Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly and the others elected to the European Parliament the very best.  I was present for Deputy Wallace's maiden speech and also present to listen to his leaving speech.  I hope they will not be gone for too long, but I wish them well and know that they will be good representatives in the European Parliament.  We will miss Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly from the Independent benches.<\/p>  <p>  I too have major concerns about the ongoing situation with the Army.  We know that the Defence Forces are being mistreated because the report of the Low Pay Commission has not been published.  We meet members of the Defence Forces every week in our clinics and although they cannot go on strike, they are being treated appallingly.  I am worried as week after week we are becoming involved in different issues across Europe and with the United Nations.  I am proud of our record in United Nations missions in conflicts around the world through the decades.  There are many people from Clonmel in the different representative organisations who have been to the Congo and elsewhere where it was very dangerous.<\/p>  <p>  The wording of the motion is blatant and there is reference to a \"battlegroup\".  Surely they could have called it some other kind of humanitarian mission and found a better name for it.  We have heard what Mrs. Merkel has said and should not sign up.  The Minister of State has listed the countries which are joining and implied that we should follow suit.  We have been punished enough for being the good boy in Europe and cheerleading.  The members of the battle group are Germany, Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Latvia and the Netherlands.  We do not have to be the best boy in the class in Europe as we were the best boy when money was shovelled in here to completely mess up the economy before we were fleeced in the so-called bailout, against which I voted and bitterly opposed.  This is a most serious matter.<\/p>  <p>  We must support our troops on UN missions but not in battle groups or similar positions.  We had a debate last week about sending them to Mali and such places which are very dangerous.  That was without having a proper debate or understanding of what went on in these countries.  Many other speakers have said that we do not have personnel to equip Naval Service ships or fly the limited aircraft we have available.  Soldiers are voting with their feet to leave because they are living in poverty.  We want to send them to join what is blatantly called a battle group.  If this is a neutral country, how can we add support to a battle group?  It is what it says on the tin.  It is not a peacekeeping mission.  If it was, why would they call it a battle group?<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what the Minister of State expects us to do.  There is already a coalition on many issues between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government and the Labour Party is also supporting the Government on this one.  I certainly will not be supporting it as I have the greatest of respect for our soldiers and what they have done.  We decided to send the Army Rangers off last week.  The Government should look after them and their families at home.  They should be treated with respect by the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, rather than being placed in more perilous positions.  Sometimes it is done with subterfuge and we do not know where troops are going, but the motion mentions \"battlegroup\".  I will not support the motion and many of my colleagues in the Rural Independents Group will not support it either.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the triple lock, which is meant to be great.  It is meant to be like having braces and a belt or two braces and two belts, but it will depend on the Government of the day and the majority it enjoys.  A Government can push a triple lock mechanism any way it likes and achieve the outcome it desires, but we need to tread cautiously and consider things carefully when we hear the comments we heard from Mrs. Angela Merkel whose country will lead the battle group.  We must make haste slowly and examine things carefully.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace mentioned the expanding use of Shannon Airport, with troops heading to different war zones around the world.  We are in a precarious enough time and should not be putting our soldiers in peril.  It is appalling that in the past 18 months two lots of peacekeepers who were ready to return home were left stranded, high and dry.  There were families waiting for them to attend weddings, First Holy Communion and other events.  They were stranded because of technical issues.  The Government should respect them by keeping them at home where they are safe.  They should go on United Nations missions but not with this kind of battle group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies across the House for their contributions.  Our previous experiences in participating in EU battle groups where countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden have led nations have all been very positive and valuable to members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the Defence Forces.  I again state how important our participation is in developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  This is vital for Ireland when deployed with other countries in peacekeeping operations.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated before, I have concerns about use of the name \"battlegroup\" as it sends the wrong message, but people should look beyond the name to the many positives in Ireland's participation in this mission.  I emphasise that battle groups, in common with all other capabilities under the Common Security and Defence Policy, have been developed to enable the European Union to carry out a range of crisis management tasks as outlined in the Lisbon treaty.  They include humanitarian rescue tasks.  In that context, it is possible that battle group formations could be called on to assist in large-scale complex emergencies where we would want to be useful and effective partners.  I have no doubt that if a humanitarian issue arose, many Deputies who will vote against the motion today would want us to assist.<\/p>  <p>  Participation in the battle group will have no effect on our traditional policy of military neutrality.  A commitment to a battle group does not involve any commitment to common or mutual defence.  Should a battle group be deployed, each battle group participant will retain the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  The deployment of the Defence Forces contingent as part of a battle group in peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations will continue to require an EU mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval, in accordance with the triple lock provisions of the Defence Acts.  This fact remains unaffected by Ireland being a signatory of the memorandum of understanding.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies spoke about an EU army.  The formation of a battle group is not a dry run for a European army as certain Deputies claim each time I bring any motion such as this before the House.  Some Members would love it if members of the Defence Forces rode to barracks in the morning and stayed there all day, except to shovel snow, help when there is flooding or cut trees, etc.  They do not want the Defence Forces to participate in anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00300","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Pay them properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>There is no housing in barracks any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>There are many-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00600","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>They should be paid properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":368,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.

Climate disruption is already having diverse and wide-ranging impacts on Ireland's environment and society, as well as on its economic and natural resources.  The climate action plan sets out an ambitious course in the coming years to address this issue.  The plan which represents an all-of-government approach to the climate challenge consists of 183 actions.  Its focus on renewable energy, for example, includes actions aimed at having 1 million electric vehicles in the State and retrofitting 500,000 homes by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment Deputy Bruton, said when he launched this important document, realising the plan will involve a radical change in the way we do things.  The plan will require considerable investment from public and private sector sources of funding.  According to some estimates, investment of &euro;50 billion or more will be needed.  If we are to meet the plan's objectives, we must harness private capital at home and abroad.  This can be achieved by Ireland which was one of the first countries to recognise the importance of green and sustainable finance.  The private equity funding stream is unavailable in Ireland as a result of the failure to date to pass through both Houses the investment limited partnership legislation which was published recently.  The deployment of capital for the decarbonisation of the economy and our society requires blended finance from Government sources, multilateral banking sources, borrowings and private equity.  When the investment limited partnership legislation is passed, all funding streams will be available in Ireland to make it a global centre of sustainable green finance.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, the Government has been steadily building a cluster of experts in this area.  Several Irish firms are considered to be global leaders in this sector.  There is critical mass of expertise in Dublin and Cork.  Over &euro;30 billion in green and sustainable funds are managed, listed or domiciled from Ireland.  Ten specific green and sustainable finance actions are included in the Ireland for Finance 2025 strategy which was launched by the Department of Finance recently.  This shows that activity is increasing at a fast pace.  The ESB recently issued a &euro;500 million green bond to support its decarbonisation efforts.  At an event jointly co-hosted by the Department of Finance and Sustainable Nation Ireland in May the World Bank issued and listed a &euro;1.5 billion sustainable bond on the Irish Stock Exchange.  It was the first World Bank bond in Ireland in 25 years.  Both bonds build on last year's Irish sovereign &euro;3 billion green bond.  Ireland is just the fourth country in Europe to issue a green bond.  On Tuesday of this week the National Treasury Management Agency announced that &euro;1.95 billion of the &euro;3 billion available had already been allocated to eligible green projects.  Ireland will build on this by becoming the first country in the world to divest public money from fossil fuel companies and industries when the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2018 is enacted.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention some other notable green and sustainable finance achievements in recent months.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has become a member of the global coalition of finance Ministers for climate action.  The Central Bank of Ireland has joined more than 30 other central banks as a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System.  Since February, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has had climate change as one of its five priority investment themes.  Late last year Dublin was selected as the European headquarters of the United Nations' environmental and financial sustainability centres.  As we seek to build on this momentum and support Irish efforts in this area, we will publish a national sustainable finance road map for Ireland later this year.  This road map which will be a 2019 output of the Department's Ireland for Finance 2025 strategy will be launched during Ireland's second climate finance week which will take place from 4 to 8 November.  Irish capital market participants which have increasing expertise in green and sustainable finance will play a key role under the Government climate action plan by developing new products and services that can unlock capital to meet Irish needs and perhaps do likewise further afield.<\/p>  <p>  The direction of travel is clear.  Climate change is a fact.  It recognises no borders.  As the Minister of State with special responsibility for financial services, I will oversee implementation of the Ireland for Finance 2025 strategy.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve successfully our climate targets between now and 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700030#GG00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1561643700,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I want to say a few words about this important issue.  I am concerned that communities and workers affected by the transition to a low carbon economy seem to have been forgotten in the Government's new climate action plan.  The plan fails to reflect, even in part, the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action on a just transition.  It ignores the committee's recommendation that an independent \"Just Transition Task Force be established in 2019 to proactively consider the likely upcoming challenges of the forthcoming rapid transition\".  The plan merely refers to the establishment of a \"Just Transition Review Group\" within the National Economic and Social Council which is undertaking research this area.  It is not the appropriate forum to engage communities and workers.  The Government's plan also fails to address the central point in the joint committee's recommendations, that the just transition task force will need to apply itself to other industries and sectors, not just to the challenges faced by the midlands.  I am sure the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is aware of the significant challenges faced in that part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the European Commission highlighted the same failings in Ireland's draft climate report which was submitted to Brussels last year.  We often think the European Union is too rigid in the way it addresses issues in this country.  In this instance, it has emphasised that the plan should \"integrate just and fair transition aspects better, notably by providing more details on social, employment and skills impacts of planned policies and measures\", \"address the impact of the transition on the populations living in carbon-intensive regions\" and \"complement the approach to addressing energy poverty issues with indicative objectives for reducing energy poverty\".  There is no doubt that we will have energy poverty as a result of the plan.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action made precisely the same findings.  All members of the committee, including those from the Fine Gael Party, recommended that an independent task force be established to examine \"the social and employment impacts of climate policies\", address \"training and skills development\", identify \"social protection needs\" and develop \"local economic diversification plans\".  Will the Minister clarify the reasons for the categorical failure to take account of these recommendations?  Will he commit to amending the plan in accordance with them?<\/p>  <p>  It has been proposed to increase carbon tax between now and 2030.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been very clear that prior to any carbon tax increase, the Government must introduce specific measures to protect people who are vulnerable to fuel poverty and ring-fence revenues to assist people who are not in a position to transition from fossil fuels.  This is a significant issue in many parts of the country.  We welcome the ESRI's recent announcements on the issue and the recent consultation by the Department of Finance.  I ask the Minister to update the House in advance of budget 2020 on the introduction of these measures, particularly in the context of the need to combat energy poverty and support vulnerable households that will be affected by these plans.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the House learned of the significant environmental, economic and health impacts of biodiversity loss and the destruction of natural habitats.  The joint committee made it clear in its report that the implementation of several of its recommendations would have the double benefit of reducing emissions and supporting biodiversity.  There is a need for a new land use plan, new incentives under the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of hedgerows, forestry management initiatives and the restoration of peatlands.  As a result of an amendment proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, the link between the climate and biodiversity crises was reflected in the declaration by this House in May of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  However, the importance of biodiversity is largely absent from the new climate action plan.  The Minister seems to believe biodiversity is an entirely separate issue which should be dealt with by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I ask him to confirm that investment in biodiversity protection will be supported, including through the development of a national hedgerow conservation strategy, as recommended in the joint committee's report.<\/p><p> I am sure the Minister will agree that if we are to have this massive change in society - I believe we all agree there must be some aspect of change - he must bring his people with him.  If he does not have the people on his side to implement such change, he will not succeed.  That is the reason I am putting specific questions to him today because they are very important issues.  Regarding electric cars, what the Government is proposing is not implementable; it just cannot happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700030#GG00300","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561644300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>The specific part of the Government&rsquo;s action plan I wish to address is that related to the built environment, specifically the residential housing sector.  As the plan rightly points out, approximately 30% of our emissions come from the urban environment and a very significant portion of those come from our housing stock, which is using approximately 60% more energy than the EU average.  That reflects poorly on the quality of that stock.  One of the more alarming elements, according to the CSO data on the building energy ratings, it that is not only our old stock, as the housing stock built between the late 1990s and the mid to late 2000s is some of the poorest in terms of energy efficiency.  Alongside that, in the context of the just transition to which the previous Deputy referred, we need to acknowledge also that we have significant rates of fuel poverty.  Some estimates, although official figures are hard to come by, suggest that as many 400,000 people are experiencing some form of fuel poverty, which we need to take into account.  That means there are two major challenges.  I am not convinced by what I have read in the built environment section of the action plan that the Government has yet made up its mind on the specific actions it will take to address both the legacy of inefficient energy buildings and the challenges in terms of planning new building into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I will refer briefly to what I believe is needed and certainly what many people with far more expertise than me or the Minister on these matters believe is urgently needed.  With respect to retrofitting, there are three immediate challenges.  The first is the social housing stock.  While &euro;25 million was made available last year to bring some of the social housing stock to a higher building energy rating, BER, than where it is currently, it is still nowhere near enough in terms of the volume of funds or the energy efficiency improvements.  In many cases buildings are being brought from a D rating to a C rating or from an F rating to a D rating, rather than further up the scale.  That is not only a problem in terms of energy efficiency in meeting our climate change targets but many of these are the same households experiencing significant levels of fuel poverty.  We need to hear from the Government how much extra it will start investing in upgrading the social housing stock.<\/p>  <p>  The second challenge is funding for private home owners.  That is a major challenge.  None of us should underestimate the scale of the funds needed but all the experts are telling us we need a blended financing model of grant aid, albeit a reformed grant aid such as that currently provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and some form of Government backed low interest long&ndash;term loan, a system which operates in many other European jurisdictions.  Whether that is provided through a utility and the cost of repaying the loan is deducted from energy bills, or whether a low-interest loan is provided by Home Building Finance Ireland or some other fund, we need to move to a simple, easy-to-access blended finance model where, depending on one&rsquo;s income, one would get some level of grant aid and one would get an easy-to-access low-interest loan.  That means we need to take the advice both of the Tipperary Energy Agency and the SEAI that accessing both the finance and the works needs to become  much easier.  Rather than having a single one-stop shop, every local authority in the country should have something like the Tipperary Energy Agency to facilitate precisely that type of work.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to accept the fact that 340,000 residential properties are in the private rental sector, with one in four in Dublin.  Finding a way of ensuring all private rental properties meet adequate standards is something that seems to be strangely absent despite the small reference to tackling the issue of what is called the split incentives.  Many of the people concerned are low income earners and the big fear is that many of them would be hit with higher carbon tax charges.  As they do not own the property in which they live, they would not be in a position to make the energy efficiency upgrades required.  Therefore, that is an issue that urgently requires action.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue concerns new buildings.  While new building in not happening anywhere close to what is needed in the public or private sector, it is still increasing year on year.  While I welcome the fact there is a proposal to include in the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard in the regulations a phase-out date not only for oil boilers but for gas boilers, 2025 is far too late for that.  While there are some constraints in terms of skill levels within the sector, the priority should be to bring that forward much earlier in order that we do not have a situation where we are installing gas boilers in properties over the next five years only to have to then seek funding to retrofit to remove those in five or ten years' time.  We could be much more ambitious.<\/p>  <p>  We could go even further, particularly in the context of the new city and county development plans, and promote the very good technology and some good building practices among some of the public and private sector in terms of having fully passive buildings.  There is simply no reason those standards could not become the norm.  I would like to see us exceed rather than only meet the minimum standard with respect to the near zero energy building standard and become a world leader starting first in our public housing stock and then in all new private housing stock, so we get the highest quality new builds alongside a much more ambitious retrofit programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700031#HH00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1561644300,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The Government is trying to address a gigantic challenge.  It is a pity there was not more information in the details, including costings of the plan brought forward by the Government recently in respect of climate change.  I have said previously that climate change presents Ireland with a political challenge which is as important as Brexit, as demanding as the peace process and as costly as the financial crisis of the past decade.  If we look at climate change in that perspective, it is the biggest challenge.  It is one of the reasons younger people are so militant in their approach to wanting sensible and affordable change and change that meets the requirements of the savings we have to make as a society with respect to the reductions in our carbon emissions and putting them forward within a reasonable timeframe.  The timeframe the Government has put forward and the level of detail it has offered to the public are not convincing.<\/p>  <p>  Not too long ago, I ran a very well attended public meeting in Dublin 15 in Dublin West about climate change at which one of the speakers was Professor John FitzGerald, together with other experts on climate and climate change.  One of the issues that arose was for people who wanted to retrofit their homes and the question of who they would get to do that.  As Professor FitzGerald pointed out, we do not have a training system to produce the tradespeople and the small businesses that will be able to do retrofitting on a house-by-house basis for many of the older homes in every other part of Ireland, whether urban or rural.  We know already that the training of apprentices in SOLAS for the traditional apprenticeship trades is running at an extremely low ebb, notwithstanding that the building industry is desperately trying to recruit people.  What we are doing at present is a repeat of the previous boom of the early 2000s, whereby we are importing huge numbers of tradespeople from other countries to work in Ireland.  I agree with Professor FitzGerald that this is a fundamental change.  Unless somebody reputable can give householders an estimate of the best way to address the various issues in their homes, they will not be in a position to judge that.  We will be left with a situation where a huge amount of piecemeal retrofitting is being done; a bit of this, a bit of that.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has made a number of noises around the potential, for instance, to have credit loan schemes at cheap prices via institutions such as the credit unions in particular or to do it, in some cases, via utility bills.<\/p><p>There is merit in both of these suggestions.  However, the Minister must ensure that for those who are not technical experts, they can get serious advice which they can study and examine.  They must be able to meet somebody qualified who will not rip them off in telling them that they need to undertake works that will cost &euro;30,000.  Instead, they should be given a menu of actions which they can take on an affordable basis over time and in respect of which they can actually claw back the cost.<\/p> <p> Another area where the Government can receive a double dividend is maintaining hedgerows.  Hedgerows are being cut down at a ferocious rate by farmers who have been encouraged to do so by one side of agricultural policy.  The Government must promote the growing of trees in towns and cities.  Asthma and other major respiratory health problems affect young and old citizens.  If more trees and hedges could be planted in cities and towns, these health difficulties would be massively reduced.  That, in turn, would lead to a reduction in the burden on health services of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma, diseases which are costing the HSE massive amounts of time and money.  The Government could put in place several practical measures for the coming winter.  The tree planting season starts in late October and November and continues until March.  We could green cities and towns.  <\/p> <p> As for training apprentices, the academic year starts in September.  We could start immediately to ensure we will have qualified and reliable workers who will not rip people off.  That is what the public is afraid of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700031#HH00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561644900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>This is the only planet we have, but we are destroying it.  The destruction is being felt more in developing countries because of what we are doing in the developed world and the decisions we are making.  In Ireland there is an overall sense that we are not experiencing the destruction and disasters other countries are facing.  At times, we would not even know there was a climate emergency.  Therefore, it is good that we are talking about it now.  However, we have to move on from talking about it to taking action to deal with it.  We must accept that it will hurt all of us because we all have to play a part.  We cannot put the onus on any one sector, particularly as the international climate change treaties have been ineffective.  The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights warned that the impacts of global heating were likely to undermine not only basic rights to life, water, food and housing for hundreds of millions of people but also democracy and the rule of law.<\/p><p>We can say Ireland&rsquo;s record on climate change ranges from poor to extremely poor.  Granted, we did not have massive dirty industries like coal mining or heavy manufacturing.  However, we are more reactive than proactive.  That will cost us, both morally and financially, with targets being missed in 2020.  It is a case of we must do better.<\/p><p>In the developed world we have a responsibility to tackle climate change head on, not renegotiate targets or view the avoidance of fines as a win.  We must not use any loophole and not put profit above sustainability.  We must face up to the fact that the planet we will be leaving to future generations will be an adverse and a much less habitable place without that strong resolve.  The climate action plan is welcome, but it would have been more welcome in 2009 rather than 2019.  <\/p><p>Points were made about the carbon-proofing of budgets.  One of the particular actions in the plan is the electrification of transport vehicles and having more electric cars.  Recently, I had an experience with electric car infrastructure which proved that we were putting the cart before the horse.  I was travelling in an electric car from Dublin to west Cork.  Having an electric car means that one has to be super-prepared.  On our journey we stopped in Tipperary to charge the car.  Fortunately, neither of the two chargers in the garage was being used.  Otherwise, we would have had to wait one or two hours.  One must be able to do the sums in one's head to work out the remaining charge.  Heading into Cork city, we had to calculate the number of kilometres left in the charge and the number of kilometres we still had to travel.  The sums indicated that the car needed an extra charge.  We located a charger in a hotel, but we had to do two tours of the car park before we located it.  When we did find it, somebody else had parked in the bay, although they were not using it.  As it was a new car, phone calls had to be made to the ESB to connect to and disconnect from the charger.  On the way back, we had to calculate the number of kilometres to the nearest charging station because there was so little charge left.  It was slow to charge, at only 2 W.  It was at a different hotel and another tour to find the charger.  We got to a figure of 25 km after two hours of charging.  Granted, it did not cost anything, but it was a stressful journey.<\/p><p>Like many people, I had a petrol car, but I was encouraged to change to a diesel car which at the time was cheaper.  We are now being told to move to an electric car, but I am not convinced that we have all of the science just yet.  Lithium carbonate which is used in electric car batteries is selling at $11,500 per tonne.  Given the global demand for electric cars, there will be a significant increase in that figure.  Lithium is found in China, poor parts of Argentina, Chile and the Philippines.  It is to be found on lands which belong to indigenous peoples who are losing out.  Where is the tie-up if the countryside is being taken over to develop lithium mines to prevent climate change?  Chinese companies are buying up mines from Australia to South America and we could all get caught up in trade wars.  The annual revenues of two companies involved in this sector went from &euro;100 million to over &euro;1 billion in ten years.  The jump to using electric cars might just be a little premature and we might be coming back to search for another plan.<\/p><p>Agriculture is our Achilles heel, but all of the fault does not lie with it.  There is a need for more forestry.  It is good to see some supermarkets tackling the plastic packaging issue in a proactive way.  A report from Repak this morning stated Ireland was doing well in recycling.  However, this House could do much better.  When I was teaching, my school won numerous green flags and there was far more awareness of how to recycle among teenage girls than there is in this House.  We could start to look at ourselves like they do in the Bundestag.  If one was to check several bins in this building, one would find the same items in each, even though some of them can be recycled.<\/p><p>A recent article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>referred to climate apartheid, where the rich pay to escape the heat and the hunger caused by the escalating climate crisis, while the rest of the world suffers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700032#JJ00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1561644900,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about this matter.  Everyone agrees with the climate action plan when it comes to the better insulation of houses.  The more insulation one can use, the better.  However, the problem emerges when one looks at the price of insulation which ranges between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 which many in this country cannot afford.  They are the people who will not receive grants because they are above the thresholds, have youngsters in school or college and are repaying a big mortgage in what we call middle Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In agriculture 18% of the stock of cattle which go into the factories are produced in feedlots.  However, nobody has examined this issue.  It is not natural for cattle not to see daylight.  We were brought up in a tradition of farming where cattle were out for the summer and brought in for the winter.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not the Minister's fault as he has only been in the job a short time, the way carbon emissions have been added is a complete fraud.  Hedgerows were referred to.  As was said, farmers are not taking out hedgerows.  In fact, they are sowing them.  They did so before under the AEOS, agri-environment options scheme, and the REPS, rural environment protection scheme.  Between 6% and 10% of the country is covered in hedgerows.  However, we cannot sequester one tonne of carbon through the hedgerow network because it is not allowed for in our emissions calculations.  That is the fraud when one is adding the country&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  Once we go over a sequestration figure of 2.94 million tonnes in forestry, we are not allowed any more, even though the climate action plan states we can sow more forests.  What seems to be coming from the plan is that rural Ireland will be the sequester of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon, but, on top of this, its people will have to pay.  Nobody has a problem with reducing carbon emissions.  Farmers were always prepared to do their bit using traditional farming methods.  I am not talking about having big landlords, which is where we are headed in certain parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700032#JJ00300","speaker":"1341"}]
