It has been a pleasure to work with him in a very constructive way since I took up this position.  I wish him the very best in the European Parliament.  I have no doubt he will make a significant contribution there also.<\/p>  <p>  Regional development remains a key priority for me and my Department.  We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and my Department and its agencies have been working hard towards that goal.  Significant progress has been made.  For example, 58% of all IDA Ireland client-supported employment is now situated outside Dublin.  This figure represents the highest level of regional employment in the history of the agency.  Last year, IDA Ireland secured 113 regional investments.  This strong level of performance in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland is being maintained.  Last week, I announced IDA Ireland's mid-year results for 2019, which included 13,500 new jobs approved across the country, representing an increase of 19% on the equivalent period last year.  Indications are that further strong employment and investment growth will be achieved over the latter half of the year, which will lead to more economic opportunities across regional Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As I previously made clear, the availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment.  Not only does such a supply of properties help the agency to secure high-quality jobs, it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.  For that reason, it remains an important means by which IDA Ireland can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland owns 29 properties across Ireland.  Of these, 14 are occupied by agency clients, with the remainder available for prospective or existing investors.  It is important that IDA Ireland has such a supply of properties in order that it can better compete with other jurisdictions for job-rich investment and secure new projects for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700003#A00800","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1561627800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I accept that it is very difficult for a Minister to instruct industry or commerce to locate in a certain area.

The vast majority of IDA Ireland sites that are lying idle are located in the places that most need job creation and investment and which are very much struggling to attract multinational foreign direct investment, such as the Border region, the midlands and parts of the south east.  It is evident that this is having a direct impact on the commercial life of towns across the country.  In some towns, there are more shops boarded up than there are operating commercially.  There needs to be a refocusing and re-energising of investment in the regions and IDA Ireland plays a key role in that regard.  We must consistently advocate for the regions.

I thank Deputy Quinlivan for raising this issue.<\/p><p>Global competition for foreign direct investment, FDI, is as intense as ever.  We compete against many other countries and big cities from all over the world when it comes to securing new job-rich FDI from overseas.  That is why the IDA&rsquo;s main priority in its efforts is first of all win the projects, and to ensure that Ireland is selected by the firm in question.<\/p><p>Once that is achieved, which is a big achievement, the agency does everything it can to encourage companies to locate or expand into regional locations.  This is consistent with both the IDA&rsquo;s current policy, which has targeted an ambitious increase in regional investment by the end of 2019, and the Government&rsquo;s wider approach of strengthening enterprise all over Ireland.  This joint focus on the regions is yielding significant results, as was evident again from the IDA&rsquo;s mid-year jobs and investment figures for 2019, with 50% of jobs now located outside of Dublin.<\/p><p>The Government also wants our principal cities to remain highly attractive to multinational firms.  Dublin, in particular, with its international profile and track record as a home to many successful overseas companies, will continue to be a favoured destination for many investors, as evidenced again by recent job announcements.  That is very much a positive that we have a strong capital city to generate investment in the country as a whole.  It is also the case that our cities and regions are competing against the rest of the world, rather than against one another, for investment projects.<\/p><p>As regards the housing market, and in particular in increasing supply, that is well documented.  It is important to make clear that these difficulties are not attributable to multinational firms and the jobs they have created, whether in Dublin or elsewhere.  The root causes of our housing market difficulties are much more complicated than that, as the Deputy is aware.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s focus has been on addressing those housing problems and delivering fair and sustainable solutions over the short, medium and long term.  That is why we are implementing the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which includes financing measures, new construction and rental sector improvements.  As of the first quarter of 2019, there have been almost 19,000 new houses completed, an increase of 25% compared to the same time last year.  Dwellings in the Dublin and mid-east region account for over 60% of these completed properties.

But they understand too how much of a priority this is for Government and what has been done to increase supply.

That does not diminish our own housing challenges, which we remain determined to address, but it does serve as a reminder that these are problems that many others are also wrestling with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700004#B00600","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561628400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am not suggesting for a minute to the Minister of State that the IDA is causing or contributing to the housing crisis but there is a problem around housing.

That is the problem I am raising.  It is a sad state of affairs that due to the shambolic housing policy of the Government we have to be concerned about not having enough dwellings to house new workers and their families for the jobs that are being created here.  I understand that we are competing with the rest of the world for jobs and as I stated in my initial contribution I welcome every single job that is approved, whether that is for Dublin or for the regions.

I also met the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment during the development of the plan, under which the enterprise sector is being tasked with reducing greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions by between 10% and 15% by 2030.  Enterprises will also contribute to the more ambitious targets for buildings by reducing their emissions by 20% to 25% by 2030 and transport which will be reduced by 45% to 50% by 2030 through actions to improve their building energy performance and replace their fleets with electric vehicles over time.<\/p><p>My Department and its agencies are fully committed to the implementation of the actions identified in the plan.

Deputy Kelleher previously served in my office as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce and trade, where I know he was very popular with all of the staff.  I understand some of my staff worked with him during his tenure as Minister of State.  I wish the Deputy Kelleher well in his new role.  It is an important role.  Our future emanates from Europe and our MEPs have a lot of important work to do over the next five years.  The Deputy's experience in this House will stand to him as he takes on his new role in the European Parliament.  I wish him well.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to Deputy Browne's question, enterprise development and sustainable job creation in the regions is a key priority of the Government.  A total of 18,300 more people in the south east are in employment in quarter 1 2019 than there were in quarter 1 2015 when the regional action plan for jobs initiative was launched.  Unemployment has reduced from 11.7% to 6.7% in the same period.  The State average figure at quarter 1 2019 is 4.8%.<\/p>  <p>  While we have had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment,\u00a0in the context of Brexit and other global challenges, it is important that we move our focus to the creation of quality and sustainable jobs.  In this context, the Deputy has raised an important question.  Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet these challenges.  Launched last March, it includes ambitious targets and actions to drive the transformation of our economy. <\/p>  <p>  In the south east, there were 15,580 people employed across 76 IDA Ireland client companies in 2018, an increase of almost 7% on 2017.  The IDA will continue to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in the south east, promoting the region's strengths, including its ports and existing concentrations of financial services, IT and high-value manufacturing activities. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, there were 25,214 people employed in Enterprise Ireland, EI, supported companies in the south east, an increase of 5% over 2017.  Earlier this week, the Minister launched Enterprise Ireland's\u00a0new regional plan, Powering the Regions, which\u00a0sets out the focus of its activities in each region, including the south east.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10% and 15% in each region by the end 2020, from\u00a0quarter 1 2015, and to bring and-or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.  To this end, we recently launched nine new regional enterprise plans to 2020, which build on the  strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017.  Last March, we launched the south east plan, which covers counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford in Waterford, with strategic objectives focused on building enterprise resilience, marketing the region, a regional engagement strategy on key infrastructure priorities, ensuring the south east is a learning region, and tourism growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700007#E01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561630200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I do not get the sense that the Minister, the Minister of State, or the Government understand the position in the south east.

Numerous towns in the south east are consistently ranked among the lowest in terms of average incomes.  Wexford, in particular, is on the doorstep of Dublin.  It is linked by motorways, it has a significant population but it is not being serviced.  The south east also has one of the lowest numbers of IDA jobs.  There is no focus on address of the situation in the south east.

Future Jobs Ireland is a new medium-term economic framework aimed at ensuring our economy is resilient enough to withstand shocks in the future and agile enough to take advantage of opportunities when they arise.

Innovation drives productivity - as we all know - through new, higher value-added products and services and more efficient business processes.  Ireland continues to perform strongly in terms of innovation.

My Department and its agencies have consistently advised businesses that it is crucial they check their supply chains for vulnerabilities to Brexit impacts.

The LEOs are the first stop shop for advice on starting and growing a business locally.  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies to prepare for Brexit, including the Brexit scorecard, the Be Prepared grant, advisory clinics, the agile innovation fund, the operational excellence offer, the market discovery fund, online customs training and the Act On Initiative consultancy.

These nine new plans take into account new and emerging opportunities and challenges including Brexit.  I am pleased to say that implementation has commenced in all nine regions.  Shaped from the bottom up by regional stakeholders, which is important to point out, and overseen by my Department, the new plans complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the top down and there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and with the Government's Project Ireland 2040 and the Future Jobs Ireland initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  We launched the regional enterprise plan for the mid-west region, which covers Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, on 20 February at the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation site at Lisheen, County Tipperary.  The plan for the mid-west is focused on achieving impacts across five strategic objectives including developing the digital and innovation economy, progressing towards a low carbon economy, developing workforce skills, developing the capacity for economic growth and building a co-ordinated regional brand.  Each of the five objectives involves a focus on County Limerick as part of the mid-west region.  Initiatives to be pursued under the plan of significance for Limerick city and county include the development of an autonomous mobility testbed, the positioning of Limerick and the mid-west as a national centre for advanced manufacturing and the development of a sports technology cluster, building on the initial study by Limerick City and County Council.<\/p>  <p>  The strategic objectives and actions in the mid-west plan are set out alongside, and add value to, the enterprise agencies&rsquo; activities, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, and the LEOs' core activities in County Limerick and the wider mid-west region, including the recently launched Enterprise Ireland regional strategy, Powering the Regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700011#J01200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561632600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is prudent and innovative to move into those different clusters and not have a region be seen for just one specific cluster.

I have a written reply that will go on the record of the House and that will be available to the Deputy.  He is right that companies need to look at where they source their goods.  I recently met a company that imports oranges for jam-making.  It always imported the oranges from the UK.  With the support of Enterprise Ireland, it decided to look at new sources.  It now sources its oranges from Spain.  They are cheaper, better quality and make better jam.  Companies should look at their supply chain, where they can source different products and look to Europe where companies are guaranteed there will be no tariffs or disruption when importing from across the EU.  I thank Deputy Durkan for raising the issue.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In my role as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation I have met with many businesses throughout the country, in all regions, and across a variety of sectors.  I have been impressed with the levels of ambition, talent and creativity that I have seen in our companies.  I am committed, through my Department and my work with ministerial colleagues across Government, to helping these businesses to maximise their opportunities, to succeed in both domestic and international markets and fulfil their potential.<\/p><p>While we had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment from 16% to 4.4% today, we recognise the need to move our focus beyond numbers of jobs created to quality sustainable jobs and to building resilience in the enterprise base.<\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet all these challenges.  It includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy and it was developed based on extensive consultation with the business sector and other stakeholders.  In the context of Brexit preparedness, I also continue to chair a number of stakeholder grouping, including the Retail Consultation Forum, which has had a specific focus on Brexit over the last year and my Department's Trade and Investment Stakeholder Group, which meets roughly every six weeks.<\/p><p>Regarding import substitution, I have been consistently urging businesses of all sizes to put their supply chains under the microscope to check for risks and vulnerabilities to the UK.  Businesses could very well be exposed through their supply chain upstream, such as those who import ingredients, materials or components from the UK.  They may be impacted with tariffs or delays at the port, which could impact on cashflow and that is why we have put in place the Brexit Loan Scheme to help businesses to prepare.  Once businesses have assessed their supply chain&rsquo;s exposure there are a range of supports on offer from Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and the 31 local enterprise offices and information on what actions to take.<\/p><p>An important element of this commitment is my Department&rsquo;s annual Global Sourcing Initiative, helping EI clients to develop relationships with Irish based multinationals, through sales, partnership, R&amp;amp;D collaboration and innovation.  This year there were more than 400 meetings with 96 Ireland-based multinational companies and 188 Irish suppliers.<\/p><p>Another key priority for businesses looking to succeed is to focus on diversification.  Diversification is not just about markets, it also about diversifying into new products, new sectors and new methods of working.  It is, therefore, vital that Irish companies increase their levels of investment in innovation and R&amp;amp;D.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700011#J01900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561632600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1561633200,"counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700012#K00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1561633200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>As we gather in the Chamber our thoughts are very much in St. Columba's Church in Glenswilly as the funeral mass gets under way for the late Councillor Manus Kelly.

I want him to give a commitment to the House that the plan will be published before 11 July when the House goes into recess for the summer.  The letter in the article this morning outlined a number of concerns of HSE management and the officials in charge of implementing the plan.  There is one line in it that sums everything up, which is &quot;The additional impact now of the national children's hospital overrun over the years 2020\/2021\/2022 has made what was a very difficult situation almost impossible.&quot;  This is from the horse's mouth.  This is from the people in charge of the programme whose job it is to implement it.  However, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, continue to act as if there is no problem and continue to state there is nothing to see here and that they will manage the cost overruns and spread them out.  The Government published a list of projects that would be re-profiled.<\/p><p>The people on the ground and in charge of implementing this project have sent up a flag this morning.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's reaction to this?  The only political oversight of the national children's hospital during its inception related to the PR opportunities involved, and the photographs would happen at the right time.  There was oversight of yellow jackets, hard hats and cameras.  Meanwhile, the overspend continued to mount and now it will hit communities throughout the country.  This has been proven by the letter this morning.<\/p><p>The capital plan means new buildings, new facilities and new ambulances.  It is the essence of what is important in redesigning our health programme in line with the aspirations of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The then acting director general called it out for what it is.  As we speak, the director general and the Secretary General of the Department of Health are before the Committee of Public Accounts outlining the ongoing charges to the health budget.  This overspend has happened on the Government's watch.  Will he comment on the letter and commit to the publication of the HSE's capital plan for 2019?

Based on the outcome of the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process in December 2018, an additional &euro;100 million was required to fund the project this year.  The Government decided that &euro;24 million of this additional requirement would be provided from the health capital allocation.  The balance for 2019 of &euro;75 million will be met by rescheduling capital allocations in other Departments, which has been the subject of discussion in the Chamber many times.  This is out of a total proposed capital allocation in the State of &euro;7.33 billion in 2019.  It is important to note that this is an increase of &euro;1.33 billion, or 22%, on the 2018 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  The new children's hospital is a vital and much needed project and the Government has examined the funding pressures associated with delivering this important project.

I again ask the T&aacute;naiste to commit to publishing that plan before we go into recess in order that we can have a debate on it.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's comment on the fact that the then acting director general of the HSE stated the additional impact of the national children's hospital has made a very difficult situation almost impossible?  How does he respond to this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700012#K00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1561633200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Allocating capital resources in healthcare is always challenging.

In January, the Taoiseach stated no capital project would be delayed or cut as a result of the cost overrun in the children's hospital.  Only last Thursday, in the very seat in which the T&aacute;naiste is sitting, the Minister for Finance reiterated this position during Question Time.  He stated no project would be cut or delayed as a result of the cost overruns in the children's hospital.  In February, a draft capital plan by the HSE was discussed and it was almost ready to be signed off.<\/p><p>However, as a result of the information then given to the HSE on the cost overruns on the national children's hospital project, the capital plan had to be revisited.  We are coming up to 1 July and the plan has still not been published.  It is not possible for the Government to have it both ways.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance cannot state there is no impact on the capital projects which have been announced as a result of the cost overruns.  That is because this morning at the Committee of Public Accounts, leaving aside what the interim director general of the HSE, Ms O'Connor, said, the director general who is in the job some six weeks stated the very reason we did not have a capital plan published by the HSE was the direct result and consequences of the cost overruns on the national children's hospital project.  The HSE is still in negotiations with the Department of Health to see what impact the overruns will have on capital projects in 2020, 2021 and 2022. We have been trying to get the capital plan published for six months.  We are being told that there is no issue when it comes to capital projects and that there are no cuts or delays for budgetary reasons.  If that is the case, what has the HSE and the Department of Health been discussing for the past five to six months regarding the capital plan?  Why has it not been published?  It does not add up.  What the T&aacute;naiste is stating is not credible.  The overruns either have an impact and we are still trying to figure what it will be, which is why the plan has not been published, or there is politics going on and an attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes.  The overruns will either have an impact or they will not.

There were two parts to the project when it was first put before the members of Kerry County Council.  The first part runs from Lissivigeen to beyond Farranfore on the N22.  It is to run from Lissivigeen to Castlelough on the Muckross road on the N70.  It is a vital project which will reduce pressure and the number of accidents from Lissivigeen to beyond Farranfore.  There have been many fatalities at Coolcaslagh, Ballycasheen, the top of Lewis road, Madam's Hill and the Four Roads junction in Farranfore village.  At the last count, on the current bypass which is not sufficient, an estimated 18,600 vehicles passed by daily.  It is probably higher now.  The road links the Ring of Kerry, the Killorglin road and the Cork to Tralee road.<\/p>  <p>  The other leg will run from Lissivigeen to Castlelough to avoid the need for traffic from Kenmare and the Ring of Kerry to pass through the heart of Killarney town.  All of the traffic heading to other parts of the country would not have to use the Muckross road.  It would also mean that all of the traffic, the thousands of cars heading to Muckross House and Gardens and the national park would not have to pass through Killarney town and clog it up.  The Muckross road, the town, Mission road and Dr. Hans Liebherr Road become parking lots at certain times of the day because traffic cannot move.  On the one hand, it is good that we have this traffic into Killarney town which is the tourist capital of Ireland and where the tourism operators are second to none.  However, they need assistance at this stage to ensure their product will not be diminished by visitors complaining about being held up in traffic.<\/p><p>This project was first put in front of us in 2004.

The scheme provides for a bypass of Farranfore village, a new realigned N22, including a link into Killarney town, and an outer bypass of Killarney town.

Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, approval has now been issued to Kerry County Council to commence the procurement of technical advisers.  A defined route corridor already has been selected.  The project was suspended in 2010 or 2011 when there was no money.  The project appraisal plan was prepared in 2018 and it is now moving forward.

Coming from a working-class Protestant tradition, he ended up managing a shirt factory.  Championing the cause of the Catholic workers in his factory, he led the parades in 1968 and the famous Bloody Sunday parade in 1972, the source of so much of our Troubles.  We are in trouble again.<\/p>  <p>  After the murder of Lyra McKee almost two and a half months ago, Fr. Martin McGill asked why it had taken the death of a 29 year old woman for the parties of the North to come together again and commit to doing what they could to see a restoration of the Executive and the assembly in the North.  It was hoped that this would be concluded by the end of June.  I cannot see any sign of that eventuality whatsoever.  I presume that such hopes will be put aside with the marching season.  The difficulty is that when we return in September, we are likely to be in a most complex and fraught negotiating position with the UK Government over what is happening with Brexit.  It is highly unlikely that restoration could be carried out in such circumstances.  Then we will hit October.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday in the national economic dialogue, a no-deal Brexit is now highly likely.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the first deadline in March, Mr. David Penman, the general secretary of the trade union representing public servants in the North, said that civil servants could not take the kind of decisions that would need to be taken in such a scenario.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, said in the House of Commons that some direct application of powers would have to be put in place in those circumstances.  We would be back to direct rule.  The Good Friday Agreement would be in tatters and the environment which created the conditions for it would be gone.  We would face a no-deal scenario with many differences between the jurisdictions in the North and South.  We would have to manage that directly with Westminster Ministers with whom we would probably be in a very uncomfortable relationship.  We have a big problem with the Brexit issue but we have an even bigger problem with our immediate relations in the North.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, this is the T&aacute;naiste's responsibility.  What in the scenario I have just set out is likely to change?  How can we avoid ending up with direct rule in three or four months?  What can we do about it?  Will we slowly sleepwalk into an incredible political crisis on this island, as well as between this island and the neighbouring one?

With the support of all parties in the Oireachtas, we introduced the most extensive ever animal welfare legislation.  We agreed to review in detail the greyhound industry and how it was run.  To that end, an Indecon report was commissioned and its recommendations were acted on.  New legislation is in place on the back of it to change structures within the industry to ensure traceability can be delivered with no excuses.  I promise the House, having spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine this morning, that the illegality evident in last night's report will be followed up and that we will look to secure prosecutions where we can.  Just under 80 prosecutions have followed the introduction of the new animal welfare legislation, but there are other things on which we need to follow up, too.  If Irish greyhounds are being sent to the United Kingdom to be exported to parts of the world where we cannot guarantee their welfare, we will speak to the United Kingdom about it to try to shut it off.

He was Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for five years.  We are a nation of animal lovers.  Most people throughout the country were disgusted by what they saw on the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night which seemed to indicate a major wanton slaughter of greyhounds, numbering up to 6,000, year in year out, simply because they were not fast enough.  Also, there is the issue of the licensing of knackeries as the conditions in them seem appalling.  What actions will the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister responsible take in response to the reporting of these matters?  Many people throughout the country are outraged and want urgent action taken.  We have the new Act and I have the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill on the cl&aacute;r, which deals with the export of greyhounds.  We seem to have been told a pack of lies about such exports.  Greyhounds are being exported to countries with deplorable animal welfare conditions and nothing is being done about it.

We spoke about this issue this morning before Leaders' Questions.

It is not acceptable that greyhounds that are to be put down because of injury or whatever other reason are not put down in an appropriate manner with the supervision of a vet.  The days of sending a dog to the knackery or to the abattoir are long since over or they should be.  Illegal activity will be pursued.  We have the animal welfare legislation in place and new legislation for the greyhound industry to be able to ensure we have a proper transparent system that tracks where dogs are, who owns them, where they travel to, to whom they are sold and so on.  If there is over-breeding within this sector, which I suspect perhaps there is, that is also something the Government needs to look at from a policy perspective.  This is a sector the State significantly supports financially.  It is an important one.  It needs to be supported but it also needs to stamp illegal activity or animal welfare concerns, which were outlined last night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700017#P00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1561636200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I also wish Deputies Clare Daly, Wallace, Fitzgerald and Kelleher the very best.

The purpose of the legislation is to amend section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, which deals with the crime of possession of knives.  The Acting Chairman will be aware that there have recently been a number of significant criminal events involving the use of knives.  Last month a young man was killed with a knife in Dundrum.  Earlier this month a man was killed with a knife on O'Connell Street.  Two days ago, a woman was killed with a knife in the region of the Liberties in Dublin.  Unfortunately the crime statistics that are compiled do not give us specific detail on the number of homicides or assaults committed with a knife, but we do have some statistics that indicate that the use and carrying of knives is increasing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been able to provide information to the Minister, which he shared with me in the answer to a parliamentary question.  The number of knives seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately 66% since 2016.  In 2017, 1,600 knives were seized.  In 2018, 2,000 were seized.  From the recent terrible events and the statistics with which we have been provided, it seems that knives are being carried more frequently.  Unfortunately, it also appears to be the case that people are using knives, sometimes with fatal and tragic consequences.<\/p><p>As I have said, the purpose of this legislation is to amend section 9 of the 1990 Act.  This section deals with the possession of knives.  Section 9(7) deals with the penalties that can be imposed by a court on somebody who is convicted of possession of a knife.  The simple purpose of this legislation is to increase the maximum penal sentence that can be imposed upon a person who is found guilty on indictment of possession of a knife from five years to ten years.  At present the maximum penalty is five years.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes this should be increased to ten years.  <\/p><p>We are also fully aware that legislation cannot be the only response to this issue.  The legislation will seek to provide a greater deterrent to those who are contemplating carrying a knife but we need a much broader response, based in society, to the issue.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that many young men think it is appropriate, acceptable and, sometimes, necessary to carry a knife when going out.  The message needs to get across that this is not correct.  It is dangerous for them and for others and it can destroy lives, whether the life of a person stabbed with a knife or the life of a person who perpetrates such an act.  Many perpetrators do not go out with a knife on the day of the offence with the intention of causing harm.  They do so because they unwisely believe that it is necessary for their own defence.<\/p><p>In the neighbouring jurisdiction, and in London in particular, there is a chronic problem with the use of knives and the damage such use causes to younger people in particular.

The motion before the House is to approve the memorandum of understanding, MOU, agreed among the battle group participants arising from that decision.<\/p><p>The MOU relates solely to the administrative and technical arrangements for the operation of the battle group.  Any decision on a deployment of the proposed Defence Forces contingent on a battle group operation will require a further decision of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts.<\/p><p>Based on advice from the Office of the Attorney General, this MOU is not subject to approval by the D&aacute;il.  However, I previously gave a commitment, which I stand by, to bring the memorandum before the D&aacute;il, with due respect for transparency and the role of the House.<\/p><p>In commending the motion, I would like to outline the background to Ireland's participation in this EU battle group which will be led by Germany.  The EU aims to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises as and when they occur.  The purpose of the EU battle groups is to meet this objective and undertake operations as outlined in the Treaty on the European Union.  These operations, known as the Petersberg Tasks, which were further expanded in the Lisbon treaty, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking and peacebuilding, joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.<\/p><p>Ireland has worked to uphold the primacy of the role of the United Nations Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping, peace enforcement and crisis management operations, and our efforts at EU level to enhance EU-UN co-operation.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express its commitment to the UN and its principles.  In this regard, Members will recall that successive Secretaries General of the UN have endorsed the EU battle group concept and have encouraged and advocated for Ireland's participation in battle groups that could act in support of UN operations.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces contribution to this battle group will involve a special operations task group comprising a special operations forces platoon, engineer special search capability, explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, capability and a security platoon together with staff posts at force headquarters.  The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this battle group will be approximately 150.  This level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  The Defence Forces commitment leading up to and during the standby period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation will amount to ten personnel deployed to the battle group force headquarters in Germany.<\/p><p>The German battle group MOU is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely Germany, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Latvia and the Netherlands.  This agreement sets out principles on the operation, deployment and management of the German battle group.  The text of this agreement was laid in the Oireachtas Library in advance of our debate today.  Its terms are similar to those that Ireland has previously acceded to for the 2016 German battle group.<\/p><p>Each individual battle group participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  In Ireland's case, the triple lock requirement for the deployment of the Defence Forces contingent will remain unaffected by its accession to this memorandum of understanding.<\/p><p>Ireland's participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces.  It enhances Ireland&rsquo;s credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  It reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security and the UN.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700020#S00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1561638000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>My party is committed to, and embraces fully, the important role our Defence Forces play in peacekeeping operations.

We do not want all of this.  Leave it to others, if they want to become part and parcel of battle groups.  Battle groups are not peacekeepers.

For anyone with a tradition rooted in neutrality and peacekeeping, the instinct is to baulk at the idea of supporting such a thing.  EU battle groups exist in a state of preparedness to deploy within five to ten days of a Council decision to a range of possible missions, including crisis management and humanitarian assistance missions.  As is referenced in documents supplied by the Minister, the term \"battle group\" is unfortunate, as it is a standard, technical military term referring to a battalion-sized force with support elements, including logistics and transport.  This has been the Irish experience in battle groups since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that Ireland's participation in a battle group operation would be subject to the usual triple lock requirements of a UN mandate, Government approval and D&aacute;il approval, in accordance with the Defence Acts.  We in the Labour Party support Ireland's right to determine for itself on a case-by-case basis whether it will participate in any battle group operation.  As ever, the Labour Party is committed to protecting Ireland from involvement in any wars or battles of aggression.  We have a proud tradition as a neutral arbiter in world conflicts and are synonymous with peacekeeping and peacemaking.  Last week, we objected to the motion on sending troops to Mali, as we felt that it breached our standards of what kind of operations we should and should not be involved in.  This motion on EU battle groups does not breach that threshold.<\/p>  <p>  We need to have honest debates in this Chamber about our Defence Forces.  It is easy to vote against this on the basis of the name including the word \"battle\".  It is also easy to raise alarm bells about super armies and rampant militarisation, but we should vote on the detail of the motion and how it would play out practically in the real world.  Involvement in these battle groups provides the members of our Defence Forces with modern training and interesting exercises, and builds up positive relationships with our European partner states.  Some in this House might be happy to see our Defence Forces wallowing in domestic barracks with very little to do.  However, I have met members of our Defence Forces and know that they want to be active, to travel and to learn.  I want that for them as well.  They want to mix with other forces and exchange expertise and experiences.  Ultimately, our members can learn from these experiences and that assists in the practical application of peacekeeping, which is where Ireland's Defence Forces are in active operation.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to be honest and true to Defence Forces personnel and to our principles as a neutral state.  We have been in battle groups previously.  In 2008, 2011 and 2015, we were members of Nordic-led battle groups, and in 2016, a member of an EU battle group.  We have not compromised our values, nor have we supported sending our troops into any battle of aggression.  That will not change.  Arguments about European super armies are a red herring when it comes to battle groups.  There is no appetite in the Labour Party, this House or the country for us to be in any sort of super army.  The triple lock will remain in place and we are satisfied with those safeguards.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth acknowledging that the Minister did not have to bring the motion to the House for agreement.  He has done so to keep the House up to date and included in the plans and operations for our Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  If the House has not gathered it already, Labour will be support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700021#T00500","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1561638600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>There are times when debate in this House is surreal, and this is one of them.

Wars are always fought on the basis of false premises.  Humanitarian reasons have, since the beginning of conflict, been a tried and trusted reason that various imperialist powers have reached for.  A justification for First World War was the protection of Belgian refugees.  The 19th century French intervention in Syria was justified as being for humanitarian reasons.  The US invasion of Haiti in 1915 was for humanitarian reasons.  It stretches to the present day, through the first Gulf War in the 1990s and the later Gulf War based on the dodgy dossiers.  There were also the NATO interventions in Yugoslavia and Kosovo and, in 2011, the NATO-led attacks in Libya.  Imperialist interventions are often justified as being on the basis of humanitarian need so this is no exception.<\/p><p>Is it true, as Deputy Wallace has said in the past, that Ireland's participation in battle groups has resulted in our troops being trained in the use of armoured personnel carriers armed with 30 mm cannons, grenade launchers and other such advanced weaponry?

As Deputy Boyd Barrett did, I will quote the words of Angela Merkel.  Not only did she come out openly in favour of a European army, she also said that, in the long run, Europe must become more capable to act:<\/p><blockquote>We have to reconsider our ways of deciding and to renounce the principle of unanimity where the European treaties allow and wherever this is necessary.

It is all about financial gain for the French.  The Americans and others are there as well, as are the Chinese and Russians.

I strongly disagree with the fact that Shannon is being used by the US military to cause terrible destruction worldwide.  <\/p>  <p>  More than 60 million people are now displaced because of war.  The militarisation of the planet has gone off the Richter scale and we are now looking at a gradual militarisation of Europe.  It is very dangerous.  Money is now being taken from environmental projects in Europe to go towards military subsidy.  That is only subsidising the arms industry.  The lobbyists from that industry are wearing out the carpets in Europe to get what they want.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers named a number of so-called neutral countries that have also signed up to these battle groups.  Unfortunately, the number of countries in Europe that are prepared to stand up to the might of the military complex is zero.  We will take no credit from being in the same boat as them.<\/p>  <p>  This is the wrong path and that is an enormous problem.<\/p><p>Everybody seems to be interested in the environment all of a sudden, but there is no entity on the planet causing more problems for the environment than the United States military and its 4,800 bases worldwide.  There is no logic to us having anything to do with military expansion in Europe.  It is a huge mistake and not what the people want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700022#U00600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I wish Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly and the others elected to the European Parliament the very best.  I was present for Deputy Wallace's maiden speech and also present to listen to his leaving speech.  I hope they will not be gone for too long, but I wish them well and know that they will be good representatives in the European Parliament.  We will miss Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly from the Independent benches.<\/p>  <p>  I too have major concerns about the ongoing situation with the Army.  We know that the Defence Forces are being mistreated because the report of the Low Pay Commission has not been published.  We meet members of the Defence Forces every week in our clinics and although they cannot go on strike, they are being treated appallingly.  I am worried as week after week we are becoming involved in different issues across Europe and with the United Nations.  I am proud of our record in United Nations missions in conflicts around the world through the decades.  There are many people from Clonmel in the different representative organisations who have been to the Congo and elsewhere where it was very dangerous.<\/p>  <p>  The wording of the motion is blatant and there is reference to a \"battlegroup\".  Surely they could have called it some other kind of humanitarian mission and found a better name for it.  We have heard what Mrs. Merkel has said and should not sign up.  The Minister of State has listed the countries which are joining and implied that we should follow suit.  We have been punished enough for being the good boy in Europe and cheerleading.  The members of the battle group are Germany, Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Latvia and the Netherlands.  We do not have to be the best boy in the class in Europe as we were the best boy when money was shovelled in here to completely mess up the economy before we were fleeced in the so-called bailout, against which I voted and bitterly opposed.  This is a most serious matter.<\/p>  <p>  We must support our troops on UN missions but not in battle groups or similar positions.  We had a debate last week about sending them to Mali and such places which are very dangerous.  That was without having a proper debate or understanding of what went on in these countries.  Many other speakers have said that we do not have personnel to equip Naval Service ships or fly the limited aircraft we have available.  Soldiers are voting with their feet to leave because they are living in poverty.  We want to send them to join what is blatantly called a battle group.  If this is a neutral country, how can we add support to a battle group?  It is what it says on the tin.  It is not a peacekeeping mission.  If it was, why would they call it a battle group?<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what the Minister of State expects us to do.  There is already a coalition on many issues between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government and the Labour Party is also supporting the Government on this one.  I certainly will not be supporting it as I have the greatest of respect for our soldiers and what they have done.  We decided to send the Army Rangers off last week.  The Government should look after them and their families at home.  They should be treated with respect by the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, rather than being placed in more perilous positions.  Sometimes it is done with subterfuge and we do not know where troops are going, but the motion mentions \"battlegroup\".  I will not support the motion and many of my colleagues in the Rural Independents Group will not support it either.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the triple lock, which is meant to be great.  It is meant to be like having braces and a belt or two braces and two belts, but it will depend on the Government of the day and the majority it enjoys.  A Government can push a triple lock mechanism any way it likes and achieve the outcome it desires, but we need to tread cautiously and consider things carefully when we hear the comments we heard from Mrs. Angela Merkel whose country will lead the battle group.  We must make haste slowly and examine things carefully.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace mentioned the expanding use of Shannon Airport, with troops heading to different war zones around the world.  We are in a precarious enough time and should not be putting our soldiers in peril.  It is appalling that in the past 18 months two lots of peacekeepers who were ready to return home were left stranded, high and dry.  There were families waiting for them to attend weddings, First Holy Communion and other events.  They were stranded because of technical issues.  The Government should respect them by keeping them at home where they are safe.  They should go on United Nations missions but not with this kind of battle group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies across the House for their contributions.  Our previous experiences in participating in EU battle groups where countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden have led nations have all been very positive and valuable to members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the Defence Forces.  I again state how important our participation is in developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  This is vital for Ireland when deployed with other countries in peacekeeping operations.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated before, I have concerns about use of the name \"battlegroup\" as it sends the wrong message, but people should look beyond the name to the many positives in Ireland's participation in this mission.  I emphasise that battle groups, in common with all other capabilities under the Common Security and Defence Policy, have been developed to enable the European Union to carry out a range of crisis management tasks as outlined in the Lisbon treaty.  They include humanitarian rescue tasks.  In that context, it is possible that battle group formations could be called on to assist in large-scale complex emergencies where we would want to be useful and effective partners.  I have no doubt that if a humanitarian issue arose, many Deputies who will vote against the motion today would want us to assist.<\/p>  <p>  Participation in the battle group will have no effect on our traditional policy of military neutrality.  A commitment to a battle group does not involve any commitment to common or mutual defence.  Should a battle group be deployed, each battle group participant will retain the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  The deployment of the Defence Forces contingent as part of a battle group in peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations will continue to require an EU mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval, in accordance with the triple lock provisions of the Defence Acts.  This fact remains unaffected by Ireland being a signatory of the memorandum of understanding.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies spoke about an EU army.  The formation of a battle group is not a dry run for a European army as certain Deputies claim each time I bring any motion such as this before the House.  Some Members would love it if members of the Defence Forces rode to barracks in the morning and stayed there all day, except to shovel snow, help when there is flooding or cut trees, etc.  They do not want the Defence Forces to participate in anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00300","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Pay them properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>There is no housing in barracks any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>There are many-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00600","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>They should be paid properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700023#V00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1561639800,"counter":368,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.

Climate disruption is already having diverse and wide-ranging impacts on Ireland's environment and society, as well as on its economic and natural resources.  The climate action plan sets out an ambitious course in the coming years to address this issue.  The plan which represents an all-of-government approach to the climate challenge consists of 183 actions.  Its focus on renewable energy, for example, includes actions aimed at having 1 million electric vehicles in the State and retrofitting 500,000 homes by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment Deputy Bruton, said when he launched this important document, realising the plan will involve a radical change in the way we do things.  The plan will require considerable investment from public and private sector sources of funding.  According to some estimates, investment of &euro;50 billion or more will be needed.  If we are to meet the plan's objectives, we must harness private capital at home and abroad.  This can be achieved by Ireland which was one of the first countries to recognise the importance of green and sustainable finance.  The private equity funding stream is unavailable in Ireland as a result of the failure to date to pass through both Houses the investment limited partnership legislation which was published recently.  The deployment of capital for the decarbonisation of the economy and our society requires blended finance from Government sources, multilateral banking sources, borrowings and private equity.  When the investment limited partnership legislation is passed, all funding streams will be available in Ireland to make it a global centre of sustainable green finance.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, the Government has been steadily building a cluster of experts in this area.  Several Irish firms are considered to be global leaders in this sector.  There is critical mass of expertise in Dublin and Cork.  Over &euro;30 billion in green and sustainable funds are managed, listed or domiciled from Ireland.  Ten specific green and sustainable finance actions are included in the Ireland for Finance 2025 strategy which was launched by the Department of Finance recently.  This shows that activity is increasing at a fast pace.  The ESB recently issued a &euro;500 million green bond to support its decarbonisation efforts.  At an event jointly co-hosted by the Department of Finance and Sustainable Nation Ireland in May the World Bank issued and listed a &euro;1.5 billion sustainable bond on the Irish Stock Exchange.  It was the first World Bank bond in Ireland in 25 years.  Both bonds build on last year's Irish sovereign &euro;3 billion green bond.  Ireland is just the fourth country in Europe to issue a green bond.  On Tuesday of this week the National Treasury Management Agency announced that &euro;1.95 billion of the &euro;3 billion available had already been allocated to eligible green projects.  Ireland will build on this by becoming the first country in the world to divest public money from fossil fuel companies and industries when the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2018 is enacted.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention some other notable green and sustainable finance achievements in recent months.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has become a member of the global coalition of finance Ministers for climate action.  The Central Bank of Ireland has joined more than 30 other central banks as a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System.  Since February, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has had climate change as one of its five priority investment themes.  Late last year Dublin was selected as the European headquarters of the United Nations' environmental and financial sustainability centres.  As we seek to build on this momentum and support Irish efforts in this area, we will publish a national sustainable finance road map for Ireland later this year.  This road map which will be a 2019 output of the Department's Ireland for Finance 2025 strategy will be launched during Ireland's second climate finance week which will take place from 4 to 8 November.  Irish capital market participants which have increasing expertise in green and sustainable finance will play a key role under the Government climate action plan by developing new products and services that can unlock capital to meet Irish needs and perhaps do likewise further afield.<\/p>  <p>  The direction of travel is clear.  Climate change is a fact.  It recognises no borders.  As the Minister of State with special responsibility for financial services, I will oversee implementation of the Ireland for Finance 2025 strategy.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve successfully our climate targets between now and 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700030#GG00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1561643700,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I want to say a few words about this important issue.  I am concerned that communities and workers affected by the transition to a low carbon economy seem to have been forgotten in the Government's new climate action plan.  The plan fails to reflect, even in part, the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action on a just transition.  It ignores the committee's recommendation that an independent \"Just Transition Task Force be established in 2019 to proactively consider the likely upcoming challenges of the forthcoming rapid transition\".  The plan merely refers to the establishment of a \"Just Transition Review Group\" within the National Economic and Social Council which is undertaking research this area.  It is not the appropriate forum to engage communities and workers.  The Government's plan also fails to address the central point in the joint committee's recommendations, that the just transition task force will need to apply itself to other industries and sectors, not just to the challenges faced by the midlands.  I am sure the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is aware of the significant challenges faced in that part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the European Commission highlighted the same failings in Ireland's draft climate report which was submitted to Brussels last year.  We often think the European Union is too rigid in the way it addresses issues in this country.  In this instance, it has emphasised that the plan should \"integrate just and fair transition aspects better, notably by providing more details on social, employment and skills impacts of planned policies and measures\", \"address the impact of the transition on the populations living in carbon-intensive regions\" and \"complement the approach to addressing energy poverty issues with indicative objectives for reducing energy poverty\".  There is no doubt that we will have energy poverty as a result of the plan.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action made precisely the same findings.  All members of the committee, including those from the Fine Gael Party, recommended that an independent task force be established to examine \"the social and employment impacts of climate policies\", address \"training and skills development\", identify \"social protection needs\" and develop \"local economic diversification plans\".  Will the Minister clarify the reasons for the categorical failure to take account of these recommendations?  Will he commit to amending the plan in accordance with them?<\/p>  <p>  It has been proposed to increase carbon tax between now and 2030.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been very clear that prior to any carbon tax increase, the Government must introduce specific measures to protect people who are vulnerable to fuel poverty and ring-fence revenues to assist people who are not in a position to transition from fossil fuels.  This is a significant issue in many parts of the country.  We welcome the ESRI's recent announcements on the issue and the recent consultation by the Department of Finance.  I ask the Minister to update the House in advance of budget 2020 on the introduction of these measures, particularly in the context of the need to combat energy poverty and support vulnerable households that will be affected by these plans.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the House learned of the significant environmental, economic and health impacts of biodiversity loss and the destruction of natural habitats.  The joint committee made it clear in its report that the implementation of several of its recommendations would have the double benefit of reducing emissions and supporting biodiversity.  There is a need for a new land use plan, new incentives under the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of hedgerows, forestry management initiatives and the restoration of peatlands.  As a result of an amendment proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, the link between the climate and biodiversity crises was reflected in the declaration by this House in May of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  However, the importance of biodiversity is largely absent from the new climate action plan.  The Minister seems to believe biodiversity is an entirely separate issue which should be dealt with by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I ask him to confirm that investment in biodiversity protection will be supported, including through the development of a national hedgerow conservation strategy, as recommended in the joint committee's report.<\/p><p> I am sure the Minister will agree that if we are to have this massive change in society - I believe we all agree there must be some aspect of change - he must bring his people with him.  If he does not have the people on his side to implement such change, he will not succeed.  That is the reason I am putting specific questions to him today because they are very important issues.  Regarding electric cars, what the Government is proposing is not implementable; it just cannot happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700030#GG00300","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561644300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>The specific part of the Government&rsquo;s action plan I wish to address is that related to the built environment, specifically the residential housing sector.  As the plan rightly points out, approximately 30% of our emissions come from the urban environment and a very significant portion of those come from our housing stock, which is using approximately 60% more energy than the EU average.  That reflects poorly on the quality of that stock.  One of the more alarming elements, according to the CSO data on the building energy ratings, it that is not only our old stock, as the housing stock built between the late 1990s and the mid to late 2000s is some of the poorest in terms of energy efficiency.  Alongside that, in the context of the just transition to which the previous Deputy referred, we need to acknowledge also that we have significant rates of fuel poverty.  Some estimates, although official figures are hard to come by, suggest that as many 400,000 people are experiencing some form of fuel poverty, which we need to take into account.  That means there are two major challenges.  I am not convinced by what I have read in the built environment section of the action plan that the Government has yet made up its mind on the specific actions it will take to address both the legacy of inefficient energy buildings and the challenges in terms of planning new building into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I will refer briefly to what I believe is needed and certainly what many people with far more expertise than me or the Minister on these matters believe is urgently needed.  With respect to retrofitting, there are three immediate challenges.  The first is the social housing stock.  While &euro;25 million was made available last year to bring some of the social housing stock to a higher building energy rating, BER, than where it is currently, it is still nowhere near enough in terms of the volume of funds or the energy efficiency improvements.  In many cases buildings are being brought from a D rating to a C rating or from an F rating to a D rating, rather than further up the scale.  That is not only a problem in terms of energy efficiency in meeting our climate change targets but many of these are the same households experiencing significant levels of fuel poverty.  We need to hear from the Government how much extra it will start investing in upgrading the social housing stock.<\/p>  <p>  The second challenge is funding for private home owners.  That is a major challenge.  None of us should underestimate the scale of the funds needed but all the experts are telling us we need a blended financing model of grant aid, albeit a reformed grant aid such as that currently provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and some form of Government backed low interest long&ndash;term loan, a system which operates in many other European jurisdictions.  Whether that is provided through a utility and the cost of repaying the loan is deducted from energy bills, or whether a low-interest loan is provided by Home Building Finance Ireland or some other fund, we need to move to a simple, easy-to-access blended finance model where, depending on one&rsquo;s income, one would get some level of grant aid and one would get an easy-to-access low-interest loan.  That means we need to take the advice both of the Tipperary Energy Agency and the SEAI that accessing both the finance and the works needs to become  much easier.  Rather than having a single one-stop shop, every local authority in the country should have something like the Tipperary Energy Agency to facilitate precisely that type of work.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to accept the fact that 340,000 residential properties are in the private rental sector, with one in four in Dublin.  Finding a way of ensuring all private rental properties meet adequate standards is something that seems to be strangely absent despite the small reference to tackling the issue of what is called the split incentives.  Many of the people concerned are low income earners and the big fear is that many of them would be hit with higher carbon tax charges.  As they do not own the property in which they live, they would not be in a position to make the energy efficiency upgrades required.  Therefore, that is an issue that urgently requires action.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue concerns new buildings.  While new building in not happening anywhere close to what is needed in the public or private sector, it is still increasing year on year.  While I welcome the fact there is a proposal to include in the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard in the regulations a phase-out date not only for oil boilers but for gas boilers, 2025 is far too late for that.  While there are some constraints in terms of skill levels within the sector, the priority should be to bring that forward much earlier in order that we do not have a situation where we are installing gas boilers in properties over the next five years only to have to then seek funding to retrofit to remove those in five or ten years' time.  We could be much more ambitious.<\/p>  <p>  We could go even further, particularly in the context of the new city and county development plans, and promote the very good technology and some good building practices among some of the public and private sector in terms of having fully passive buildings.  There is simply no reason those standards could not become the norm.  I would like to see us exceed rather than only meet the minimum standard with respect to the near zero energy building standard and become a world leader starting first in our public housing stock and then in all new private housing stock, so we get the highest quality new builds alongside a much more ambitious retrofit programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700031#HH00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1561644300,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The Government is trying to address a gigantic challenge.  It is a pity there was not more information in the details, including costings of the plan brought forward by the Government recently in respect of climate change.  I have said previously that climate change presents Ireland with a political challenge which is as important as Brexit, as demanding as the peace process and as costly as the financial crisis of the past decade.  If we look at climate change in that perspective, it is the biggest challenge.  It is one of the reasons younger people are so militant in their approach to wanting sensible and affordable change and change that meets the requirements of the savings we have to make as a society with respect to the reductions in our carbon emissions and putting them forward within a reasonable timeframe.  The timeframe the Government has put forward and the level of detail it has offered to the public are not convincing.<\/p>  <p>  Not too long ago, I ran a very well attended public meeting in Dublin 15 in Dublin West about climate change at which one of the speakers was Professor John FitzGerald, together with other experts on climate and climate change.  One of the issues that arose was for people who wanted to retrofit their homes and the question of who they would get to do that.  As Professor FitzGerald pointed out, we do not have a training system to produce the tradespeople and the small businesses that will be able to do retrofitting on a house-by-house basis for many of the older homes in every other part of Ireland, whether urban or rural.  We know already that the training of apprentices in SOLAS for the traditional apprenticeship trades is running at an extremely low ebb, notwithstanding that the building industry is desperately trying to recruit people.  What we are doing at present is a repeat of the previous boom of the early 2000s, whereby we are importing huge numbers of tradespeople from other countries to work in Ireland.  I agree with Professor FitzGerald that this is a fundamental change.  Unless somebody reputable can give householders an estimate of the best way to address the various issues in their homes, they will not be in a position to judge that.  We will be left with a situation where a huge amount of piecemeal retrofitting is being done; a bit of this, a bit of that.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has made a number of noises around the potential, for instance, to have credit loan schemes at cheap prices via institutions such as the credit unions in particular or to do it, in some cases, via utility bills.<\/p><p>There is merit in both of these suggestions.  However, the Minister must ensure that for those who are not technical experts, they can get serious advice which they can study and examine.  They must be able to meet somebody qualified who will not rip them off in telling them that they need to undertake works that will cost &euro;30,000.  Instead, they should be given a menu of actions which they can take on an affordable basis over time and in respect of which they can actually claw back the cost.<\/p> <p> Another area where the Government can receive a double dividend is maintaining hedgerows.  Hedgerows are being cut down at a ferocious rate by farmers who have been encouraged to do so by one side of agricultural policy.  The Government must promote the growing of trees in towns and cities.  Asthma and other major respiratory health problems affect young and old citizens.  If more trees and hedges could be planted in cities and towns, these health difficulties would be massively reduced.  That, in turn, would lead to a reduction in the burden on health services of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma, diseases which are costing the HSE massive amounts of time and money.  The Government could put in place several practical measures for the coming winter.  The tree planting season starts in late October and November and continues until March.  We could green cities and towns.  <\/p> <p> As for training apprentices, the academic year starts in September.  We could start immediately to ensure we will have qualified and reliable workers who will not rip people off.  That is what the public is afraid of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700031#HH00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561644900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>This is the only planet we have, but we are destroying it.  The destruction is being felt more in developing countries because of what we are doing in the developed world and the decisions we are making.  In Ireland there is an overall sense that we are not experiencing the destruction and disasters other countries are facing.  At times, we would not even know there was a climate emergency.  Therefore, it is good that we are talking about it now.  However, we have to move on from talking about it to taking action to deal with it.  We must accept that it will hurt all of us because we all have to play a part.  We cannot put the onus on any one sector, particularly as the international climate change treaties have been ineffective.  The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights warned that the impacts of global heating were likely to undermine not only basic rights to life, water, food and housing for hundreds of millions of people but also democracy and the rule of law.<\/p><p>We can say Ireland&rsquo;s record on climate change ranges from poor to extremely poor.  Granted, we did not have massive dirty industries like coal mining or heavy manufacturing.  However, we are more reactive than proactive.  That will cost us, both morally and financially, with targets being missed in 2020.  It is a case of we must do better.<\/p><p>In the developed world we have a responsibility to tackle climate change head on, not renegotiate targets or view the avoidance of fines as a win.  We must not use any loophole and not put profit above sustainability.  We must face up to the fact that the planet we will be leaving to future generations will be an adverse and a much less habitable place without that strong resolve.  The climate action plan is welcome, but it would have been more welcome in 2009 rather than 2019.  <\/p><p>Points were made about the carbon-proofing of budgets.  One of the particular actions in the plan is the electrification of transport vehicles and having more electric cars.  Recently, I had an experience with electric car infrastructure which proved that we were putting the cart before the horse.  I was travelling in an electric car from Dublin to west Cork.  Having an electric car means that one has to be super-prepared.  On our journey we stopped in Tipperary to charge the car.  Fortunately, neither of the two chargers in the garage was being used.  Otherwise, we would have had to wait one or two hours.  One must be able to do the sums in one's head to work out the remaining charge.  Heading into Cork city, we had to calculate the number of kilometres left in the charge and the number of kilometres we still had to travel.  The sums indicated that the car needed an extra charge.  We located a charger in a hotel, but we had to do two tours of the car park before we located it.  When we did find it, somebody else had parked in the bay, although they were not using it.  As it was a new car, phone calls had to be made to the ESB to connect to and disconnect from the charger.  On the way back, we had to calculate the number of kilometres to the nearest charging station because there was so little charge left.  It was slow to charge, at only 2 W.  It was at a different hotel and another tour to find the charger.  We got to a figure of 25 km after two hours of charging.  Granted, it did not cost anything, but it was a stressful journey.<\/p><p>Like many people, I had a petrol car, but I was encouraged to change to a diesel car which at the time was cheaper.  We are now being told to move to an electric car, but I am not convinced that we have all of the science just yet.  Lithium carbonate which is used in electric car batteries is selling at $11,500 per tonne.  Given the global demand for electric cars, there will be a significant increase in that figure.  Lithium is found in China, poor parts of Argentina, Chile and the Philippines.  It is to be found on lands which belong to indigenous peoples who are losing out.  Where is the tie-up if the countryside is being taken over to develop lithium mines to prevent climate change?  Chinese companies are buying up mines from Australia to South America and we could all get caught up in trade wars.  The annual revenues of two companies involved in this sector went from &euro;100 million to over &euro;1 billion in ten years.  The jump to using electric cars might just be a little premature and we might be coming back to search for another plan.<\/p><p>Agriculture is our Achilles heel, but all of the fault does not lie with it.  There is a need for more forestry.  It is good to see some supermarkets tackling the plastic packaging issue in a proactive way.  A report from Repak this morning stated Ireland was doing well in recycling.  However, this House could do much better.  When I was teaching, my school won numerous green flags and there was far more awareness of how to recycle among teenage girls than there is in this House.  We could start to look at ourselves like they do in the Bundestag.  If one was to check several bins in this building, one would find the same items in each, even though some of them can be recycled.<\/p><p>A recent article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>referred to climate apartheid, where the rich pay to escape the heat and the hunger caused by the escalating climate crisis, while the rest of the world suffers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700032#JJ00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1561644900,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about this matter.  Everyone agrees with the climate action plan when it comes to the better insulation of houses.  The more insulation one can use, the better.  However, the problem emerges when one looks at the price of insulation which ranges between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 which many in this country cannot afford.  They are the people who will not receive grants because they are above the thresholds, have youngsters in school or college and are repaying a big mortgage in what we call middle Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In agriculture 18% of the stock of cattle which go into the factories are produced in feedlots.  However, nobody has examined this issue.  It is not natural for cattle not to see daylight.  We were brought up in a tradition of farming where cattle were out for the summer and brought in for the winter.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not the Minister's fault as he has only been in the job a short time, the way carbon emissions have been added is a complete fraud.  Hedgerows were referred to.  As was said, farmers are not taking out hedgerows.  In fact, they are sowing them.  They did so before under the AEOS, agri-environment options scheme, and the REPS, rural environment protection scheme.  Between 6% and 10% of the country is covered in hedgerows.  However, we cannot sequester one tonne of carbon through the hedgerow network because it is not allowed for in our emissions calculations.  That is the fraud when one is adding the country&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  Once we go over a sequestration figure of 2.94 million tonnes in forestry, we are not allowed any more, even though the climate action plan states we can sow more forests.  What seems to be coming from the plan is that rural Ireland will be the sequester of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon, but, on top of this, its people will have to pay.  Nobody has a problem with reducing carbon emissions.  Farmers were always prepared to do their bit using traditional farming methods.  I am not talking about having big landlords, which is where we are headed in certain parts of the country.<\/p><p>I heard a debate in the D&aacute;il the other day during which the Taoiseach said that we would get smaller lorries.  We will not get smaller lorries.  The reality is that changing a lorry from diesel to gas costs &euro;18,000.  The transport sector needs some help.  An electric car is 100% perfect for someone living in a city putting up a few thousand kilometres.  People in rural Ireland, from Roscommon or Galway for example, who have to drive 30 or 40 miles every day to get to work and come home were told by a Green Party Minister in 2009 to buy a diesel car.  It was promoted as being the best thing since the sliced pan.  They are now being told to get rid of it.  That Minister knew what he was talking about fairly well.<\/p> <p> There is now talk of forestry in rural Ireland.  Forestry is crucifying counties such as Leitrim and parts of Roscommon and Galway.  If forestry is put in everywhere people will not live in the area.<\/p> <p> The carbon tax is another big problem for rural Ireland.  Whether we like it or not, under the plan being promoted currently contractors will have to charge farmers an extra euro per bale.  This tax will cost farmers &euro;700 to &euro;800.  The media has said that a normal family will pay an extra &euro;700 or &euro;800 on diesel for their car and heating their house.  People will therefore be paying an extra &euro;1,400 to &euro;1,500 while working in sectors that are on their knees, such as the sheep and beef sectors.  At the same time we are promoting feedlots so that the slurry can be taken out and exported to tillage farmers.  We are allowing that, which will ensure that more cattle are kept in sheds.  That is fairly good planning for the future.<\/p> <p> Rural Ireland will not accept the carbon tax that is being talked about.  People in rural Ireland will not accept it until a LUAS, an Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann line, or a bus route passes by their doors.  One would not see a bus in a month of Sundays in some such places.  There is nothing and until there is the Minister should not be talking about crucifying these people, who are doing their bit.  They have no problem doing their bit when environmental schemes are brought in for farmers.  They have always done their bit.  Statistics show that the bee population in the west of Ireland has increased.  The amount of ammonia is low in the west of Ireland, which is very good.  Despite this, we are being thrown into the same package.<\/p> <p> I do not accept the media and politicians blaming people in the agricultural sector.  Let us remember that when this country was on its knees it was the agricultural sector that kept it afloat for the five or six years until we were back on the road again.  Now that the job market is moving, which we welcome, these people are kicked in the teeth again and let off.  We are having trouble bringing young people into farming, yet we are kicking the agricultural sector.  We are told that everything needs to be culled.  When it comes to traditional farmers and family farms, successive Governments down through the years have promoted the return of landlordism, driving people into the cities.  Let us look at where we were and at where we should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700032#JJ00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561645500,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I sat on the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We deliberated for eight months.  We spent many hours going through and teasing out what the Citizens' Assembly said.  I will pick up where Deputy Fitzmaurice left off and express my support for the agricultural sector in County Limerick.  The county is heavily dependant on the dairy sector.  Milking cows was of great help in pulling us out of the recession back in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.  We need to be mindful of that.  Agriculture is our natural resource in Ireland.  We do not have oil or any other natural resources.  Agriculture has been our natural resource and we need to mind it at all costs.<\/p>  <p>  We need to do this in a balanced fashion.  I have been speaking to the farming organisations.  I spoke to them as part of the work of the committee and farmers are willing to step up to the plate.  They understand that there will have to be changes and that a transition will have to take place, but this must be done in a balanced fashion and be phased in over time so that economic hurt is not felt while the transition takes place.  That has to be done across all sectors, which leads on to my next point, which is about public consultation.<\/p>  <p>  We see consultation happening and ideas coming forward here in the D&aacute;il.  People have spoken about the west of Ireland and I am speaking about Limerick.  Deputy Burton mentioned ratings and checklists with regard to retrofitting houses.  These are the ideas that are starting to come through that will affect and help people on the ground.  Public consultation is paramount.  I have said this to the Minister privately as well.  I welcome the fact that consultation has started.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, is starting a public consultation process, as are the Ministers, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Donohoe.  The committee specified that public consultation would be paramount in ensuring the success of our climate actions.  It will prevent misunderstandings and misinformation and will allow for peer-to-peer learning and discussions between people on the ground.  We need a bottom-up communication process because if we get this wrong and get the public's back up we will set ourselves back ten, 20 or 30 years.  That mistake has been made before when dealing with other issues.  We do not want to repeat it.  Public consultation and education are key to taking politics out of the issue.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said before in the Seanad, we have to avoid parties playing politics with this issue.  We must stick to the facts, help people and communicate with people because this affects us all.  This issue is not owned by any particular political party or group; it affects us all.  It is therefore paramount that we get it right.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Project Ireland 2040 and transport, I am a big believer in our economic development as well as our climate change policies.  I want to see the Cork-Limerick motorway and the N21 Limerick-Foynes route with the Adare bypass.  I want to see those projects proceed.  There is no reason to stop them or even to moot stopping them.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the public spending code is to be reformed to include a shadow price of carbon, a hypothetical surcharge on market prices for goods and services that involve significant carbon emissions.  This can be done in real time as each project comes up, whether in 2024, 2025, or 2026.  It is proposed that the shadow price of carbon will be &euro;32 per tonne in 2020, increasing to &euro;100 per tonne by 2030 and to &euro;265 per tonne by 2050.  Each of these projects can be costed in real time as they arise.  If, having been costed, they are stopped now, as has been suggested in other quarters, they will have to be costed again in 2024 or 2025.  They will have to be costed twice.  It totally defeats the purpose.<\/p>  <p>  We need to progress with these projects.  They are paramount for out economic development, particularly in County Limerick.  The Adare bypass has been needed for years.  The Limerick-Foynes route is required to service the deepwater port of Foynes.  It is a European tier 1 port.  Cork, Dublin and Foynes are our three tier 1 ports.  Foynes can be developed because it is not surrounded by a city: it is a small country town.  Such development would provide more jobs for the area and the greater mid-west region.  It also has a sister airport just across the Shannon.  Freight from Kildare is coming to Foynes to avoid the rush-hour bottlenecks in Dublin.  It takes an hour and a half or an hour and 40 minutes.  If this motorway is put in, the time to move freight will be brought right down.  That frees up the whole mid-west, which is important for balanced regional development.  It will bring people into rural Ireland.  The Cork-Limerick motorway is connected to this issue as well.  We can put electric vehicles on the motorway afterwards.  That would mitigate its effects in respect of climate change.<\/p>  <p>  A just transition and a lot of public consultation is required.  I encourage all parties to work together as we did on the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I started from a position of ignorance before getting where I am today in respect of climate action.  I learnt so much from the journey.  It is about leading on this issue.  How we lead will affect how future generations will perceive us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700033#KK00200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1561645500,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this issue.  The first thing we should recognise is that everybody has a contribution to make in reducing carbon emissions.  We have to face the facts and face reality.  To refuse to accept reality is to go in the wrong direction and if we do so we will be liable to really serious carbon charges in the future, which will accelerate much more rapidly than we think.<\/p>  <p>  We must consider the alternatives.  The biggest single contribution that can be made to carbon reduction is a change to the means used to generate electricity.  There are a variety of ways to do that which are carbon-free including wind, wave, solar and nuclear, although I do not agree with using nuclear energy and have never been in favour of it.  There is also biomass and a number of others.<\/p><p>I will go very quickly through them.  The best and safest method is wind energy.  We have a lot of wind in this country and plenty of places to put wind turbines.  Many communities do not accept the sight of wind turbines, but many in other counties do.  They are making a reasonable contribution to the generation of electricity at the moment.  We frequently hear of the considerable research on wave energy.  However, that has gone on for 20 years and we have not yet seen the results to any great extent.  However, with wind energy, big results can be achieved in a short time.<\/p> <p> Some people have proposed biomass to replace coal burning in Moneypoint, County Clare.  That is not a realistic option I am afraid.  It would require the planting of biomass in at least half the country and we would need to import the other half just to keep the one station going.  In addition, that happens to be the biggest polluting station with 1,000 MW currently.  Taking that 1,000 MW out of the system and replacing it with clean generation would mark a serious effort.  If that is multiplied by five or six, we are into self-sufficiency.<\/p> <p> We need to recognise that various types of trees have a positive contribution to make to carbon sequestration.  For example, the unfortunate and much maligned Sitka spruce is the best with up to four times the capacity of an ash, oak or one of the other broadleaf species.  We need to interplant between broadleaf and spruce trees to give ourselves the best options.<\/p> <p> The next method is simple.  I have shifted over and rely heavily on a wood-burning stove, which has significant beneficial effects.  However, somebody was happy to produce a report in the past six months or so to the effect that the burning of wood allows particles into the air that cause serious congestion problems for persons with asthmatic conditions and so on.  The people who produced that report were not necessarily physicians; they were more likely to be proponents of another type of energy generation.<\/p> <p> The use of electric cars will make a major contribution to achieving the results we need.  It is where the electricity for that transport is generated that brings it to its most satisfactory conclusion.  We need to bring the two issues together - the generation and the use of electric vehicles.  Given the bigger and heavier engine requirements in agriculture and construction generally, it will probably need to come from something like hydrogen as an electric engine of 200 or 300 horsepower, which is required in today's modern machinery, is very much in its infancy and I have concerns about the battery for that.<\/p> <p> Solar energy is an option.  It is not big in generating electricity.  Five acres generates 1 MW whereas one wind turbine can generate up to 5 MW of electricity.  There is a significant difference in the space taken up.<\/p> <p> We need to acknowledge how the farming community has managed the environment over the years.  Everything that grows absorbs carbon.  Many of the things that grow such as trees are carbon neutral.  They only emit what they have absorbed over their growing life.  I can speak more on that some other time, but I do not have time today.<\/p> <p> I support the Government's plan.  In recent years, I have attended incisive meetings in my constituency and others where I heard people with contrary views to mine.  The predictions I made ten years ago are coming through faster than I thought and certainly faster than many of my opponents thought. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700033#KK00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561646100,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate, but five minutes is a ridiculously short time for each Member's contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to start with the good stuff the Government is doing in tackling climate change, particularly in the transport area.  Public transport in Dublin is being transformed and will continue to be transformed by MetroLink, BusConnects and the DART expansion.  I hope they will proceed with the consent of everybody.  I acknowledge there are issues regarding MetroLink, which have been addressed by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I praise the NTA for its commitment, research, and capacity to listen and change plans if needs be.<\/p>  <p>  I live in a constituency where an increasing number of people commute.  The DART expansion to Drogheda to will have a major beneficial effect, planned, as it is, with new hybrid diesel trains.

It should be fast-tracked so that people can connect from the estuary to the city as their schedule of work demands.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague from Roscommon made an important point regarding rural versus urban interests.  We do not need to have this conflict in our society - similar to the yellow vest problems in France - with rural communities up in arms against increases in taxes, which is exactly what Deputy Fitzmaurice was talking about.  What is needed is prior notice, consultation, and encouraging and supporting change particularly in rural communities that are adversely impacted but do not have public transport because of the low density of population in them.

The car park is compliments of the work of very forward-looking councillors some 15 years ago, namely, Councillors Alan Farrell, Darragh O'Brien, Leo Varadkar and Clare Daly, who all supported the zoning of that plan.  I thank Deputy O'Dowd for mentioning it.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to contribute to this debate on our climate action plan and climate change in general.  It is one of the foremost threats facing our country and the globe.  For too long, there has been much inaction when it comes to addressing climate change and I am pleased that the Government has brought forward comprehensive plans to fulfil our responsibility to the environment.  It is important that we acknowledge collectively the work of the all-party Oireachtas committee.  As Deputy Neville mentioned, the committee took eight months to come to this position.  I welcome the involvement of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the climate action plan, which has been brought forward for debate.<\/p>  <p>  One key finding in the committee's report, and a central part of the climate action plan, is that we continue to work towards the banning of single-use plastics.  That is incredibly important.  Such a simple change could have a positive impact on how we care for our environment.  In the average supermarket selling the usual items, it is astounding just how hard it is to avoid buying plastic and non-degradable fruit trays and packaging.  The onus is very much on the citizens of the State to make changes in what they do, how they do it and what they buy.  However, it is also incredibly important for our supermarkets, retailers more generally, and manufacturers to re-evaluate how they produce the products they provide us with and whether there is a reasonable level of recycling in this country.  We are ahead of target on our green recycling and have been for many yeas, but we clearly need to do more.<\/p>  <p>  Polystyrene should be much more readily recycled.  There is often a reluctance to take empty packaging back to the store in which it was bought for recycling, but in most cases the store will take it.  However, we have to ask ourselves whether the packaging was really required in the first instance.  Often, computer screens and phones will come in polyethylene packaging, which is, I think, called SPI 4 and is not currently recycled in this State.  We must take steps either to eradicate these materials from supply chains or to ensure that they are recycled here.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that we change the source of our energy from the current reliance on oil, gas and peat to more renewable resources.  A conversation must take place around wind, wave and solar energy, heat pumps and other sources of electricity and their promotion.  Homeowners must be able to generate their own energy and small and medium-sized enterprises should be encouraged to erect electricity generation stations, whether that be turbines or otherwise.  I welcome the fact that, separate from this plan, homeowners will be able to feed back into the network the energy that they do not use.  In this country there is massive potential to harness renewable energy, particularly given our Atlantic coastline.<\/p>  <p>  My final point is on the retrofit scheme, which I am pleased with.  I welcome the Department's announcement that the adaptation and retrofitting grants are being upgraded.  However, as I have said privately to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, it is important for this State to recognise the BER standard of a property when considering eligibility for such schemes and not the date when the property was built.  Unfortunately, there is a legacy in this country of the implementation of building standards being at best haphazard and at worst bordering on criminal.  That is true for work done to a large number of properties well after the closing date for the current grants available to homeowners to upgrade.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that this plan be supported by as many Members of the House as possible, from all parties.  We have to have a realistic conversation, among ourselves and with the public, as to how we are going to achieve this and what changes we as individuals must make to ensure that we stave off the worst effects of climate change, which we see every day across the globe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700035#MM00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1561646700,"counter":452,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that everyone in the House acknowledges the scale of the climate change challenge facing Ireland and the level of transformation required if we are to see a meaningful decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.  That challenge needed a step up in ambition and renewed determination across Government and society to tackle climate disruption.  The climate action plan gives us this required level of focus and drive.  For my part, I am strongly committed to ensuring that decarbonising transport remains a key priority and that the sector continues to contribute to our national decarbonisation efforts.<\/p>  <p>  The transport sector accounts for a little over one quarter of Ireland's non-ETS emissions, and there can be no question but that transport must feature strongly in our approach to tackling the problem.  A wide-ranging set of bold and challenging actions for transport is set out in the climate action plan, particularly in the areas of public transport and active travel.  I want to make sure that public and active travel options are a viable alternative for as many people as possible and for more of their journeys than ever before.<\/p>  <p>  I am ambitious to ensure that, between now and 2035, more than half a million extra journeys per day will be taken either on public transport or by walking and cycling.  This ambition is supported by the &euro;8.6 billion investment secured under Project Ireland 2040 for sustainable mobility.  This investment in new public transport and active travel projects is well above that for new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment in these two areas.  An investment of &euro;8.6 billion is transformative.  It will be used to greatly expand our public and active travel range through key projects such as BusConnects, MetroLink and DART expansion, as well as enhancing the cycling and walking infrastructure in all our major cities. We have a clear plan of action for improving and greening our public and active travel offerings.<\/p>  <p>  With more than half of transport emissions coming from private cars, we must work harder to shift people from using their private cars to greener ways of travel.  However, this can tackle only a limited set of journeys and emissions.  To really reduce transport emissions, we must decarbonise private cars.  Globally, electric vehicles are the leading solution to the decarbonisation problem.  It is the Government's job to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making the greener choice and selecting electric vehicles, now and in the years to come. Through a combination of incentives and a positive policy environment, we have seen sales of electric cars increase and there are now approximately 11,500 electric vehicles registered.<\/p><p>We know the technology is getting better.  Driving ranges are improving, more models are becoming available and, most importantly, the cars themselves are becoming cheaper.  As the technology gets better and cheaper, we will continue incentives and investment in the charging network.  We are ambitious that, with a real push, we can make progress towards getting the electric vehicles we need on the road by 2030.<\/p> <p> That target of almost 950,000 vehicles is a very challenging one and demonstrates the scale of transformation required across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceilings.  Now is not the time to underestimate the size of the task ahead: it is the time for action.<\/p> <p> As we have done with the low emissions vehicles task force, my Department and I will work closely with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and their Departments to map out the new policy pathway that will be necessary.  It will, of course, require widespread support to be effective and I am committed to ensuring that the necessary broad consultations will take place.<\/p> <p> I am strongly committed to the decarbonisation of transport agenda and, as we saw last year, I hope to see further falls in transport emissions in the years ahead.  Every sector must step up to the challenge if Ireland is to get on track for 2030 and beyond. <\/p> <p> I commend the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for bringing this plan to fruition and look forward to working closely with him and my fellow Ministers to ensure the plan's success and place Ireland on the right trajectory to tackle climate disruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700035#MM00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561647300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>First, I thank the Deputies who participated in this debate.  A wide number of issues have been raised and I understand why people are expressing fear about the impact on different communities.  That is always going to be the case when we face the significant change that is required of us.  I ask people who have expressed such fears to show a little forbearance about thinking what the future of our community will be like if we postpone all of this change.  That is an important question.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a family farm background and recognise that our agriculture depends on exporting.  We need people who are committed to buying our products because of the high standards to which we produce them.  That is increasingly becoming a feature of the marketplace.  I have been on a number of trade missions promoting Irish food and it is really important to think that through.  If we start to rail against the unfairness of the changes that we, as a relatively prosperous country, have signed up to at international level and point the finger at other countries that should be doing far more, we run the risk of undermining the whole effort with absolutely catastrophic consequences for the global community.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we think of what will future proof homes, family farms and enterprises in ten, 15 and 20 years' time when, as we know, carbon is going to be valued at &euro;265 per tonne.  That is the world in which we will be living and we must ensure that the choices we make now mean our families will be best placed to be resilient in that new world that is opening up.<\/p>  <p>  It is not an accident that the next generation is pointing its finger at us and saying we have failed it.  It is really important that we think this through.  Deputy Neville compared the Joint Committee on Climate Action to the debate around the repeal of eight amendment of the Constitution.  Many people went into that committee with views that were fairly fixed but not altogether based on having evaluated the evidence and found that the evidence, when they looked at it, was different.  Some people came out of that committee strongly endorsing the Teagasc action plan as something that should be done and also endorsing the need to have a signal in carbon pricing that ensures we do not lock ourselves into carbon dependent assets that will become stranded assets in the years to come, dependence on which would lock us into very poor lifestyles that would undermine the well-being of our generations to come.<\/p>  <p>  I understand why people ask how this will be done and how we will make the change.  Those are legitimate questions.  The way I look at it is that those who postpone change will face the highest costs and be left with the fewest opportunities.  If we can start now and trace a roadmap to delivering these things, we will deliver significant change.  The changes will be challenging.  We need the fabric and heating systems of one third of existing homes significantly improved.  One third of vehicles on the road need to be electric and non-carbon emitting by 2030.  We need to expand massively the amount of renewable energy we put onto our system using wind resources and other alternatives to the fuels that are now doing such damage.  These are big changes but we have, as a community, been able to make big changes before.  We pride ourselves in having the pragmatic flexibility to do it.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we try and stay together as a community to deliver this.  Brendan Behan used to say the first item on the agenda of any new organisation was the split.  If we do not stay together, we will fail the generation that is knocking at our door and saying we need to make radical change.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot go through, in five minutes, the many worthy comments that were made in this debate.  I assure Deputies that this is the start of a process where we are determined to achieve the necessary change.  This plan is not set in stone.  As new ideas emerge, we will adapt and change the plan.  It is important that we start by recognising that every part of our community, be it enterprise, agriculture, homes, public service or waste management, needs to make a contribution.  This plan has tried to allocate that fairly across those sectors.  We must work together with those communities to achieve this.  At the end of the process, we will have warmer homes, cleaner air, resilient enterprises and farms that can stick the test of the changes that are rapidly coming down the tracks.  The goal we are trying to achieve here is well worth the effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700036#NN00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1561647300,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Can the Minister answer the question I asked?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700036#NN00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1561647300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The Minister did say there were too many worthy questions for him to respond to in five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700036#NN00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1561647300,"counter":457,"content":"<p>How are we going to ring-fence money with the carbon tax coming?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700036#NN00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1561647300,"counter":458,"content":"<p>As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has a consultation out until the end of this month which is asking people to submit their views as to how that is being done.

If the Minister of State in a position to give any information on those, as they have not yet been published on the Department's website, we might be able to have a conversation about the broader homeless crisis in my response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700037#OO00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1561647900,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for the opportunity to clarify what is happening.  I do not have the numbers referred to by the Deputy but I am happy to discuss the general point.  We naturally hope the good work happening during each month is demonstrated in the figures.  Although the figures are far too high, quite a number of families are helped at a much earlier stage now and we find them homes much more quickly.  The numbers are still high, as both we and the Deputy know, so there is no disputing that.  Progress is made every month working with different families, so I hope that will be evident in the figures coming in the days or weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The homeless hostel mentioned operated from Br&uacute; Aimsir since 2015.  As the Deputy mentioned, this was always intended to be a temporary facility and was due to close at the end of March 2016.  However, the closure was subsequently deferred and is only taking place now in the context of the DRHE having put in place additional enhanced facilities for those who used the service.  The DRHE is continuously working to ensure there is an adequate supply of emergency accommodation so there is shelter available for those at risk of rough sleeping.  At least 200 new permanent emergency beds have been introduced in the Dublin region each year under Rebuilding Ireland.  At all times we try to ensure there are enough beds in the system, as well as upgrading those beds and making them more suitable for the needs of people.  Every year we engage with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and service providers to try to ensure we have enough capacity in the system, which I believe we do.  The capacity is generally there.<\/p>  <p>  Br&uacute; Aimsir had capacity to accommodate 105 individuals and the DRHE has opened 120 new beds to replace those previously provided at this facility.  By 10 July, the executive will increase the supply of new emergency beds by a further 45.  This will mean 165 new beds will have been provided.  The majority of the new beds being put in place will be supported temporary accommodation, where individuals will be provided with a 24-hour service and will receive the housing and health supports they need to exit homelessness.  It is a more enhanced service than they received at Br&uacute; Aimsir.  It is still very much a temporary emergency service, and I am not saying people would want to live there permanently.  However, it is better that this will be a 24-hour service and people will not be asked to leave in the morning.  We try to ensure to provide that option in most of our emergency bed accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy and others that the DRHE has confirmed that nobody in Br&uacute; Aimsir will be left without accommodation.  We have engaged with Depaul in that regard to ensure nobody will be left without accommodation.  Supporting rough sleepers is a priority for the Government.  We also recognise that many of those engaged in rough sleeping have significant health support needs, particularly in the area of mental health and addiction.  The Deputy referenced the other needs of these individuals.  In addition, we are focused on the delivery of long-term solutions for these individuals beyond providing emergency accommodation, which is of course essential but must be matched by the necessary wrap-around support services.<\/p>  <p>  We have introduced a Housing First model in Ireland that has worked quite well in other countries, namely Finland, Canada and elsewhere.  It is a good model and I am glad it is rolling out in a few other countries this month and next month as well.  The Government introduced the Housing First national implementation plan, which is a joint initiative of the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Health, the HSE and local authorities.  The plan enables rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation, who have complex needs, to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive supports to help them maintain their tenancies.  The plan sets targets to create more than 660 Housing First tenancies in the period to 2021.  It is all the better if we can do more but that is certainly the minimum.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the national implementation plan being launched, Housing First operated as a pilot project in Dublin.  The Dublin region Housing First service has housed 276 homeless individuals to date, 87% of whom have successfully retained housing, which is a major positive.  Following a tendering process by the DRHE, the Peter McVerry Trust will operate this service to deliver a further 400 Housing First tenancies over the next three years.  A complementary street outreach service operated by Dublin Simon Community is assertively engaging with people who are sleeping rough in the Dublin region to support them into temporary accommodation and long-term housing options.  Both services commenced on 1 June.  Addressing the complex needs of rough sleepers and people in emergency accommodation will continue to be given the highest priority by the Government.  We have personnel on the streets every night of the week trying to encourage rough sleepers to avail of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700037#OO00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1561647900,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The DRHE put it on record earlier this week that nobody would be left without accommodation.  The questions I hope the Minister of State will answer are a little more detailed so perhaps I will go through them again.  We know the facility is closing but when will that happen?  It is an important piece of information.  My understanding is that prior to it closing, it will have approximately 95 residents.  I would like to be assured that not only will they all have a roof over their heads but that the location they are going to will be appropriate in that it should at least be within the city centre.  Support services must continue, whether provided by Depaul or others.  I have had some conversations with Dublin City Council officials and they have told me approximately 70 of the individuals will move from the night-to-night facilities to locations with 24-hour service provision.  Will the Minister of State confirm if that is the case and who is making that provision?  That would be welcome.<\/p>  <p>  A further 25 individuals will go to supported temporary accommodation, which I presume are six-month placements with a private room or at least a room only shared with one individual.  Will the Minister of State confirm that?  Will he also confirm that all the accommodation that these individuals will go to will be run by voluntary sector providers and that hotels or temporary private sector emergency accommodation will not be used?  There is no suggestion that will happen but if he puts it on the record, it would be welcome.<\/p>  <p>  His reply mentions increasing the capacity by 120 beds.  Is he saying those 120 beds that were opened had not been occupied prior to the winding down of Br&uacute; Aimsir and they were opened specifically for the purpose of accommodating, in the first instance, the 95 to 105 individuals who on any given night would be in the hostel?  Are they other beds that have been opened?  I am seeking the maximum amount of information and my intentions are genuine.  What I am hearing from Dublin City Council is giving me less cause for concern than when I first heard the news.  Nevertheless, the more information that can be put in the public domain, the better it would be for everybody, and particularly those who use the Br&uacute; Aimsir service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700037#OO00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1561648500,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin seems to have plenty of information but I understand he wants to put it on the record of the House, and there is no problem doing that.  If I do not have the full answers to any of the questions he asked, I will get them for him.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that they are 120 new beds to replace the previous beds and that they will be run by different service providers.  I cannot give the Deputy a list.  I have a fair idea of the locations but I will not put them on the record, and I am conscious the Deputy did not ask for the individual locations.  They are run by a number of different organisations and I can get that list for him also.<\/p>  <p>  To clarify again, these will be enhanced services providing 24-hour beds in most cases and beds for longer periods in other cases.  With all our emergency provision our aim to ensure that 24-hour option is available, and the six-month option in many other cases, which is much better for many clients.  Everybody agrees it is not ideal that people have to leave 24-hour emergency accommodation the next morning, so that is our aim.  In total, there will be 165 new beds - 120 plus another 45 beds that I understand will open on 10 July.  The aim was that the facility would close today, 27 June.  I presume that has happened.

As we all know, community centres are a cornerstone of many communities around the country.  They provide a vital function, bringing together members of the community for social, educational and informational purposes.  We need community centres open and working well in communities because they help tie all communities together, particularly new, developing communities.  As Members of this House, we see on a daily basis the benefits of a strong community centre for a local community.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Community and Rural Development, supports such important initiatives through, for example, the community enhancement programme, which provides small capital grants to community groups in this area.  It is not a direct funding line from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, facilities where people gather need to be fire safe.  That is probably the issue causing the difficulty in this community centre.  I understand that issues in that regard have arisen in respect of the community centre in Hartstown and that Hartstown community centre is doing everything within its power to address these and work through those requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility for safety is assigned to the person having control of a building, who is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire.  That would include ensuring that all necessary fire prevention measures are in place.<\/p>  <p>  To meet their duties, operators of buildings, in general, should have arrangements in place to prevent fires occurring through control of ignition sources, such as electrical equipment, and regular removal of combustible waste.  Additionally, early warning in the event of fire is important, along with arrangements to ensure safe evacuation of occupants, including those who may require assistance, such as the very young or elderly people.<\/p>  <p>  Buildings need to be maintained in good condition, particularly in terms of fire protection equipment therein, such as fire detection and alarm systems, emergency lighting, fire-resisting doorsets, and the fabric of the building.  Regular fire drills should be arranged to ensure that people know what to do in the event of fire.  <\/p>  <p>  Record keeping in respect of all of these matters assists those having control of premises in ensuring, and demonstrating, that they are meeting their statutory duties.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of a fire service in its functional area is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003.  A fire authority may give advice on fire safety to the owner or occupier of any premises or to any person having control over any premises.  If it has not happened already, it may be useful to the community centre to engage with Dublin Fire Brigade on the issues that have arisen.  We have found that they engage on these issues with many individuals in dwellings, apartment blocks or community centres are proactive in working with them on that in terms the solutions and what has to be done.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the funding is an issue.

The north quays in Waterford is the site of a proposed &euro;350 million regeneration project that will be a game-changer for the city.  This opportunity has presented itself through the hard work and efforts of Waterford City and County Council under the leadership of its CEO, Mr. Michael Walsh.  The proposed investment in Waterford city by the Alhokair Group from Saudi Arabia has provided a much-needed confidence boost for the city and the whole south east.<\/p>  <p>  The south east needs a regional city of consequence and that must be Waterford.  The city must be enabled for propulsive growth.  For regions to be strong, they need a strong city.  However, this project is so much more, with an impact on additional permanent services such as healthcare, education and transport.  It would also have significant economic benefits.  The development is planned on approximately 17 acres of substantial and spectacular river frontage.  The proposal includes development of a total of 60,000 sq. m to include retail units, leisure and office space, 200 apartments and a relocated train station, which will result in an integrated transport hub.  This will provide a sustainable transport corridor and improve access from north to south by creating a pedestrian bridge linking the north quays to the south quays and the remainder of the city centre.  The north quays development will increase Waterford&rsquo;s retail offering by 50%.  It is envisaged that 2,300 direct jobs will be created on completion of the project.  <\/p>  <p>  The planning application for the project is extensive.  The scale of the documentation is enormous and the application is cognisant of all regulatory guidelines.  The cost alone of printing the documents is around &euro;120,000, which gives an idea of the work that has already gone into this project.  I understand the planning application will be lodged in coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Waterford can and must act as a release valve for the pressure that is building in the capital.  The city and county council has done an amazing job in getting the project to the current stage with the support of politicians, Waterford Chamber of Commerce, the Alhokair Group and other stakeholders.  Under the national planning framework, on which the Minister of State has worked hard, Waterford metropolitan area has been designated for population growth of up to 30,000.  If Waterford is to realise this aspiration, the development of the north quays is crucial.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Waterford City and County Council applied for funding of &euro;20.1 million from the urban regeneration and development fund for the first phase of this development. <\/p><p>It received &euro;6 million, which is well short of what is required.  We need to see how seriously the Government views promoting regional economic development.  What we need from the Government today is certainty, commitment and clarity.  We need certainty that the Government fully supports this vital project, commitment to the finance required over the next three to four years and clarity as to when and how the finance will be allocated to progress this vital project.  When will the 2019 tranche of funding be allocated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700039#QQ00700","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561649700,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Butler for raising this important matter and for giving me another opportunity to discuss and clarify it.  It is a project with which I am very familiar.  I am also familiar with the site.  It is a project of which we are very supportive and rightly so.  It is very important if we are to achieve our ambition in Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework.  It is very important that we follow up national plans through local implementation.  I compliment all involved in the north quays project in Waterford and, in particular, Waterford City and County Council&rsquo;s efforts in leading on it, along with the support of the chambers, many others and politicians, as Deputy Butler rightly said.  Along the way it was important that everyone was able to play their part in helping.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss Waterford City and County Council's bid for funding for the north quays under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, which is part of Project Ireland 2040.  In 2016, the north quays area in Waterford was the subject of a strategic development zone, SDZ, order made by the Government, recognising the social and economic importance of the site to the State, and designating the Waterford north quays for mixed use development, subject to preparation of an SDZ planning scheme, which has since been completed.<\/p>  <p>  The national planning framework launched in February 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040 includes objectives to achieve more compact urban growth in Ireland&rsquo;s cities, including the significant further development of Waterford city and to move development away from the east coast to all of our other cities.  Further to the national planning framework, the ten year URDF, worth &euro;2 billion to 2027, was established, with &euro;550 million of committed Exchequer grant funding available to 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, bids were invited from public bodies for funding support from the URDF.  On 26 November 2018, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, announced initial support of &euro;100 million in provisional allocations to a total of 88 projects throughout the country.  As part of this first tranche of approvals, the Waterford north quays project was allocated support of &euro;6 million.  A large and complex integrated urban project, the Waterford north quays proposal, includes significant high cost capital elements.  Under the first URDF call for proposals, the council submitted a bid for URDF funding, which included four significant elements.  These were relocation of the city's railway station to the east to form a new public transport interchange; a new pedestrian, cyclist and public transport bridge and associated urban greenway; site access roads and road realignment; and off-site roads in the wider north bank of the Suir area in Waterford and Kilkenny.  It is intended that the infrastructural works involved will open up the north quays site, making it more accessible and supporting the achievement of the objectives of the SDZ planning scheme more generally.<\/p>  <p>  The overall project is one of the more complex URDF proposals and it is essential that careful consideration be given to the proper advancement of its design, planning, procurement and construction.  I recognise that all of the promoters involved have big plans with a lot of detail and they are very committed to the project.  The initial URDF support to Waterford, as with all other successful bid proposals, is approved in principle and is subject to a finalised agreement between the Department and Waterford City and County Council.  I have said before, and I say again, that it has to be seen as a starting point in a programme of ongoing support for a significant city centre urban renewal project.  This is a very clear commitment from the Government.  We stress that it is a starting point.  There is an initial tranche and we will need to continue with the work.  Deputy Butler should recognise this as support and backing up our plans, commitments and recognition of projects of significant value to the region and Waterford city.  In this regard, the Department is continuing to engage with Waterford City and County Council on advancement of the overall project to agree project composition and sequencing and establish project cost certainty to inform current and future URDF funding support and allocations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700040#RR00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1561649700,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his commitment to this project and I welcome the fact he has said the initial URDF support to Waterford as well as other successful bid proposals is approved in principle and is subject to a finalised agreement between the Department and Waterford City and County Council.  I acknowledge what he said about it being a starting point but I need to reiterate that it is very important to state it is extremely unlikely that the project will get over the line without State funding.  A total of &euro;13 million is required in 2019 to start the process and a commitment of &euro;90 million is needed over the next three to four years.  Much of the infrastructure development involved in the project would have had to come in future anyway.  What this project is doing is accelerating this hugely important infrastructure and increasing connectivity between the north and the south of the city.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainable transport infrastructure is the essence of this project and development of this site can and will act as a catalyst for the city and county of Waterford and the entire south east.  The employment opportunities, housing opportunities and health opportunities cannot be underestimated.  The north quays development will act as a catalyst for all these things because it will lead to population growth and to Waterford and the south east acting as a release valve for the overcrowding in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that what is needed in the project to drive it forward at this stage is certainty, commitment and clarity.  As the project goes to planning in the next couple of weeks, Waterford City and County Council and the developers need clarity on funding and a timeframe for the funding because this is such an important opportunity for the people of Waterford city and county and we have to make sure it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700040#RR00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1561649700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Butler for raising this issue.  The URDF is focused on supporting projects that will assist regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland's five cities and other large towns and enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed use development to deliver within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns.  I reiterate that we are very supportive of the project.  It will ensure that more parts of rural urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people can choose to live and work as well as enabling them to be able to win greater investment and make it more attractive to visit.<\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the aim of the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040 more widely, the URDF represents a more enlightened approach to the provision of Government support and a movement away from silo policies, thinking and funding of the past, which has held back many of our cities and towns.  Through the fund we offer targeted integrated support for innovative holistic solutions to the issues that for too long have prevented the regeneration and rejuvenation of our cities and towns.  It is anticipated that the continuation of the URDF in 2020 and beyond will facilitate a greater focus on integrated urban projects such as the north quays in Waterford, as these proposals require sufficient time for design, planning, procurement and construction to be advanced properly.  The Government is only one of the stakeholders and Deputy Butler mentioned some of the others.  It is important that we are seen as part of the funding mechanism.  The taxpayer cannot facilitate all of it.  The fund is about making it happen and giving the Government's stamp of approval.  It is all about releasing other matched funding.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated earlier, the Department has already engaged with Waterford City and County Council and will continue to do so to discuss the progression of the proposal in 2019 and onwards, with the intention of agreeing the project composition with regard to URDF support and future funding allocations.  We do see the importance of this for the city, the south-east region and the regions beyond it and for achieving our aims in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is sitting beside me.  We can look back over the past seven or eight years at the support we have given to and the focus we have put on the south-east area and the city of Waterford, starting with the Action Plan for Jobs and the south-east plan for jobs.  The employment situation in that area has been transformed.  We recognise there is still more work to do to complete this journey and to future-proof the area so it can continue to win investment and jobs.  People have to see there has been a strong commitment to the south-east region over the past seven or eight years from the Government because we are committed to it.  I want to say on the record that we are committed to it through this funding model in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Another example of this is the recent announcement of support for the regional airport.  I am surprised by a lot of the commentary around it.  To me it was a very wise decision.  Regional airports transform an area.  Kerry is a prime example and we can also look at Knock.  The local commentary was positive but did not take on the national commentary questioning the logic behind it.  It makes total and utter sense, certainly when it releases other supportive funding from other stakeholders and brings in private capital.  We get best value for taxpayers' money through using it to match private money.  We have always said a mixture of public and private enterprise coming together to drive an area is key but people seem to knock it.  The Deputy should be making it very clear so people see the commitment to Waterford city and county and the surrounding region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700040#RR00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","time":1561650300,"counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700041#SS00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1561650300,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I express my solidarity with the more than 200 workers who find themselves in a position where they are going to lose their jobs.  There are some 240 jobs, 161 part time and 79 full time, on the line at the Cork mails centre.  I anticipate that the Minister will tell us he has no operational involvement in decisions of this nature.  It is important, however, that we have an opportunity to raise our concerns about this decision.  Those concerns are based on the fact that it is difficult to see the justification for the closure of this mails centre.  An Post is telling us that its operating profit last year was &euro;41 million and that there was a 7% rise in revenue as well as a 40% rise in parcels volumes.  The company's justification for the closure of the Cork plant is that the centre is operating 25% below capacity due to the decline in traditional mails volumes.  It is difficult for me, and the workers, to reconcile that fact with the 40% rise in the parcels delivery volume last year.  That surely represents an opportunity.  If that business is growing, An Post should ensure that all of its sorting and mails centres are included within the mix.<\/p>  <p>  The people of Cork are disgusted by An Post's decision to cull, in a very political way, the Cork mails centre because they see no justification for this decision.  The excuse that there is a decline in traditional mails when the evidence shows an increase in revenue from the rise in parcels volumes does not stand up to scrutiny.  The decision is made and I note that the narrative has now moved on to trying to get the best deal possible for the workers.  Let us remember that there are 161 part-time workers and 79 full-time workers.  I raise this issue because we have to understand, at a time when parcel volumes are increasing across various business sectors, why An Post is excising one of its key centres and sacrificing one of its mail centres.  To my mind, that does not stand up to scrutiny.  I am raising this with the Minister because it is important that there is a political response from the Government regarding this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700041#SS00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1561650300,"counter":499,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that this is a difficult day for the workers directly affected by this decision.  I assure the Deputy that not only will good terms and conditions be offered to the workers but every support will also be made available by the company and, indeed, by the State to support them at this difficult time.  The company has outlined some of the supports that will be provided.  These include efforts to redeploy staff as well as offers of support for training and education.  The centre will be phased out and continuing support will be offered.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Sherlock raised the question of why a company undergoing difficult structural change should make a decision like this.  I am conscious that some years ago An Post's survival was on the line.  That was the reality given the long-term decline of its mails operation.  The company needed to dramatically diversify its business.  It entered into negotiations with its workforce to try to devise a strategy to make a successful transition.  A modest pay agreement was part of that strategy but there was also a structural plan which involved the closure of one of its mail centres.  The difficulty is that there is a long-term structural decline in mails volume, as the Deputy recognises.  An Post had too much capacity in that area but not enough capacity in the areas where it sought to grow, including in new services, such as financial services through the post office network and online services as well as parcel delivery services.  An Post has successfully done that following the changes which were negotiated. <\/p>  <p>  The company's announcement makes it clear that while it was forced to make this decision, which was part of the original negotiated deal, it is also making a significant investment in the Cork region.  It is doing that to put the company in a position to build out the opportunity in parcels delivery.  An Post is making a conscious decision to expand its capacity in that area and it has listed some of the investments it will be making.  These include parcels lockers, a major parcels delivery centre, and a new electric, zero emissions, delivery fleet.  The company is, therefore, upgrading and changing its business model to meet the new opportunity.  There is no doubt that this is a painful decision.  It is being taken, however, in the best interests of making sure that the company can continue to deliver a quality service to its customers, ensure it is attuned to changing needs and can secure the future for its workers by making the plans and changes necessary to support An Post's prosperity into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Sherlock is, of course, right that, under legislation, we do entrust day-to-day decision-making on these matters not to Ministers but to the company.  The Deputy will have been here last week when the case was being made for another of the centres that it was felt was under threat.  It would be very invidious if these decisions were taken on a political basis.  They had to be taken by the company, based on its assessment of the best interests of the company, its customers and its workers.  This is a disappointing day for those people who have been adversely affected but the closure has nothing to do with the very high quality of workmanship that was being delivered in Cork.  This decision is being taken in the long-term interests of the company's capacity to sustain employment and service its customer base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700041#SS00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1561650300,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Is that not the point?  We do not know which of the centres was the most efficient.  We have not had sight of the McKinsey report so we do not know for sure which of the centres was the least efficient.  This was a political decision.  I believe An Post went for the political path of least resistance.  The Cork mails centre was sacrificed on the altar on that basis.  I was hoping that in Government circles there would have been a greater degree of resistance by those at Cabinet and that there would have been some fight for Cork.  That has not been the case, as it transpires.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a prediction.  I forecast that this is the beginning of the end of the universal service obligation and the five-day delivery service.  We are starting to get rid of mails centres and post offices and that is clothed in the pretence of investment in the General Post Office, GPO, on Oliver Plunkett Street and a new delivery unit being opened in Skibbereen.  Those are all welcome changes but they are piecemeal.  The structural long-term objective of An Post is to go down to a three, a two or even a one-day delivery service in certain parts of the country.  That is where we are heading and that has to be called out.  If we do not stand up for jobs in Cork and for what could be a viable business, which could operate at capacity, on the basis of the argument that An Post itself makes regarding a significant rise in parcels volumes, then I think that is bad day for the postal service in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700041#SS00400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1561650300,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I have to disagree with the Deputy.

That is the obligation of An Post.  The Deputy has to recognise that any company that wants to survive must accept that what customers want is changing.  A company that continues to do what it has always done and refuses to look at what would copperfasten its future will not survive for very long.  At one stage An Post was looking down the barrel of this reality and restructured.  I agree absolutely that this is a very disappointing day for the workers in Cork who have been exemplary in their service.  Nonetheless, it is an important part of a process by which the company will become strong for the future.  The 1,000 people who work for the company in Cork can know that the company will sustain their livelihoods based on a sound business model.

It is unbelievable this issue has been ongoing for more than two years.  When the Bill was selected in the lottery, I asked myself whether it still had any relevance.  I spoke to people on the ground who were involved in the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, across the State.  After conversations with them, the importance of the Bill and why it needed to be progressed really hit home.  It is more relevant now than ever.  One volunteer at MABS to whom I spoke described the Citizens Information Board, CIB, as the most toxic organisation with which he had ever dealt.  They are the words of a volunteer who has nothing to gain in raising concerns about the CIB.  He volunteers to ensure the delivery of services at MABS for his community and receives absolutely nothing for his work.<\/p>  <p>  The CIB appears to be intent on destroying the community ethos fostered by MABS since it began in 1992.  It is that very community ethos that made MABS unique in the work that it did in assisting individuals and families at hugely difficult times in their lives - situations that involved personal debt in struggling with their mortgage, credit card debt and debts owed to moneylenders.  MABS has provided immense support for people in financial distress and in assisting citizens in communities across the State it did what nobody else was there to do.  I take the opportunity to wholeheartedly commend all of those who have volunteered with MABS since 1992.  I refer to those who give of their time for no monetary gain, who simply want to assist people in their communities by ensuring the smooth running of the service.  They are a credit to the communities in which they have served for many years.  I also mention the commitment and hard work of the MABS national management forum and those in the MABS national development offices in Blanchardstown who have worked tirelessly to ensure the people in need of the service are always kept at the centre of everything that they do.<\/p>  <p>  It should be a matter of deep regret for the Government that it sat back in 2017 when the CIB announced its intentions to make changes to the way in which MABS operated.  The major restructuring plans announced by the CIB were opposed by those involved in MABS.  The CIB never sought or heard the views of those actually deliver the service on the ground.  The damage the restructuring would do was outlined to the Government in black and white on several occasions, yet those concerns were ignored.  The restructuring which is now complete has seen this damage, unfortunately, come to pass.<\/p>  <p>  Ahead of this debate my office reached out to every MABS office in the State to seek views on the restructuring and make staff aware of the Bill.  I received several emails in reply.  Two were from regional managers who told me of their opposition to the Bill and informed me of the benefits of the restructuring and the support they had received from the CIB.  I would not expect them to say anything else, given the fact that they are employed directly by the CIB.  The third email was sent anonymously by a MABS staff member who was terrified to disclose his or her identity.  As they put it, it was because \"some colleagues who were previously very vocal about the absurdity of the restructure plan are being targeted.\"  This staff member spoke about the fear and stress felt among the staff.  It should equally be a matter of deep regret for the Minster and the Government that many MABS staff have already left the organisation, either through early retirement or to move to another job.  That is what the restructuring has meant for the highly knowledgeable and experienced people on the front line in MABS.<\/p>  <p>  I have been stunned by the information I have received from MABS volunteers on their treatment at the hands of CIB board members.  I am utterly appalled by board members' treatment of MABS members and volunteers.  As a result of that information, I am deeply concerned about the future of the MABS service.  I do not say this lightly.  In a recent reply to me the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, explained that the restructuring had been undertaken in order to deal with governance issues.  What were those governance issues?  They have never been explained to us either in the House or at the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection which held a series of meetings on this important issue.  Nobody seems to know and some have been asking this question since 2017.  The Minister and her predecessor - the Taoiseach - know this quite well.  The Taoiseach also dealt with this issue during his tenure as Minister for Social Protection.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s reply cited a figure of &euro;668,240 as the total cost of the restructuring, yet that is not the final cost.  Eight regional managers will be paid a salary, which represents an additional and ongoing cost, that will be paid for years to come.  Doubtless, it is a very fine salary.  The Minister also stated the benefits in service delivery to MABS clients were evident and that the service had been enhanced.<\/p><p>What are these benefits?  I have yet to see them.  People on the ground have yet to see them.  As far as I can see, there are no benefits whatsoever.  How has the service been enhanced for users?  It has not been enhanced at all.  In fact, waiting times for appointments for members of the public have increased and have continued to grow since the restructuring.  Morale among MABS staff is on the floor.  We are seeing the loss of experienced and highly qualified staff.  That is hardly enhancing the service - quite the opposite in fact.  All that was given in evidence way back when we discussed the matter at the joint committee and before the restructuring had actually commenced.  The joint committee was given examples from D&uacute;n Laoghaire where, even at that stage, volunteers were walking away from the service.  They felt they were not wanted and that their skills and talents were not appreciated.  MABS is busier than ever and its support is need more than ever.  The Minister need look no further than the data published on the number of phone calls made to the national helpline each year.  The number of calls has increased year on year from 4,556 calls in 2014 to 7,155 in the first quarter of 2019.<\/p> <p> MABS staff do incredible work in their communities, but they have been ignored by CIB and the Government.  When word of the restructuring of MABS was made known, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection decided to examine the rationale behind the changes.  We brought in witnesses and heard from all stakeholders involved, including CIB itself.  It must be noted that the CIB representatives were very reluctant witnesses.  After listening to everyone and engaging with them, the joint committee made a unanimous decision that the restructuring should be halted to allow proper consultation to take place.  This decision was ignored by CIB which bulldozed ahead against the wishes of the national management forum, MABS ND and the majority of local boards and staff.  The views of those on the ground actually delivering the service were also ignored.  If the Minister does not see fit to support the legislation this evening, I implore her to, at the very least, undertake to speak to the members of the MABS national management forum, former members of local MABS boards or MABS staff on the front line about the impact of this restructuring.  If she does nothing else, the Minister must at the very least listen to them.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is far too important to ignore issues raised as to what is happening to the service from the very people on the front line.

I point out to him that we do not have any volunteers in MABS.  The only volunteers we have are in the Citizens Information Board where they are very valuable and we appreciate greatly the work they do.  It is a real pity the Deputy started off in that vein.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 19 months ago, Deputy Brady introduced this Private Members' Bill on First Stage in the House.  While it is very short, the Bill has magnificently significant implications for the services provided by MABS nationally.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes simply deleting all references to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service from both the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 and the Comhairle Act 2000.  At a single stroke, this short section seeks to remove the statutory basis for MABS and replace it with a big fat nothing.  It falls so short of the required standard that it would, if implemented, create a dangerous vacuum for an excellent and a vital service that supports, as the Deputy rightly notes, thousands of our citizens.  The Government has no alternative but to oppose the Deputy's Bill which seeks to remove the Money Advice and Budgeting Service from under the statutory remit of the Citizens Information Board.  The Deputy has not put forward any alternative scenario for how MABS would operate after this change, how it would be funded, where responsibility would rest for the delivery of the service and whether there would be any legislative basis for MABS in the future.  The Private Members' Bill is silent in relation to all these important points.  If enacted, the Bill would remove the governance structure for MABS and create an accountability vacuum.  That said, I welcome the opportunity to talk about MABS.  Doing so allows me to emphasise the vital work the service delivers right across the State.  As the Minister responsible for MABS and on behalf of all citizens who receive and require its services, I thank MABS staff and their boards for the invaluable support, advice and guidance they offer people every day of the year.<\/p>  <p>  In 2008 in recognition of the need of the MABS network of 53 independent companies for a proper legislative basis and enhanced governance structure, the then Government, following detailed and careful consideration, assigned statutory responsibility for MABS to the Citizens Information Board.  It was the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition which very wisely did that.  Under the CIB's governance structure, MABS has continued to develop into a professional, well-respected provider of free, confidential and independent advice to help people overcome indebtedness and support them in managing their finances.  MABS services have evolved so that they are increasingly responsive to the needs of clients and its work has become more varied and complex over time.  MABS assists people in dealing with multiple debts and advises them on the voluntary and statutory options available to them.  Under CIB's guidance since 2009, MABS has been to the forefront in delivering a number of specific initiatives.  MABS has developed operational protocols with the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, or BPFI, and all major energy suppliers to put in place affordable repayment plans for clients.  Following the introduction of the Insolvency Act 2012, CIB worked closely with MABS to establish a new statutory service of approved intermediaries to process debt relief notices for people with low levels of debt.  More recently in 2015 and again under CIB's guidance, MABS established a dedicated mortgage arrears service as part of the Government's response to providing supports to those tens of thousands of mortgage holders who were in arrears at the time.  MABS has played a key role in the Abhaile service which helps people who are insolvent and in mortgage arrears.  MABS has a key function as it is the gateway for a person to access the most appropriate professional advice under its voucher scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the development of all these initiatives, the CIB has worked tirelessly and effectively with MABS to design new services, secure the necessary resources from Government and deliver them to clients.  MABS is fully funded and supported by the CIB which has consistently fought during my tenure as Minister and previously for an increase in annual resources for the service.  It is interesting to note that prior to moving under the CIB governance structure, the MABS annual allocation was &euro;14.5 million in 2007.  With CIB's support, this allocation has increased to almost &euro;21 million in 2019.  This represents an increase of &euro;6.5 million, or approximately 45%, over the period.  The increased allocation is evidence of the CIB's strong and ongoing commitment over a sustained period to the excellent service provided by MABS.  The scale of the increase in investment in MABS over an extended period, the creation of a legislative basis for MABS and the complementary nature of the services provided by MABS and the Citizens Information service are evidence that the transfer of responsibility from my Department to CIB has facilitated the growth and development of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  That is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  With Exchequer funding and national recognition comes increased accountability.  CIB is accountable for the funding provided to MABS.<\/p><p>To improve the governance arrangements and better direct valuable resources to front-line service delivery, the board of the CIB decided in February 2017 to restructure the governance arrangements of its locally delivered services.  This decision was made following detailed consultation and assessment, which commenced in 2014.  The previous structure, which involved 51 MABS companies and 42 citizens information service, CIS, companies, was restructured into an eight-region model, with each having a MABS company and a CIS company.  The rationale for the new regional companies was to improve the governance arrangements for CIB-funded services and to optimise the benefits from operating a more modern and streamlined service delivery model that focuses on citizens.  The proposed restructuring has been achieved through the co-operation of local MABS and CIS companies with the CIB.  Members of the UNITE trade union in MABS voted in favour of the transfer to the new regional company structure.  The restructuring process was completed in October 2018.  New service level agreements are in place for all the new companies, in line with best governance practice.  The CIB and the regional companies are working effectively together to further the MABS service.  The board remains committed to the establishment of local advisory committees.  It is working closely with the regional companies on the completion of their establishment.<\/p> <p> The Deputy originally proposed this Bill in 2017, which was prior to the commencement of the restructuring process.  It was proposed on the basis that the restructuring would have a negative impact on the services offered to citizens.  Despite what we heard more than 19 months ago, MABS has been fully protected under the restructuring process.  There have been no job losses and no service delivery centres have closed.  Most important, there has been no diminution in the services provided to MABS clients.  On the contrary, the restructuring process has yielded benefits to MABS companies.  Additional resources have been allocated to the eight new regional companies at an additional cost of approximately &euro;500,000 a year.  Further benefits for MABS and its clients are being realised.  The regional companies have more flexibility in allocating staff resources to areas of need.  Specialist skills are more easily shared across the new regions.  Administrative resources are being freed up from previous work associated with supporting 51 local companies.  This enables MABS to have a greater focus on the requirements of clients and ensures more MABS resources are directed at citizen-centred services rather than administrative overheads.<\/p> <p> Other efficiencies have also been achieved.  The number of payroll providers has been reduced to one.  A single insurance scheme is in place for all the new regional companies.  The standardisation of practices across the eight regional MABS companies is being achieved.  A greater proportion of resources is now focused on quality assurance and achieving improved outcomes for clients.  That is what we are all supposed to be here to bring about.  The new structure has not changed the values of MABS.  It continues to have a focus on clients.  Its commitment to empowering clients with debt problems and supporting them at vulnerable times in their lives is still at its core.  The decision to assign responsibility for MABS to the CIB was taken because MABS and the CIS, which was under the legislative remit of the board, complement each other.  Both services are involved in providing independent information, advice and advocacy services to the public.  That was the position then and it remains the position today.<\/p> <p> The Deputy's Bill proposes to remove MABS from the legislative remit of the CIB.  This ill-conceived proposal has not been fully considered.  The full implications of the enactment of this Bill have certainly not been thought through.  It needs a lot of wisdom to guess, but we can assume that the Deputy is proposing that MABS be removed from the remit of the CIB and transferred back under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This would have significant implications.  In essence, it would recreate the approach that was in existence in 2007.  It would overturn the decision made by this House in 2008 to align MABS with the CIB, thereby ignoring the concerns expressed about the governance of MABS and diluting the independent role of the service.  It genuinely would not have a statutory basis anymore.  If the Department is required to take over the functions carried out by the board in respect of MABS, it will have significant policy and legal implications, including but not limited to matters of contract law, procurement, the transfer of undertakings (protection of employment) regulations and administrative law.  It will call into question the continued existence of the eight new regional MABS companies and the benefits that are accruing from the new structure, such as enhanced front-line services, improved management and governance oversight.<\/p> <p> I stress that if this legislation is enacted and responsibility for MABS is transferred back to the Department, it will have significant cost implications for the Exchequer.  In such circumstances, the Department would have no alternative but to replicate and probably duplicate the MABS governance structure that was in place in the Department prior to 2008.  Substantial additional resources would be required to oversee properly the governance of MABS, given the significant development in the services offered by the service since then.  The Department would have to make a further significant investment in the development of ICT systems that create an interface and reporting structure between it and each of the MABS companies.  This would be a significant investment and would replicate similar ICT projects that the Department has implemented in respect of other services, such as community employment and the local employment services.<\/p> <p> I do not have a glass ball, but I hope I understand correctly the aims of the Deputy's Bill.  In light of the costs associated with it, as I have outlined, I ask the House to note that in accordance with Standing Orders 178 and 179, I have asked for a money message to be issued in respect of this Bill.  The Bill dates from a time the restructuring of the CIS and MABS had not commenced.  At that time, I could probably have accepted that the Deputy had concerns.  Nineteen months on, we know the restructuring process has worked well.  Despite assertions to the contrary, there has been no diminution of MABS or CIS services, no job losses, no reduction in opening hours and no weakening of MABS's responsibilities for local issues.   I, therefore, ask Deputies from all sides of the House to give careful consideration to this Bill and, in particular, the implications it will have if it is passed.  If they consider it as I have asked, I hope they will realise that it should not be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700043#UU00900","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561652100,"counter":522,"content":"<p>The Bill before the House sets out to remove MABS from the remit of the CIB and return it to the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Deputy Brady was correct when he said that the Bill was initiated in December 2017.  We probably need to examine the lottery system that applies to Bills to ensure they come before the House in a timely fashion.  Having said that, we must deal with the Bill that is in front of us.  We must admit that it is somewhat out of date, given that the restructuring of MABS has been completed.  While there are flaws in the Bill for that reason, Deputies will have an opportunity to propose amendments on Committee Stage.  We will, therefore, support the Bill on Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with the Minister insofar as I think it is too early to say what the impact of the restructuring process has been.  We will support this Bill to signify that we continue to be opposed to the manner in which the restructuring process was undertaken, to highlight the Government's blatant disregard for those who expressed reservations about this process and to reflect the majority view of this House when it called for the process to be halted.  There was a great deal of debate about this project.  It was a futile effort because it was going to be railroaded through at all costs.  The Minister has said that this process has been successful, but employees of MABS and others who are involved with MABS jumping up and down and talking about its success.  That is simply not happening.<\/p>  <p>  When my party colleague, Deputy O'Dea, brought a motion to the House in March 2017 regarding the restructuring of MABS, he called on the Minister of the day to halt the restructuring process.  I mention this to indicate that the changes that were made were not introduced without significant opposition.  Deputy O'Dea's motion was passed by a significant majority in the House.  As Deputy Brady mentioned, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection had an extensive range of interviews and meetings with people involved in the CIB, MABS and various other organisations.  With the exception of the representatives of the CIB, everyone to whom we spoke was opposed to the restructuring.  It is important for the Minister to note that the CIB and the members of the committee who were in favour of this approach failed to convince us of the rationale behind the restructuring process.  They failed in every regard when they tried to explain a real rationale to us.  They covered themselves by saying it was not about a cost saving.  I recall that well.  They knew that no cost saving would emerge.  They spoke about the complexity of managing 93 companies and the need to reduce that number to 16.  When it was suggested that they might save some money in the process, they said it was not a cost-saving exercise.<\/p><p> It is worth remembering that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, was an initiative developed by Brendan Roche in Cork in the Lough Credit Union in the late 1980s when he became aware of difficulties people had in meeting their debt, difficulties with illegal moneylenders and other related matters.  He established a small group of people and together they offered help and support to those who were affected by debt.  The project was successful and it was adopted on a pilot basis.  The 1992 budget provided IR&pound;250,000 - that was the scale of the figures back in those days - for the establishment of five MABS pilot projects around the country.  Since then the number of MABS has grown to 51.  Between 1992 and 2009 MABS was funded directly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and then there was a changeover when it came under the Citizens Information Board, CIB.  <\/p> <p> I mention that because the ethos of the organisation was to take a community-based, bottom-up approach.  The restructuring has turned that upside down.  That is the point the Citizens Information Board completely missed in all the discussions, namely, that the community-based, volunteer-led organisation that had been created in that form was being radically changed.  Those involved did not explain what they was doing but it transpired these individual companies would now act to do and deliver programmes without an input into the process; they would deliver Citizens Information Board-led programmes rather than responding to community-based needs which was their original remit.  That was a significant point.  <\/p> <p> Having sat at the committee and listened to witness after witness in terms of the whole restructuring process, and this was at different levels throughout the organisation, nobody explained and no rationale for given as to the benefits that would accrue.  By the time it was all over, I felt frustrated, annoyed and what really needed restructuring was the manner in which the Citizens Information Board did its business.  I thought it was an appalling process.<\/p> <p> By the way Minister, I did not receive the anonymous emails Deputy Brady received but during the restructuring process people were very concerned not only about their employment but that what they were doing was not valued or recognised.  Certainly across the Citizens Information Board services volunteers felt the work they had been doing for years was not recognised.  It caused much anger and upset in many communities.  <\/p> <p> I clearly understand that the Bill is flawed.  The Minister has clearly put on the record she will require a money message for it and she has set out the grounds for that.  She will use a blocking mechanism to stop this Bill from progressing.  That is what she is saying.  She and the Government have done that with respect to this issue every step of the way.  It was debated and the committee came to a conclusion but the Minister ignored it.  This House debated it and nowhere along the way was there an effort to accommodate the views of the majority of people in this House or the majority of people involved in providing the services.  The only people who were satisfied at the end of this process were the board of the CIB and the officials in her Department but that process missed what community organisations were about and there was a sense of loss and frustration among the volunteers. <\/p> <p> I know this Bill will not go any further and that the money message will kick in.  The Minister said the service is excellent but time will tell.  We believe the jury is still out on how it will function over the longer period.  We do not see the savings.  The Minister mentioned increased efficiencies and so forth.  Many of the efficiencies could have been introduced under the old structure.  We could have had one set of accountants, one set of auditors, doing the accounts of all  90 companies.  There were other ways to introduce those efficiencies but they were not significantly examined.  One model was kept in mind the whole way through the process and it was railroaded through.  It is pity we have come to the point where this Bill had to be introduced tonight to revisit an issue that has been spoken about in the House and in committee and on which no progress has been made because that model was railroaded through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700044#VV00200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561652700,"counter":524,"content":"<p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is a household name throughout the country since it was first founded in Cork more than 25 years ago in response to over-indebtedness and, in particular, to address the reliance by many less well off in our society on moneylenders, both legal and illegal.  It was founded on the basis of involving the voluntary and community sector in identifying local issues in their local area and putting in place local solutions.  Such was the success of the venture that the then Department of Social Welfare embraced the local voluntary concept, rolling out and funding the model throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  MABS flourished, grew and gained the respect of creditors, public utilities, financial institutions and the courts.  It was an honest broker which could be relied upon to present the raw details, as they were, of a customer&rsquo;s perilous financial state.  Arrangements were agreed with a certain amount of hand-holding leading to light at the end of that dark tunnel of over-indebtedness for people and their families.  The MABS objective was to be an honest broker giving independent, free, and confidential advice to those less well off in our society.  This attracted many vulnerable people to open up for the very first time and to share their every hidden secret to a MABS staff member, whom they now trusted, not only as a professional but as a friendly ally to lessen the burden they may have carried all alone for many years, fearful of sharing the stigma of debt with anyone else.  <\/p>  <p>  As the years passed the level of indebtedness of people and its complexity changed dramatically.  However, MABS did not divorce itself from the likes of the unpaid utility bills, the withdrawal of basic services, the unexpected family events or the local authority rent arrears but it also quickly recognised the need to upskill its staff in the new complexities such as mortgage debt, large unsecured debt, the loss of the family home, the recession, which still lingers in many parts of rural Ireland, debt relief notices, alternative repayment arrangements with financial institutions, debt write-downs and write-offs.  MABS is to the forefront in delivering on Abhaile, the national approach to mortgage debt.  MABS is the engine room which ensures that the arrangements are put in place, that clients in distress can get access to their vouchers for financial and professional advice, that there are constant communications and protocols developed with all the leading mortgage providers.  This all happens quietly under the radar delivering the results for us as legislators and for those in fear of losing their homes.<\/p>  <p>  For many years MABS operated under the umbrella of the then Department of Social Welfare, now Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  On many occasions, programmes for Government identified the need to have MABS established as a separate entity allowing it to continue its massive support to national Government and to society in a way that no other body has ever equalled.  Sadly, the ideals of various programmes for Government never resulted in the implementation of those promises.<\/p>  <p>  As a stopgap, in 2008 the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act transferred statutory responsibility for MABS to the Citizens Information Board.  This, in hindsight, was a mistake.  MABS and the Citizens Information Board are not happy bedfellows.  While the Citizens Information Board has much to offer in its area of expertise it has nothing to offer to MABS.  It is no secret that morale in MABS is at an all-time low.  MABS staff throughout the country feel that MABS is no longer the service that can pride itself in what it can achieve. <\/p>  <p>  A few years ago, the Taoiseach, and, indeed, the Minister who has left the Chamber, told this House that they could not, on the advice of the Attorney General, interfere with the Citizens Information Board&rsquo;s decision to demolish the most successful ever locally-based MABS in favour of a regional model.  This was another mistake.  <\/p>  <p>  More than &euro;2 million of taxpayers' money has already been spent on the project.  The results are there for everyone to see - longer waiting times, no training for staff, and no expertise in the Citizens Information Board to lead and support this vital service.  The Minister oversaw this in the face of a damning report by the Oireachtas committee and the wishes of this House, which showed the greatest support ever for a motion to halt the process.  I agree with Deputy Curran's comments on that process.  We now have the results.  What has been delivered against what was promised?  The answer to that is absolutely nothing other than despair and disaster.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight the Government has an opportunity to take back control before we lose the real benefits of what MABS has delivered over the years.  The Minister has already indicated that she will use whatever force she can in terms of stopping this, including a money message, but I point out it is the Ceann Comahirle who decides about money messages. <\/p><p>I advise the Government to allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage and get to a point before it is too late to open up the discussion on what has been achieved with the reorganisation of MABS.  It would also allow us an opportunity to listen again to the stakeholders who have indicated a lack of satisfaction with the outcomes.  It would allow us learn what has been achieved but also what has been lost.  We must call a halt to the reorganisation before it is too late.  We need to keep the best of MABS and we will be supporting the Bill on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700045#WW00200","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561653300,"counter":526,"content":"<p>While it is too early to say with certainty the impact that the restructuring process has had, it did not have widespread support.

Volunteers are important in every aspect of Irish life.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises and values the vital work that MABS and Citizens Information Services do.  During the recession many individuals and families relied on the help and support offered by these services.  They provided a vital lifeline for many of those who found themselves unemployed, in mortgage arrears and overwhelmed by debt.  MABS gave a great service to many families who felt they had nowhere to turn for advice and guidance.  It was the link many needed to prevent insanity coming into their lives and families.  I know that from people I brought to MABS over the years.  The half-hour of advice from MABS or being sent somewhere else for advice was important to those people.<\/p>  <p>  Our party spokesperson on social protection, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, brought forward a motion in March 2017 which passed in the D&aacute;il.  It received widespread cross-party support calling for the restructuring process to be halted.  Members of our party who sit on the social protection committee also welcomed the report from the committee which also called for the restructuring process to be halted for a while.  Fianna F&aacute;il raised this issue on several occasions on the floor of the D&aacute;il and by way of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Fianna F&aacute;il repeatedly called on the Minister to intervene in this issue and not to ignore the will of the D&aacute;il, as well as that of the many staff and volunteers involved.  Deputy Brendan Ryan put it well when he spoke about the trust factor where people were at ease when speaking to MABS volunteers.  That link was important to the many families who availed of these services.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il also called on the Minister to ensure any restructuring process did not result in the downgrading of the quality, effectiveness and accessibility of services to citizens.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises there is scope for greater efficiency and effectiveness.  We are not opposed to change and reform where necessary.  We are, nevertheless, concerned about the considerable disquiet surrounding the restructuring process.  It is vital that the concerns of those directly involved in the provision of services are taken on board.  Many volunteers have given freely of their time and energy to these services.  They now feel they are being pushed aside while their contribution is no longer valued or wanted.  We should never let that happen to volunteers in any sector.  As many of my colleagues know, this country would be in a different zone if it did not have volunteers.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has not shown much regard for those who expressed concerns about the restructuring process.  It is guilty of hollowing out the community and voluntary sector, often ignoring and downgrading the valuable experience and contribution of those who have given positively to their communities for many years.  That is why we are supporting this Bill.  We feel the restructuring has been rushed through and it was not an improvement.  I am concerned that the volunteers in question are no longer part of this process.  I regret the Minister used those two dreaded words &ldquo;money message&rdquo;.  It appears that many of us who support this Bill will not be listened to.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will take my concerns to the Minister.

Under CIB, MABS has continued to develop into a strong, professional, well-respected provider of free, confidential and independent advice, helping people from all sectors of our society to overcome their debt problems and support them in managing their finances.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the recently completed governance restructuring carried out by CIB, it is important to echo the Minister&rsquo;s earlier statement that there have been no job losses, no closure of service delivery centres and, importantly, no diminution in services provided to MABS clients.  One of the primary objectives of the CIB&rsquo;s strategy for the next three years is to consolidate and embed the changes resulting from this recent restructuring process, to deliver the benefits of these changes to the clients who need them.  It is important to allow for that time to show the benefits.<\/p>  <p>  These changes have led to a reduction in back-office administration, increasing the available resources for front-line services, which all Deputies will agree can only be positive for MABS clients.  CIB remains ideally positioned and legally empowered to support and promote two vital citizen-centric services, Citizen Information Services and MABS.  Both are charged with the delivery of information, advice and advocacy.  Both deliver to citizens at a local level, are entirely State funded and operate successfully under the single governance structure of CIB.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the MABS staff and their boards for the invaluable support, advice and guidance they continue to offer to people in their time of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700046#XX00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1561653300,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I could say I am surprised by the initial response from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection who is no longer in the Chamber.  However, I am not.  That type of stick one's head in the sand approach has been adopted from day one.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was in the Minister's position when this issue first arose.  He did not want to deal with it.  He did not want to engage with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection.  We brought a whole raft of witnesses in to the committee and produced a brilliant report which received cross-party support.  We sent that report to the Minister who failed to engage or to express any views on it.  He stuck his head in the sand and allowed the tearing apart of the MABS structures to proceed.  There was a debate on the issue in the D&aacute;il and a motion was passed.  It was the will of the House that the process be stopped.  That was also the main finding of the report.  This was all ignored.  <br\/><br\/>I am therefore not surprised that the Minister's Government, knowing that it will be defeated on this legislation, is again pulling the money message procedure out of its back pocket.  That does not surprise me but it does disappoint me because not only has the Minister not taken on board the views of the Members of this House and of the Oireachtas joint committee, she has not taken on the views of the people who matter, the people who have worked on the front line since MABS was set up in 1992.  She has not taken on board their concerns.  The evidence I have been given shows that there has been a reduction in the standard of service being provided to people.  People are experiencing lengthy delays when waiting to be seen.  One person who actually works within the service says that there has been a massive brain drain and that people have walked away.  This person says there has been:<\/p><blockquote>Loss of knowledge, talent and skills of qualified professional staff in the organisation.  As noted, many staff qualified as AMA&rsquo;s and Al&rsquo;s.  Others were solicitors, barristers, accountants, etc.  Many have since left the organisation either early retired or moved on to other organisations. <\/blockquote><p>This was a direct result of what has taken place.  There have been negative consequences to the restructuring process.  The Minister has said that the legislation is deeply flawed.  I find that insulting, although not to me personally because I did not draft it.  This legislation was drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers.  If the Minister is having a go at the people employed by the Houses to draft legislation, it is a serious error on her part.  I certainly do not believe this legislation is deeply flawed.  I am not precious about it.  If the Minister thinks there are flaws within the legislation I will happily accept constructive amendments on Committee Stage in order to strengthen the Bill and to put meat on the bones, so to speak.  I will absolutely do that.  The Minister should not, however, hide behind the nonsensical argument that this legislation is deeply flawed.<br\/><br\/>I spoke about the anonymous correspondence I received.  It would be worthwhile to put some of it on record as it shows what people who actually work within the service feel:<\/p><blockquote>Anonymity and Fear <br \/><br \/>Apologies for being anonymous but some colleagues who were previously very vocal about the absurdity of the restructure plan are being targeted.  There is a general feeling that we are NOT allowed to talk to media or anyone else about what has and is going on.  <br \/><br \/>What was \/ is the purpose of the restructure?Well not for the benefit of all stakeholders nor primarily the public (the old vision, mission, etc) which we are supposed to serve! <br \/><br \/>From the very first commissioned study (by contractors!) in 2014 it was very clear that not all stakeholders were being considered.  Over the last two years it is abundantly clear that the only stakeholders represented are CIB and the many expensive consultants contracted at regular intervals for lots of projects.  <br \/><br \/>No valid reasoning\/evidence was ever provided for the need to restructure.  Derogatory comments had been made such as &lsquo;there is a horrendous lack of governance...&rsquo;  One possible example being constantly repeated as such evidence.  But it made no sense because ...This was against a background of much increased governance and controls<\/blockquote><p>These are the words of a person on the front line regarding the impact this restructure is having.  These are the views I take on board and the views to which the Minister and her predecessor have not listened.  That is an absolute shame.  <br\/><br\/>In her opening comments the Minister unfortunately attacked me for quoting someone on the front line who talks about the toxic organisation that is the Citizens Information Board.  She tried to muddy the waters and to suggest that I was making a direct attack on everyone involved in the citizens' information services.  That is completely disingenuous of the Minister.  I know from dealing with people, as does everyone in this House, that the work done by the staff of the citizens' information services is phenomenal.  There is a distinct difference between the Citizens Information Board and the citizens' information services, which it funds.  A person who works on the front line categorises that board as a toxic environment.  To suggest that is an attack on all staff in the citzens' information services is absolutely pitiful.  To use that to try to take away from what this legislation seeks to do is very sad.<br\/><br\/>The Minister also says that this Bill is 19 months too late and that, had it come before her at that time, she would have looked at it or taken it on board.  Neither she nor the Government would have.  I have outlined all the reasons why.  The Minister who was in charge at that time would not even engage with the committee.  He outlined all the reasons he could not intervene and hid behind advice from the Attorney General, even though previous Ministers had intervened to stop the exact same thing happening in the past.  So many false arguments have been put forward and that is pitiful.  <br\/><br\/>My sole objective in all of this is ensuring that the phenomenal work carried out by MABS over many years is allowed to continue into the future.  The evidence shows that this restructuring has cost a fortune.  The Minister said in a reply to a parliamentary question of mine that it has only cost in the region of &euro;660,000.  The actual figure is closer to &euro;2 million.  As a result of this, not only have we seen the brain drain described by one worker on the front line, but a reduction in services.  That is my sole motivation in bringing forward this legislation.  I want to ensure that MABS is allowed to continue doing the phenomenal work it has done in the past.<br\/><br\/>The Government is going to be defeated on this.  There is cross-party support for this Bill.  Unfortunately the Government will again hide behind a money message.  That is no surprise.  There are now 55 Opposition Bills being held up by the money message procedure.  That is a disgrace.  If the Minister is serious about MABS, about protecting people, and about providing service to people who need it, she will allow this Bill to move on to Committee Stage.  We can then bring in expert witnesses, tease things out, and make amendments to strengthen the legislation to ensure that MABS can go forward on the strongest possible footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700046#XX00400","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561653900,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561653900,"counter":531,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 4 July 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700047#YY00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561653900,"counter":532,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 6.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 July 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
