I have been contacted by the parents of the children who attend Shraheen national school in Knockmore, County Mayo, and by Councillor Neil Cruise about the school's pupil numbers and teacher allocations.  The school has two teachers at present.  Just 14 pupils were enrolled in the school at the start of the school year in September.  In accordance with Department of Education and Skills criteria, an extra pupil needed to be enrolled in the school by the 30 September deadline so that it could retain its second teacher.  My understanding is that a 15th pupil was in attendance at the school last Friday, 28 September.  I understand that up to 11 children from families that are already in the parish and the catchment area will be enrolling in the school in the next couple of years.  This does not take account of any extra pupils who might come to the school from outside the area in that time.<\/p> <p>I will explain the dilemma that is being faced by everybody in the area.  If the school can stay open for this year, it is projected that its numbers will increase thereafter.  As the number of pupils in fifth and sixth class is small, just two pupils will leave in the next two or three years.  It is projected that something like 11 pupils will come into the school during that time.  I understand that the deadline which was given was not relayed to the parents until after the school opened for the new term in September.  This meant that the timeframe for getting an extra pupil enrolled was very tight.  I presume the returns from Shraheen national school are not in yet.  I am raising this matter because schools in local parishes and local areas are obviously very important for the people of those communities.  It is important for the high standard of teaching in this school to continue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John O'Mahony:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Minister of State for being here to deal with this matter and I accept that the Minister for Education and Skills is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#A00600","speaker":"1426","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of Minister who cannot be here and thank the Senator for raising this matter, as it gives me the opportunity to outline the position regarding staffing in primary schools generally and in Shraheen national school, Foxford, County Mayo, in particular.<\/p> <p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts are published annually on the Department of Education and Skills website.  The key factors for determining the staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements for the 2018-19 school year are set out in circular 0010\/2018 which is available on the Department's website.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  <\/p> <p>Budget 2018 provided for a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule, which reduced the general average pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, to 26:1.  The improved staffing schedule has been implemented for the 2018-19 school year.  This measure brings the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  While budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools, that is, schools with up to four-classroom teachers, improvements to the staffing of these schools have been made in the past number of years.  Improved retention thresholds for the second, third and fourth classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for two teacher schools situated 8 km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and, or language of instruction were introduced for the 2015-16 school year.<\/p> <p>Budget 2016 announced a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule with this improvement implemented in the 2016-17 school year.  Budget 2017 announced two adjustments for one teacher schools.  Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  Regarding single teacher schools generally, those with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across six or more class groups.  The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  <\/p> <p>Shraheen national school is currently a two-teacher school.  The enrolment required to retain a second teacher is 17 pupils.  On 30 September 2017, the school had an enrolment of 15 pupils and was due to have its teaching staff reduced to one in this current September.  The school submitted an appeal to the March meeting of the primary staffing appeals board.  In its appeal, the school projected an enrolment of 16 pupils across six class groupings and the school was successful in its appeal.  The school was advised that the retention of the second teacher was dependent on the school achieving an enrolment of at least 15 pupils across six class groupings on 30 September 2018.  The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.  <\/p> <p>The current enrolment in the school for the 2018-19 school year has been confirmed as 14.  As the school has not achieved the required enrolment, the second teaching post will be suppressed with effect from Friday, 26 October and the most junior teacher in the school will be redeployed.  I thank the Senator again for the opportunity to outline this process to the House.  I have taken some notes on what he said regarding the fact that since last Friday,15 pupils have been enrolled in the school.  I will bring that to the attention of the Minister.  However, as outlined in the reply, the situation may well be out of his hands.  That said, I will bring it to his attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#B00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for State for the reply.

Efforts were made and there were 15 pupils in attendance last Friday.  I am not sure of the exact details but the numbers will have to be confirmed one way or the other.<\/p> <p>If the school's staffing allocation is reduced to one teacher, does that mean that the school will have to close?

I want to raise the inaction of the Department of Education and Skills <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>unregulated seclusion and restraint of children with disabilities.  With the greatest respect to her, I am disappointed that none of the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs considers this issue important enough to merit their attendance in person to discuss it.<\/p><p>Inclusion Ireland published a discussion document last week, &quot;Shining a light on seclusion and restraint in schools in Ireland&quot;, which shares stories of 14 children with a disability, some as young as five years of age.  Following the publication of the document, Departments should have been reeling in an effort to react to the issues that it raises.  Inclusion Ireland is concerned that despite being asked by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on three occasions, the Department of Education and Skills has failed to provide best practice guidelines or to introduce reporting and monitoring protocols.  Mr. Paddy Connolly, chief executive officer, CEO, of Inclusion Ireland, has stated that the rights and welfare of children should be at the centre of all that happens in schools.  On the issue of managing the use of seclusion and restraint, best practice includes support and training for staff, whole-of-school positive behaviour strategies, school leadership and external inputs such as child mental health or disability services.  <\/p><p>I wish to put the Minister of State on notice that my colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane, will introduce legislation on this matter, to which the Government will have to respond.  I will now read into the record some of the cases that were outlined in the discussion document.  The names have been changed to protect the identity of the children involved.  <\/p><blockquote>One day I went to collect Brian* from his special school and he was sitting on the sofa in reception crying.  His arms were very sore and staff would not tell me what happened.  Later Brian calmed down and could tell me two Special Needs Assistants had held him face down on the floor by his arms which were now black and blue.<br \/><br \/>Michael*, who was 10 years old at the time, wasn&rsquo;t allowed in the classroom of his Dublin school for 3 months.  Instead Michael had to work in an empty room next door to the room where his class-mates were working.<br \/><br \/>My daughter Jenny* was restrained in a &lsquo;prone restraint&rsquo; which is being held in a face down position by 2 or three people.  On one month this took place up to 50 times and this went on for some time.<br \/><br \/>William* was restrained in his school transport by the escort with his head held down physically for the whole journey which took 20 minutes.  William said he found it very hard to breathe and it was a painful experience.  On other occasions William&rsquo;s hands were held down &lsquo;just in case&rsquo;.<br \/><br \/>Se&aacute;n* was restrained by a teacher when he was in senior infants.  The teacher in question told me that I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s behaviour in school as he had found a way to restrain him.<br \/><br \/>Luke* attended a special school and he told me that his teacher had locked him into a toilet.  The school denied this when I complained.  We moved him to another school and a number of months later I was contacted by Tusla as two more children had alleged the teacher had locked them into a toilet.  An investigation followed but found that the teacher posed no risk to children and the teacher returned to the school.<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Killian* was locked into a small storage room with a small window.  We were initially told the room would only ever be used as a &lsquo;last resort&rsquo;.  The teacher put Killian into this locked room, unattended for up to four or five hours for trivial reasons such as not doing school work quick enough or talking in class.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are testimonies from the parents of children with disabilities who are some of the most vulnerable children in our educational system.

I do not know about the other Ministers in question.  I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I understand the impact it has on him as a former teacher.  I wish to advise him that the well-being and safety of children should be at the centre of all policy and practices in school.  The board of management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the pupils in their schools.  Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom.  This may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen in some circumstances.  Schools have a duty of care to all their students and any action taken to manage behaviour must be proportionate.  Schools are not required to report such interventions to the Department.<\/p> <p>The educational welfare service of Tusla, which is now under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has developed guidelines for schools on codes of behaviour, which all schools are required by law to have in place.  The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring.  In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school.  All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.  There is a range of guidance, advice and support available to schools, including from their local National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologist and the NCSE's support service.  Training is also available for teachers and schools.<\/p> <p>The Department is working on the development of guidelines for schools on responding to crisis situations and complex student behavioural needs.  These guidelines will be informed by advice from the NCSE.  The Department will consult the education partners on them as well over the coming months.  It is anticipated that they will be finalised by the end of this school year.  The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purpose of discipline, it should be applied proportionately and it should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation.  The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period, including matters related to behaviour.  It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.<\/p> <p>Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school, they should report these concerns to the board of management of the school in the first instance.  Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to Tusla.  In 2017, the Department received one child protection complaint, which referred to concerns relating to seclusion, and this complaint was dealt with in accordance with departmental procedures, including referral to Tusla.  There were no child protection complaints received in respect of restraint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#C00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply but this sort of reply drives me round the twist.  The first paragraph of the reply is a classic case of the Department saying it is somebody else's problem: \"The board of management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the pupils in their schools...Schools are not required to report such interventions to the Department.\"  It is not, therefore, up to the Department.  Mr. Paddy Connolly, CEO of Inclusion Ireland, stated that the NCSE has asked the Department on three occasions to provide best practice guidelines.  That has not happened but, according to this reply, it will respond to the NCSE by June 2019.<\/p> <p>I accept this is not the Minister of State's area of responsibility but I want her to impress on the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who are responsible, that there is no sense of urgency in this reply.  I get the impression from this that everything is fine and tickety-boo, there are ways for people to complain, the Department received only one complaint, and so on.  There is nothing in the reply that makes me feel that the people who wrote it have read what I have read into the record today in respect of children being locked in toilets, having their faces held down on bus transport or in classrooms, or being isolated in small rooms.  Nobody is suggesting that this is an easy job but a report such as this should have made Departments react in a different way from this classic response of, \"It is not really our responsibility, it is somebody else's responsibility.  We are looking at it and will come back to you in due course\".  If anybody in this House was told that a child of theirs had been locked in the toilet or gone through any of the events raised in this report, I am sure there would be hell to pay but I do not get a sense from this reply that the Department has that feeling.  I reiterate that if this was taken seriously, there would be a Minister with responsibility for the area.  Will the Minister of State impress on those responsible the need to do something a little more urgent and impressive to give us the sense that they are taking this matter seriously?  If I was the mother or father of one of these children with disabilities who have gone through these events and this response was produced, I would not be impressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#C00300","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I will relay all of the Senator's frustration and concerns and will outline the seriousness of some of the cases he has raised.

Nobody wants to go back to the days when young children, with or without a disability, were punished for different reasons, whether by restraint or being locked in rooms.  As a Member and as a parent and grandparent, it is not appropriate that any child should experience restraint in school.

Breda Allen, in the opening words of the 2002 SAVI report, stated that, \"This is a groundbreaking study, the importance of which cannot be overestimated.\"  These words have only grown truer in the past decade and a half, especially in light of recent developments in the #MeToo movement and the breaking of a powerful and shaming silence, allowing women to come forward and speak about the abuse of power and sexual harassment they have experienced.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware that figures released this week from the Rape Crisis Centre showed an increase of 10% in the reporting of sexual crimes in the past year.  However, even this increase is only part of the picture as we all know that huge numbers of sex crimes go unreported.  The need for another SAVI report to give us an accurate picture on the ground of the experiences of survivors of sexual violence in this country is very important and I hope the Minister is able to confirm a timeline and details of how this will happen today.<\/p><p>We keep sharing our stories, baring our souls, laying ourselves bare for all to see.  We risk questions and judgments and we hope that no one pokes away at the emotional scars our sexual assaults have left us with.  I carried a shame that was not mine for five years before I told anyone what happened to me and I waited another three years before I went to the Rape Crisis Centre.  I am not alone.  Do not let the laying bare of all we have endured be for nothing.<\/p><p>For the last two weeks since I shared what happened to me on RT&Eacute;, I have been inundated with hundreds of letters and mails from women and girls from every part of this island.  Some sat in their sitting rooms with their families and as I said those words, \"I was raped\" they found themselves saying the same, for the very first time, in the seconds after I spoke.  That is the power of sharing.  The Minister has the ability and the resources to take those experiences and transform them into action.<\/p><p>Some people may never be able to speak to another person about their experience of sexual assault, much less a garda.  However, just because people cannot report, does not mean they should be invisible.  We need a survey that goes into communities, that can reach survivors in their own surroundings and translate their experiences, their pain in sharing that part of themselves into a better understanding of the realities of sexual violence, the barriers to accessing law enforcement, medical and therapeutic services for those abused and their families and how the State can do better and respond to these needs.

It is extremely important to me and to the Government that policy is driven by accurate, up-to-date, reliable data.

Late last year, the Government decided that a scoping study should be undertaken to see just what the situation was regarding data available for the development of policy in this particularly sensitive area and to assess if there were gaps in the data available for policy formulation.  To this end, as the Senator may be aware, the Government agreed to establish a scoping group to consider the availability of data and make recommendations on a study to identify the prevalence of sexual abuse and violence in Ireland today, as well as emerging trends.

Presentations and submissions from key non-governmental organisations were made to the group at its first meeting and subsequent submissions from representative groups were also made and presented to the scoping group for their consideration.<\/p> <p>In line with the group&rsquo;s terms of reference and work plan, the group&rsquo;s academic members completed a paper on data points relevant to sexual violence.  During this work, other relevant international surveys were reviewed and cross-referenced to identify gaps in the original data points and address those gaps by adding new data points and variables not present in the SAVI study.  The group considered this paper and it ultimately became a core element of the group&rsquo;s report.  The group also considered survey methodology, ethical considerations, the feasibility of periodic data collection over time and data protection issues.  The group has since submitted its draft report to my office for consideration.<\/p> <p>This work is extremely complex and requires careful consideration of the sensitivities and practicalities involved.  A further piece of technical work is being completed by my Department to enable me to bring proposals to Cabinet.  I expect to be in a position to do this in a matter of weeks.  Once the report has been considered by Government it will be possible to be more specific about its recommendations.  I acknowledge the importance of this issue and I acknowledge what the Senator has said.  I am very keen to report progress on this matter over the course of the next couple of months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#D00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>My question relates to the scoping exercise, which is very important and which I welcome.

Much still needs to be done by way of a public consultation on sexual violence so that we can gather some of that data as they will not be accessible to us via academia or those on the scoping group.

Due to the complexities, undertaking a survey into the prevalence of sexual violence raises a lot of issues.  The scoping group has given preliminary consideration to the key issues and further intensive work is now under way to resolve a number of technical issues.  I am sure Senator Ruane will agree that it is important that any survey which is undertaken will take full account of the care due to individuals who will be answering questions of great sensitivity, as well as to those who actually conduct the survey.  It is also essential to have a sufficiently large number of respondents to any survey so that we will be able to draw statistically robust conclusions.<\/p> <p>Once the outstanding technical matters are resolved, I will bring proposals to Government and I expect to do so shortly.

The cost of doing this would not be huge.  It would be important to have such a system in place.  Dr. Gapert has received the support of coroners from around the country.  I am raising this issue on foot of a case in Dublin involving a person who was reported missing more than ten years ago.  A body was washed up on the coast of County Louth within three months of the person being reported missing, but it took nine years for two and two to be put together and for it to be realised that the body which washed up in County Louth was that of the person who had been reported missing ten years earlier.

It is distressing when the remains of deceased people are sometimes discovered on land or washed ashore on our coasts, as in the case mentioned by the Senator.  The relevant State authorities make every effort to identify such people by whatever means possible.  I am informed by coroners that fortunately there are very few cases in which remains cannot be identified within a foreseeable timeframe.  The discovery of skeletal remains or bones, usually as a result of construction activity, happens more frequently.<\/p> <p>The Senator is proposing that I should establish a new section for unidentified human remains as a means of centralising information and streamlining the identification process.  He has previously submitted to me a proposal from a well-respected forensic anthropologist that a forensic human remains identification specialist position should be established and located within the ambit of the Department.  It is proposed that such a specialist would centralise information and provide a service in respect of the identification of discovered bodies or parts of bodies.  It is argued that this could help to co-ordinate the expertise required and be of greater assistance to the families of missing people.  I have asked the various relevant divisions and agencies within my departmental remit to examine the proposal carefully.  This consideration is now under way.  The initial feedback I have received suggests that consideration must be given to whether the establishment of a separate section, with attendant costs or impacts on the work of other agencies concerned, represents the best use of available resources.  Statutory changes could also be required.<\/p> <p>I am informed that there is no evidence to suggest that there are major deficiencies in the handling and ultimate identification of human remains.  Most such remains are ultimately identified.  I would be happy to engage further with Senator Colm Burke on these issues.  I recognise that families and relations of people who go missing for long periods of time have their hopes raised when discoveries are reported.  We must ensure that all possible measures are taken to identify the deceased when remains are discovered.  I commend Senator Burke on his efforts to enhance the identification of unidentified remains.  He has done a great deal of work to advance proposals to allow families to manage the affairs of missing people.  His Private Members' Bill in that regard has passed all Stages in the Seanad and is awaiting Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I hope we can report progress on that issue in the coming weeks.  If the Bill is enacted, it will be of considerable assistance to the families of people who have gone missing.

Problems can arise when people who have been reported missing turn up in a totally different part of a country.  I know of a case involving a person whose remains were discovered in County Galway and who has not been identified, in which the evidence suggests that the person was not even from Ireland.  I am concerned that there is no central place where the Garda authorities and the coroners can go after bodies are discovered to cross-check information about people who have been reported missing.

Last week, I raised the issue of violent muggings and burglaries on the streets of Dublin.  We also learned last week of the horrendous rapes of three college students in Cork, of how they had not reported the incidents to their colleges or to the Garda and of the fact that two of them have dropped out of college as a result of trauma and personal violation.  In response, the Government agreed to set up a forum locally so that there could be a central focus by the Garda, the HEA and the presidents of the various colleges involved.  The recently published CSO report shows increases in nine of 14 categories of crime.  While recognising the work of the Garda in respect of gangland crime, in the sexual offences category there has been a 10.2% increase.  This means that approximately 3,000 sexual offences were committed between June 2017 and June of this year.  This frightening statistic cannot be ignored.  There were also increases in theft offences and a 10.7% increase in weapons and explosives offences.  All Senators have heard of increased anti-social behaviour and increased crime in rural and urban areas.  The CSO report confirms what we have been hearing.<\/p> <p>There is a commitment in the programme for Government to consider the introduction of mandatory sentencing for robbery in the home involving violence.  Is this mandatory sentencing ever going to be introduced?  There is also a commitment to resource the courts, particularly the Circuit Court, to deal with increased non-summary prosecutions of serious crimes.  Will this happen?  I ask the Deputy Leader to provide an update on these commitments.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to convey my sympathies, and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, to the family of a woman who died in tragic circumstances on Tuesday when she was run over by a lorry on a residential street in Inchicore.

These organisations provide general information and they also assist people in dealing with serious personal difficulties and tragedies.  The support they offer to Irish communities goes mainly unrecorded but their work is invaluable.  In the United States, the Irish support organisations offer a variety of services ranging from crisis intervention and management, supportive counselling with solution-focused orientation, information, advocacy, accompaniment to court - when required - and inter-agency liaison.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This year, in the Boston area, the Irish Pastoral Centre provided advice and support to at least 15 prisoners.  The figures on undocumented Irish in detention for deportation nationwide are relatively low year on year but the level of support being given is placing great strain on the limited resources.  Due to policy changes in US immigration, the toxic atmosphere is causing severe stress, particularly among the undocumented community.  This has resulted in an increased demand for counselling services due to increased anxiety, a siege mentality and insular lifestyles.<\/p><p>This summer, an example of the assistance given by Irish organisations was highlighted by a serious case that came through my office.  It was of a young person who was travelling throughout in the US and had not made any contact with home for months, and the family were desperately worried.  When the person was found, his mental health was in a fragile state and he needed urgent assistance.  I contacted the local Irish Community Services, a not-for-profit immigration organisation, and it made contact immediately with the place where this person was staying.  Through sensitive and gentle discussion, he allowed them access.  He was in a bad state, both physically and mentally, and was brought immediately to a hospital where he received the urgent medical care required.  A few days later, he was able to return to his family in Ireland accompanied by his brother.  Only for the professional and sensitive approach from members of our Irish support organisation, this could have had a different and tragic outcome.  This type of assistance is replicated in communities throughout the US and elsewhere across the world.<\/p><p>The Government, through its embassies and consulates, provides significant support to Irish support agencies and organisations and we thank them sincerely for their excellent work.  The recent increase of crisis cases has reinforced the importance of having an interconnected web of agencies, providing holistic support to the global Irish community.<\/p><p>The Government must do more, through exploring how these non-profit organisations can be further financially supported and I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure the Department continues to fund them to ensure they can continue to provide the excellent assistance they do.

That should not be surprising to us because, in 2003, Ms Foster left her own party because of her opposition to the Good Friday Agreement.  Her party supports Brexit.  It is important that Ms Foster understands, as she does not seem to understand, that this is an international treaty between this State and Britain and it is lodged under the United Nations.  She needs to get to grips with that.  As co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government and the British Government need to make sure that is upheld as well.<\/p> <p>Members of this and the other House have asked why we do not just set up the institutions in the North and have commented that there are no preconditions.  However, it is a precondition of any government to treat all of its citizens equally and it is not right for people here to advocate the setting up the institutions where there are not LGBT rights and where there are not rights for everybody in society.  For example, people have had to wait decades just for the truth through legacy inquests.  While we desperately want the institutions to be up and running, we could certainly never advocate the setting up of the institutions under such an arrangement.  Perhaps all of this gives people down here a better insight into exactly what we have to deal with in the North.<\/p> <p>Today, I commend the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget to the House.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, and others who have worked so hard on this.  This is an alternative budget and it is about lifting the burden from the ordinary people of the cost-of-living crisis and investing in their full potential and in the public services they deserve.  It has been fully costed and it takes into account the cost of living.  The cost-of-living crisis, we must remember, exists because of Government policies and priorities.<\/p> <p>We have presented this budget.  We have shown how, through increased investment in education, housing, health, and agriculture and support for enterprise and development and job creation, we can have a different type of society.  The additional revenue raised by closing tax loopholes, increasing betting tax and introducing an income levy on those earning in excess of &euro;140,000, among other measures, could be used to open hospital beds.  Contrary to some of the nonsensical statements that are made by Members who desperately need to appease their vested interests and those who control their thinking and the actions of those in power, 99% of workers will pay no additional tax under a Sinn F&eacute;in budget or a Sinn F&eacute;in Government.  That is a fact.  I accept 1% of the wealthiest in our country are asked to pay a little more but does anybody think that those earning &euro;140,000 a year should be entitled to tax credit?  Does anybody think that banks, which made &euro;2.6 billion last year, should continue to be given a tax holiday?  If Members think that, this is not the place for them.

The housing system is not experiencing a temporary blip or market correction, as stated by housing experts in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>last week.

There is a housing protest and a protest from the agricultural community regarding beef prices.  The beef forum met today at 10.30 a.m.  It is important that the House acknowledge there is a significant issue with the beef industry.  The meeting of the beef forum today is an important one that will be attended by the processors, some farming organisations and the Department to work out what is happening in the beef industry.  I attended a meeting in Skibbereen last Monday week that was attended by approximately 400 beef farmers.  One could feel the disquiet, to say the least, among the community about where the beef industry, particularly the suckler industry, is going.  This morning's meeting is very important.  I realise that there is pressure on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department to try to ensure that appropriate prices are paid at the factory gate for the beef product.  This will be the significant challenge.  The beef processors' control over the industry is the biggest issue.  How we formulate a plan to ensure that the farmers get an appropriate price for their product when they go to slaughter is very significant.  The Minister needs to engage with the processors to ensure this happens.  <\/p> <p>I am sure this will be a winter of discontent in the beef industry.  From talking to the farmers, I understand that the prices at marts and in the factories have collapsed even though prices in the UK have gone up.  I can tell the House the actual price it costs to take an animal all the way to the factory but after that it goes into a black hole and we do not know where the costings go until the product actually ends up in retailers' fridges.  These are important issues.  I propose that we schedule time for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House to discuss the beef industry.  Time needs to be allotted to the beef industry.  We need a real debate on it and to identify solutions.  More important we need to see what legislation needs to be changed to ensure farmers get what is appropriate at the farm gate.  What we really need is a labelling system.  We need to ensure that everyone knows exactly how much the farmer gets paid on the label.  The knock-on effect will be that we find out the margins the retailers and factories get so we know who is getting what out of every side of beef.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#J00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>As I stand here, we have a team competing at the IGBA Handa World Blind Golf championship in Rome.  I wish the team well.  <\/p> <p>I raise the matter of the the leaving certificate - words that fill most of us with fear and dread, even the teachers in this room.  We have an extraordinary education system.  Some of the brightest minds in the world are born, study, invent and shine here but something is very wrong in our education system when those bright minds are being dulled by an unfair system.  The State Examinations Commission was defeated in court this week over its role in the incorrect totting up of leaving certificate marks for a Wexford student.  That was a win for that student but at what cost?  Not only did she have to fight in court, the case could be appealed if full written judgement issued next month gives the State Examinations Commission cause.  Thankfully, the student took her deserved place this week and will not suffer from having to play catch up but that is just one good news story.  Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys ruled that the current appeals process for leaving certificate students is not only highly unfair, it is not fit for purpose and causes untold stress to students.  I was contacted at one of my clinics by students from Carlow and Kilkenny with similar issues concerning a process that causes massive stress.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Education and Skills has said that he will look at speeding up the appeals process for leaving certificate examination students to ensure they do not lose out on potential college places but we need to have a good hard look at the process and also put pressure on the State Examinations Commission to get things right in the first place.  It is wrong that a student must go to court to get a college place in time - a place she earned.  The future of several hundred students is in the air because they know they need to ask the questions and need to know their results.  They could be doing a course they thought they had to do because their points were tallied incorrectly.  More students who knew their points were incorrectly tallied have been stuck waiting a year to take a college place that should have been rightfully theirs.  A year is an enormous amount of time in a young adult's life and while some choose that route, others do not come back from it.  There is a need for a radical overhaul of the leaving certificate because a year is too long.  We also need to make sure that we are not putting students under immense pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#J00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I return to the topic raised by Senator Ruane, namely, homelessness and the housing crisis that exists in this country.  It is about time that we realised a few basic facts.  First, there is no prospect of resolving the housing crisis unless the supply of social and affordable housing is increased.  Second, that supply will only increase if the Government takes direct action.  Third, the market will not solve this problem if left to itself in the short, medium or long term.  Fourth, the Government has had plenty of time to consider all of the underlying trends and issues such as market and land availability issues and has not done its duty by the people and addressed this issue properly.  It is very evident to anybody who travels around this city that the cranes are on the skylines.  Hotels are being built and great projects are in progress but social and affordable housing is not being built to any appreciable extent in Dublin.  It is impossible to believe that the Customs House as a Department of State, and I am not going to personalise this, can possibly have its hands on the levers of power or be resourcing local authorities adequately when pitiful results concerning the construction of social housing in particular are trickling in every year.  The former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government was appointed with responsibility for this and made some efforts to deal with the issue of rising rents, which is a symptom of the shortage.  He then became T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The current Minister has had a number of years to deal with this.  Every so often, we hear of initiatives which, to use the phrase thought up by the spin masters in Government Buildings, are game changers.  The first thing to say is that this is not a game.

We have a simple proposal in our alternative budget, which has been costed by the Department of Finance.  We could raise the pay of every worker in the child care sector to a living wage of &euro;11.90, which would immediately address the crisis in terms of turnover of staff and would give hope to the workers in the sector.  It would cost just &euro;15 million.  For years my union, SIPTU, has been campaigning for a sectoral employment order for child care workers and this is what we need to have.

I am on record from two and a half years ago when the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, spoke here, as saying his plan was doomed to fail before it started.  This was mainly because of the lack of specific numbers.  We had to tell each council to build a certain amount of social housing units because without a target they will not know what to do.  They muddled along and eventually got an inventory of the lands they held but the single biggest disconnect has been the building of social houses, which the Government has totally neglected.  Until it starts doing this we will go nowhere with this issue.  Talking about rent guides, rent caps and pressure zones is all a load of rubbish as the market will do what the market will do.  Social housing is where the problem started and social housing is where the problem will finish.<\/p> <p>With the budget on our doorstep we should look at the constructive use of co-operative organisations which have had great success in Britain, particularly on the outskirts of London in places such as Kent.

This means younger consultants are working alongside people registered before 2012 for significantly less remuneration.  On top of that, numerous locums are being brought in to fill vacancies or cover, and they are on significantly more money than these young consultants, notwithstanding the fact they are less qualified and not registered or qualified in the same fashion as the younger consultants.  These locums are brought in with any walk of life but it is pretty much an industry at this stage because of the number of vacancies across different disciplines for consultants.

It is using space that should be for physical education to educate in prefabs.  It is completely unacceptable.  Gaelscoil Buncrana and Col&aacute;iste Chine&aacute;l Eoghain are on community development sites and whereas people are very grateful to be able to use them, they are not appropriate for children's education.<\/p> <p>Many years ago - over a decade at this stage - the boards of management of those three schools came together and generously agreed to go for a three-school campus, meaning there would be one location for all three schools.  One would have thought it was a straightforward proposition.

Yet again, the same sites have been identified in the new process, and there have been negotiations on the site for years.  There is no deadline.

It indicates 51 disability centres were threatened with closure last year, of which three were shut and 18 showed sufficient improvement in care.  This report raises serious questions that need to be addressed by the Minister about the management of abuse allegations within the centres.  What is to happen with the 30 disability centres operating in spite of HIQA concerns about the standard of care for which no sufficient improvement has been reported?<\/p> <p>We must learn what are the procedures in place to ensure these centres come into line with HIQA guidelines in a prompt manner, and what happens if these centres are unable to show improvement?  How long are people with disabilities expected to stay in or use these centres if they are not in line with HIQA guidelines?  In the reports for each centre, dates of compliance are listed for each breach of regulation.  For centres highlighted by HIQA as having serious deficiencies, what period is allowed and how long do these centres have to operate in an inadequate fashion before they are finally shut?  Does HIQA have enough funding and resourcing to monitor all this?  We cannot just say that because this information has come out, it shows that things are being monitored and all is well.<\/p> <p>One report into a care facility in Dublin, the CASA breakhouse, recorded that eight of the nine action points from the previous visit were reissued to the centre with serious concerns over oversight arrangements.

To ensure Government and other documentation is accessible to as many people as is possible, plain English is desirable.  In the good old days when there was a decent President in the United States, former President Obama introduced a plain writing Act which has been of enormous benefit to people with literacy challenges in the United States.

He spoke of how the Minister of State had given a strong commitment to PDFORRA that the strength of the Defence Forces would not fall below the level of 9,500.  I am disappointed to say that this commitment has fallen 600 short such that the current strength of the Defence Forces is 8,900.  Members are walking away from the Defence Forces in droves.  This year, 173 of them paid a large amount of money to walk away from the Defence Forces.  In 2017, over 700 people left the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces are in crisis.  PDFORRA recognises this crisis and the wives and partners of Defence Forces members recognise it is a crisis but, unfortunately, the Minister of State and the Government refuse to accept it.  I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to come to the House for a discussion on this important issue.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, two reports on the North-South interconnector were published, one of which examined the technical feasibility of undergrounding the cables while the other examined compensation levels for those affected.  I am not surprised at the outcome as I have spoken in this House on several occasions about the credibility of these two reports.  As far as the three affected counties - Monaghan, Cavan and Meath - are concerned the credibility of EirGrid and the Department on this issue is in tatters.  I call on the four Ministers currently living within those three counties to listen to what the local people are saying.  As far as they are concerned, there will be no pylons built on their lands.  I plead with the Ministers concerned to listen to the people and to bring their views back to their Cabinet colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#M00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators who raised issues on the Order of Business.  Senator Ardagh raised the issue of crime and highlighted a number of worrying statistics, particularly in the area of sexual offences.  They are frightening statistics, as far as I am concerned.  I do not know when mandatory sentencing will be introduced but it is something in which I would be very interested.  I agree with Senator Ardagh that it is necessary.  The Senator also expressed sympathy to the family of a lady who was killed tragically in her constituency.  We all extend our sympathies to the family concerned.<\/p> <p>Senator Lawless raised the important issue of organisations that support the Irish diaspora abroad and he spoke very eloquently about the services that they provide to many vulnerable people and, in particular, the undocumented.  There is great uncertainty among the undocumented in the US under the Trump Administration, which is very worrying for individuals on a daily basis.  It is vital that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade increases the funding to those worthwhile organisations.  <\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh and others raised the issue of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are all at one in that regard.  As stated by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have been very strong on the issue.  Ms Arlene Foster, MLA, and her hard core DUP supporters are on a solo run.  Nobody on the island of Ireland supports what she said.  The Good Friday Agreement is internationally recognised as having been a success and it is not up for negotiation.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane raised the housing crisis.  Homelessness is one of the greatest challenges facing this Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It goes without saying that nobody wants to see people homeless.  That is why there is a massive social housing programme under way at the moment.  Under Project Ireland 2040 the Government is committed to providing 100,000 new social homes over the next decade.  Since 2016 more than 15,000 new social homes have been provided.  We are on track to have almost 8,000 new social homes provided this year, 9,500 in 2019, 11,000 in 2020 and more than 12,000 in 2021 and we are committed to keeping the level of new social home provision at 12,000 per annum thereafter.  This is a level of social housing provision that is unprecedented in recent decades.  It is obviously very much needed and something to which the Government is committed.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is working with local authorities to bring a number of additional hubs on stream in 2018, details of which will become available as projects are finalised by housing authorities.  Given the continuing numbers of families presenting to homeless services, as well as the continuing use of hotels, early in January the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government commenced a rapid hub programme that will see additional family places added to existing hubs.  Family hubs offer families living arrangements with a greater level of stability.  All of the indicators are now showing some improvement but obviously it is still a monumental challenge and one which the Government is committed to meeting.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Kevin Humphreys raised the related issue of regulating Airbnb.  It is my understanding that an announcement will be made in that regard in a number of weeks.  I was in touch with the Minister about that very issue yesterday and while he did not give me an exact timeframe, he said that there are variables relevant to the budget which he is trying to work out.  I would expect an announcement very soon but if I get anything more concrete on that, I will pass it on to Senator Humphreys who has been raising this issue consistently in the House.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Lombard raised the issue of beef prices and the beef forum that is taking place today.  He spoke of how much commercial enterprises control the food environment including in the fruit and vegetable and tillage sectors.  Food production in so many areas is very much commercially driven.  Labelling is important, not just from the perspective of knowing the source of food but also in terms of knowing who got what along the way.  That would be very helpful because some supermarkets drive down the prices so much that it is just not sustainable for producers to continue producing.<b><\/b><br\/><br\/>Senator Murnane O'Connor referred to the leaving certificate and the State Examinations Commission.  I was also shocked to see that the case involving a student from Wexford went as far as it did and that she had to go to the High Court.  It is simply not good enough.  Senator McDowell also raised the homelessness issue and the supply of social and affordable housing.  His point was highly appropriate and I have already addressed the issue in my response to Senator Ruane.  Senator McFadden raised the issue of young people in State care.  She spoke about those leaving State care at 18 being put out on the street, which is appalling.  It raises the question as to how we handle that type of situation and what guidance those young people are given as they approach their 18th birthday.  It would be worthwhile having a debate in the House on the matter with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  I will ask the Leader to arrange such a debate sooner rather than later.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Gavan raised the issue of childcare, on which I have done some work in recent years.  It is an issue that comes up all of the time because parents are finding it very difficult to afford childcare.  It is regrettable that on the last occasion there was an increase in the minimum wage, the cost was passed on to those who were procuring childcare services.  At the end of the day, childcare is one of the worst paid sectors and getting the balance right is difficult.  It is an area that has been neglected traditionally.  In fairness to Fine Gael, it was the first party in government to put in place a dedicated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Progress has been made in the area but I and many of my Fine Gael colleagues would agree that a lot more needs to be done.  Obviously there is a balance to be struck between the rights of workers and those who need childcare services.  I hope the Minister will be mindful of that when increasing childcare supports.  Hopefully there will be some positive announcements in that Department in the budget.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Feighan raised the issue of Brexit and P&aacute;irc na h&Eacute;ireann.  I agree with his comments on the latter.  It does seem like a very worthwhile organisation that is deserving of support.  It is very supportive of the Irish in the UK, in the same way as similar organisations are supportive of the Irish in the US, as outlined by Senator Lawless.  Senator Davitt raised a couple of issues, including homelessness which I have already covered.  On rural Ireland, it must be remembered that there is a Minister for Rural and Community Development which demonstrates the Government's commitment to rural Ireland.  If we manage to curb the trend towards urbanisation, we will be the first country in the world to do so but that is not to say that we should not be trying to ensure that rural areas are well supported.  The co-operative idea is a good one and if money is available in the budget for that, it should be supported.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Boyhan referred to Multiple Sclerosis, MS, Ireland and I congratulate him on organising an event in the AV room today.  I agree that &euro;600,000 does not seem to be a lot to continue that service and I hope that the current level of funding will be maintained in the upcoming budget.  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of pay equality for medical consultants, which is a huge issue.  She referred to the fact that some locum doctors are being paid more than consultants who qualified after a certain date.  It is a very hard pill to swallow for people who have so many choices internationally in terms of where they can work.  It is no wonder that we are finding it difficult to retain consultants, especially those at a certain qualification level.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of the three-school campus in Buncrana.  He gave a very articulate explanation of how that situation has evolved.  While I cannot comment on it, I will relay the Senator's concerns to the Minister when I meet him later at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting.  I am sure the Senator's concern is shared by the Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McHugh, who would also be keen to see the meeting referred to by the Senator taking place.  I will certainly relay Senator MacLochlainn's desire for the meeting to take place as soon as possible to the Minister.  It seems entirely reasonable that the Donegal Members of the Oireachtas would ask for such a meeting.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Swanick asked about the status of his Lifesaving Equipment Bill, which sounds like very good legislation.  I will find out when that Bill is due to come before the House and ask the Leader's office to respond to the Senator on that.  It is a difficult crime to understand and is probably mostly perpetrated by vandals who do not know any better.  Certainly, promoting a greater awareness of the harm caused by damage to lifesaving equipment would be a good idea, in tandem with legislation like that referred to by Senator Swanick.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the forthcoming blasphemy referendum.  It is important to say that if it was not being held with the presidential election, it would cost considerably more.  While it may not be a day to day problem in most people's lives, many people feel that it would be preferable for it not to be in the Constitution.  Elderly care is another issue which Senator Mullen raised in the context of the publication of a report on the matter.  It is an important issue and one which we should debate in the House.  Indeed, it is too serious an issue not to be discussed in more depth with the Minister in this House as soon as possible.  All of us abhor the findings of the report, much of which was so difficult to read.  Senator Mullen is right to raise it in this House and I will suggest to the Leader that we have a debate on it sooner rather than later.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway raised the plain English initiative.  Lawyers and many other professionals are guilty in this regard because they believe that if they express something in verbose language, they will sound like they know what they are talking about whereas there is a greater skill in being able to put across a complicated idea in simple language that people can understand.  In that sense, the initiative is worth highlighting.  Senator Conway also raised the issue of gazumping which I thought was illegal.  If not, clearly it should be and I suggest that the Senator consider drafting legislation on the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to the Good Friday Agreement and the Brexit negotiations.  We should have a debate on Brexit - possibly with a discussion on the Good Friday Agreement.  It would be timely.  It never seems as though we are going to be finished with or tired of discussing Brexit because it is just so important to us.  A further debate on the issue in the next few weeks would be a good idea.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher referred to the Defence Forces.  The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has described what is happening as a challenge, not a crisis.  Nevertheless, there are significant problems.  I think the Minister for Defence should come to the Seanad to discuss this issue.  Senator McFadden tabled a Commencement matter in respect of this issue last week and I know that, along with Senator Craughwell, she raises it consistently.  It is something we should discuss in the House in the near future.  It is an issue that will not go away and that clearly needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#M00400","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1538559000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters: Motion","time":1538559000,"counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#O00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposals that Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measures:(i) Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1206\/2001 of 28 May, 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters,<br \/><br \/>a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 6 July, 2018; and<br \/><br \/>(ii) Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No. 1393\/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents),<br \/><br \/>a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 21 June, 2018,be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in accordance with Standing Order 71(3)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 11 October, 2018, shall send a message to the Seanad in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 75, and Standing Order 77(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#O00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1538559000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mental Health (Renewal Orders) Bill 2018: [Seanad Bill amended by the D\u00e1il] Report and Final Stages","time":1538559000,"counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#O00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.

Amendment No. 1 is a consequential technical amendment to the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the change.  The NSSO currently uses the PPSN to provide human resources, pensions and payroll services to the Civil Service.  It relies on the same lawful basis that all organisations, public or private, use to provide these services to staff.  NSSO functions are currently being expanded to include the processing of financial transactions for the Civil Service, Departments and offices.  Many of the grant schemes the NSSO will be expected to carry out processing on will utilise the PPSN, where appropriate, where they involve applications, claims and payments.  To ensure the NSSO is able to fulfil this expanded remit and to use and process the PPSN where this is required, there is a need for the office to be made a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation 2005 Act.

While it has always been the intention that the legislation would not provide a general legal basis for the sharing of specific special category data, I acknowledge that the text of the Bill may not have been fully clear that this was the case.  Accordingly, I propose an amendment to provide for the insertion of a new section that explicitly states that the Bill may not be used for the sharing of special category data.  That was one of the points Senator Higgins raised.<\/p> <p>There are also a number of consequential technical amendments to remove various references to special category data that will be rendered redundant by the insertion of the new provision.  There are three exceptions to the prohibition on the processing of special category data in the Bill.  The first of these relates to the processing of data under Part 5 concerning public service information.  In some cases, it will be necessary to process special category data under these provisions, for example, to record if a public servant has retired on health grounds.  The second relates to the personal data access portal.  This is so that users of the portal will be able to see what, if any, special category data on them is held by public bodies.  That was a point a number of Senators and I raised the last night.  The third relates to Chapter 3 of Part 9 concerning the prescription of rules, procedures and standards for data management.  That is also an issue we had much conversation on in the previous debate.  Such best practice standards should also apply to special category data.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Higgins has tabled several amendments on the applicability of the Bill to special category data.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 82 propose that section 64 apply to special category data.  I wish to inform the Senator that section 64 is not concerned solely with data sharing.  Rather it is concerned with how all of the public service manages all of its data, including special category data.  We may have a need, for instance, to prescribe strong binding standards for the handling of sensitive data, such as health data.  If this amendment were accepted, this would not be possible.  This cannot be what the Senator intended and I ask her to withdraw these amendments as I cannot accept them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 would have the effect of making section 38 of the Data Protection Act 2018 apply to special category data.  Section 38 does not currently apply to special category data so this would have a significant effect on the Data Protection Act.  <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 are intended to exclude the application of specific sections of the Bill to special category data.  These amendments are unnecessary, since the amendment that I am proposing to section 5 provides that the Bill does not apply to special category data, excepting for Parts 5, 8 and 9, for the reasons I have outlined and, given there is no need to keep restating that the Bill does not apply to special category data, I ask the Senator to withdraw these amendments.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 proposes that processing of special category data shall be subject to section 38 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  I would like to inform the Senator that section 38 of the Data Protection Act relates only to the processing of \"personal data\" and does not provide a legal basis for processing special categories of personal data.  Where special categories of personal data are concerned, the relevant provision under the Data Protection Act is section 49(b), which provides that subject to suitable and specific measures being taken to safeguard the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing of special categories of personal data shall be lawful where the processing respects the essence of the right to data protection and is necessary and proportionate, another issue raised here the last time we debated this, for the performance of a function conferred on a person by or under an enactment or by the Constitution.  I appreciate that this is very technical but the debate the last night was technical.  I apologise for going on a bit.  This amendment could have the effect of amending the Data Protection Act to permit the processing of special category data under section 38.  This cannot be what the Senator intended when she made this amendment and I ask her to withdraw it. <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 proposed for section 6 relate to interactions with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  These amendments seek to clarify that any elements of the public service identity, PSI, data set that constitute special category data cannot be shared in accordance with this Act.  From the outset, we have been clear that the Bill does not provide a general basis for the sharing of special category data.  That is an important point.  We are reinforcing this with the proposed amendment to section 5, which I am adding on foot of the Senator&rsquo;s comments on Committee Stage.  This means that in the event that any part of the PSI included special category data, it would not be lawful to share that data under this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#Q01100","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Can the Acting Chairman clarify whether we are also speaking to amendments Nos. 16, 22, 24, 34 and 82 in this group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#R00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#R00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I acknowledge that there have been some significant steps forward on this, notably the provision in his amendment No. 2, which makes it clear that nothing in this Bill, except Parts 5 and 8 and Chapter 3 of Part 9 shall apply to special category personal data alleviates many of the amendments.  Many of my amendments were submitted prior to the Government amendments.  It is useful to see this.  Several of my amendments which sought to address case by case the dangers of an inadvertent inclusion of special categories of personal data will no longer be necessary.  That is very positive.<\/p> <p>I have concerns about Chapter 3, Part 9.  I addressed them here and that is why I propose that the Bill exclude special categories of personal data, not just from Parts 5 and 8 where I realise the case is strong in respect of pensions, in Part 5, and access to information on data breaches under Part 8.  I do have some concerns on Chapter 3, Part 9, but I seek to address them in a later amendment in a different way and have had some indication from officials that they may be interested in considering that in another way so I might not need to press it. <\/p> <p>My concerns were that because Chapter 3, Part 9, included several measures in respect of the grounds on which the Minister might be promoting data sharing, it would be important and probably inadvertent, if it were to suggest that the Minister is promoting data sharing in order to encourage data sharing, that it would not include special categories of personal information.  There is a separate issue because it is a tautological argument.  I am sure it will be addressed.  I will leave it for now.<\/p> <p>I recognise that amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 are perhaps not necessary in this case.  In terms of amendment No. 6 I want particularly to recognise this was one of my deepest concerns in respect of the special categories of personal information and it was the danger that there could be an exclusion from section 38 of the Data Protection Act which would affect special categories of personal information and, as the Minister of State mentioned, there are suitable and specific measures involved.  I am happy to withdraw that amendment.  <\/p> <p>I will press amendment No. 7 because it is important.  This is an ongoing debate between me and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, with whom I agree on several issues but we disagree on photographs and biometric data.  I would like the definition from the GDPR included in this Bill.  I am happy to leave amendment No. 9.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 16 is a Government amendment.  There would be no point in pressing amendment No. 22 because it seeks to replicate the measures in the Data Protection Act for clear procedures where public interest is invoked.  I realise that given the location of my amendment it is no longer applicable to this section and to the Bill because special categories of personal data are no longer covered under that section. <\/p> <p>I urge my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il who supported the insertion of this measure into the Data Protection Act to ensure there is a similar measure which states that the Minister when invoking public interest, needs to set out very clear reasons for that public interest, and that it is placed in the appropriate section when the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il.  <\/p> <p>My final amendment in this group is amendment No. 82 and is perhaps no longer necessary given the wide exclusion of special categories of personal data offered by the Minister.  I sincerely thank his officials for engaging with me on that.  It will narrow and clarify the function of this Bill in a constructive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#R00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I am accepting amendment No. 8 in the names of Senators Higgins and Ruane because it strengthens the language after the word \"identity\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Similarly with amendment No. 9, where the Senators have drawn attention to Article 9 of the GDPR, it strengthens the language and I am prepared to accept it.<\/p><p>To go back to some of the commentary on section 22, the main issue, which the Senators will appreciate, is we do not want in any way to compromise the independence of the data commissioner.

The intention of the amendment is to expand the grounds not to be considered appropriate for the sharing of somebody's personal information with a specified body.  Avoiding the financial and administrative burdens that would otherwise be imposed on a second public body or another person where the amount is to be collected is mentioned.  I recognise the Government has tabled its own amendment in this regard.  Legal concern has been expressed at the highest European courts about the invoking of financial and administrative ease as the grounds on which personal information may be shared between specified bodies.  The Government has tabled amendments with regard to avoiding a financial or administrative burden on the person.  I recognise significant progress has been made in this regard because the Government now recognises that a financial or administrative burden for a body is not an adequate legal basis on which to share information and has reframed it to deal with financial and administrative burdens on a person.  This is positive and I will support the Government's amendment in this regard.<\/p> <p>I intend to press amendment No. 20.  To make this meaningful, people need the option of being able to state they do not regard it as a financial or administrative burden to provide the information twice, and that it would be their preference to give each of the specified bodies the information separately rather than have them share it.<\/p> <p>We cannot have an assumption that the preference of people is that their data would be shared between bodies without their explicit consent.  They have to be asked.  I do not go so far as stating they should be asked, which is what I would like to have included.  I have tried to be reasonable and accommodate reasons of efficiency.  I am simply looking to insert an opt-out so people can state they have given information to a particular public body and would prefer other public bodies that wish to use the information to ask them directly rather than having the information shared.  It comes back to financial and administrative burdens.  Some people will say it is convenient and wonderful that their data is shared between many bodies, that they do not have to think about it and that they have to be asked for it only once, but others will state that for them it is not burdensome to decide in each instance to give their information directly to a number of different bodies for the reasons and purposes they set out and to have control of their data.  For some people it is more financially and administratively burdensome to trace retrospectively where their information has been exchanged.  Some people will make a point of trying to track it.<\/p> <p>I accept there is progress.  I recognise the default measure will be an assumption that people are happy to have their information shared but I ask for a mechanism, and perhaps it is something that may be considered in the D&aacute;il, to allow those probably quite few individuals who do not want their information shared without their knowledge to have the option to state they would prefer to engage directly with each body.  It is a very small point but it is important for the dignity and element of choice of the person.  This is with regard to amendment No. 20, which is the only amendment of particular concern to me in this grouping.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 35 makes the same point.  In amendments Nos. 20 and 37 I have given two approaches and it would be good if the Minister of State was able to indicate whether one of the approaches is more amenable to him.  In amendment No. 20, I suggest a person could give instruction that he or she does not regard collection of personal data directly by a public body as burdensome.  In amendment No. 37, I suggest a mechanism might be provided to allow a person to whom a service is about to be delivered to give instruction that he or she does not regard collection of personal data directly as a burden.  These are the two approaches and I am very happy to press only one.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister may have a suggestion as to how to address the issue but he will understand the point I am trying to get to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#S02000","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Government amendments Nos. 18 and 35 arise directly out of discussions we had with Senator Higgins on the previous occasion, and they clear up some of the issues.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 20, Senator Higgins referred to mechanisms that would be available to the individual.  There is a right to object enshrined in the GDPR process.  There is also a fairly protracted public consultation process that goes on well in advance of the agreements being set out.  In addition, the public can avail of the data protection complaints process.  One of the concerns - I have gone through this in detail with the officials in my Department and I know it would not be an intended consequence - relates to the fact that the genesis of the Bill is to allow for data sharing.  We do not want to have a situation where every single individual would have to be contacted in advance of the data being used. and I know that is not what the Senator intends either.<\/p> <p>All data sharing under the enactment of the legislation goes through a rigorous governance process which has been identified and which has been accepted by the House, which includes a public consultation inviting the public to make submissions on the proposed data sharing.  Also under GDPR, the right to object applies, giving data subjects the right to object to the processing of their individual data at any time.  A data subject may also lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commissioner if he or she feels that his or her personal data is being processed inappropriately.  The purpose is to remove the financial or administrative burden placed on them as a person.  This is a positive thing for citizens as I am sure the House will agree.  However, as I have outlined there is also ample measure in place for citizens to make an objection if they see fit.

This amendment is not simply about objecting to the processing of personal data because in many cases people do not object at all but they may object to an automatic mechanism being put in place as to how their data will be processed.  People may say they have absolutely no problem with a sports authority or another body having their data but may want them to ask them individually.  There is a letter in one of today's newspapers from a large number of ex-academics from Maynooth, Digital Rights Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Data Compliance Europe explicitly addressing the concerns about the automatic mechanism, the idea that one should not assume that people want to give their data once to the system and have it go on its journey forevermore.  A mechanism will have to be found, not to object to the data use because in many cases people do not want to object to the data, but to object to the mechanism deployed.  It may only involve a small number of people but the simplest way to address it is to put a measure in place for those involved.<\/p> <p>I accept that my wording and my approach to this might not be perfect.

Again the measure we are looking to tackle here has become more important because we now have the Social Welfare Consolidation Act included in the rubric and it is now explicitly implicated in this Bill.<\/p> <p>We have major questions around the public service card and legal concerns have been raised.  There is a report on this, which is not yet published but due to be published under a section 10 investigation by the Data Protection Commissioner.  There have been numerous stories during the summer since our last discussion, highlighting the very serious concerns, including potential legal concerns, on this matter.  On that basis, amendment No. 11 is very reasonable.  It simply proposes that while a public service card might be presented as a basis for conducting a transaction or accessing a service, it cannot be the sole or exclusive basis for so doing.  While there are still question marks over this mechanism and a serious concern that has not been addressed, it should not be the case that it is the only basis on which a service user can be identified.  One is effectively forcing people to comply because many of these services are vital.  We have seen very positive movement from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of the driver's licence because there was a situation whereby one could not access a driver's licence.  In some cases a person's employment would be precarious if they could not drive unless the individual was willing to agree to the exchange of data or joining the single customer view dataset.  This is again around the options for the individual.  It is particularly important at a time when we cannot robustly stand up and say the single customer view dataset is adequately and completely to the satisfaction of the Data Protection commissioner in terms of the legal basis for sharing how information is stored.  It may be the case that we get to that point, but at present we do not have that assurance.  That is the basis for this amendment, which is simply saying if one wants to access a bus or other service, one should not have to have a single customer view dataset card as the only acceptable identification.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> That causes a lot of distress for people.  These issues can be abstract but they can be deeply personal as well, as we know from the large number of people who were distressed at having to get a PSC as a condition to attend college or access child benefit.  This is particular to other bodies outside of the social protection system.  So much for amendment No. 11.  Amendment No. 17 effectively addresses the same issue.<\/p><p>I turn to amendments Nos. 38 to 41, inclusive,.  Amendment No. 38 provides that the Minister will \"have regard to whether provision is made for a person&rsquo;s right to verify their identify using an<\/p><p>alternative process\".  We have been told that the PSC is not an identity card.  Surely there must be another mechanism by which a person can prove their identity.  Amendment No. 39 is the Minister of States and I will respond when he has contributed.<\/p><p>Given the changes that he is making, I will not speak to amendments Nos. 40 and 41 yet.  Amendment No. 40 will no longer be necessary if the Minister's amendment is successful, as I am sure it will be.  I acknowledge that it represents progress, but it is not fully clear to me.  I find it hard to see what it means.  I was concerned about this Part of the Bill because it seems to suggest that in cases where information is stored in a base registry, the public body would be obliged to go to the registry to access the data and would not have other mechanisms or opportunities.  I recognise that there has been a change.  Perhaps the Minister of State can explain how this change addresses my concern, namely that there are instances in which the best practice is to gather information from a person.  I am particularly thinking of some of the social and other services that may involve particular vulnerabilities.  Sometimes the very act of asking for consent or information has an empowering and sociologically necessary function.  I am genuinely not sure about this.  I can see that the Government has changed it.  I am not exactly sure how it addressed my concerns, and I apologise that I need clarification on that. <\/p><p>Finally, amendment No. 41 still stands.  It is perhaps a little more bluntly worded.  It inserts the wording, \"other than where that information may be sought or collected on the basis of direct consent of the person or data subject\".  There might be times when someone should be personally asked for a name or address, for example, for inclusion in a Christmas list or a therapeutic project.  Whatever the reason might be, this allows for human engagement, which is one of the indicators of success for social work.  It is quite technical.  I apologise, but I am not clear on amendment No. 39. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#T01500","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The Senator has raised some of the points I wished to raise about amendments Nos. 11, 17 and 38.  The basic issue relates to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, to which the Senator has referred.  It is pre-existing law, whether we like it or not.  I cannot accept amendments that would be in direct conflict with provisions relating to the PSC set out in existing legislation.<\/p> <p>In regard to amendment No. 39, which amends altering section 42, I note that the third last line of the amendment is the most important in figuring out what it is about - \"the information so collected is collected for the purposes of enabling that public body to access information\".  The information is an enabler.  It is the first piece of data, accessed before the dataset is even compiled.  It was referred to earlier as the key rather than the lock itself.  It is the initiating piece of data, which allows the public body to collect the initiator, as opposed to the subsequent pieces of data that will be collected thereby.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins is correct about amendments Nos. 40 and 41.  If amendment No. 39 is accepted, amendments Nos. 40 and 41 will be nullified.  I appreciate the issues the Senator has raised about the PSC in the amendments.  In respect of section 6, the Senator is proposing to provide that the card, or the underlying public services identity data associated with the card, cannot be \"the sole or exclusive basis by which a person may confirm their identity in order to conduct a transaction or access a service\".  Similarly, the Senator proposes to amend section 12 to provide that the data may be shared \"as one non-mandatory means to verify the identity of a person\".<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 38 and 41 provide for the person receiving the service to decide for themselves what is an appropriate means of identification.  Current legislation clearly sets that out.  Service providers must put in place necessary and proportionate requirements for identity verification to ensure services are provided to the right person and to protect personal data.<\/p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that in light of the GDPR and the importance that Government places on the protection of personal data, it is more important than ever that we ensure the providers of public services are certain they are dealing with the correct people.  This is only fair, given that in many cases it is not only a question of dealing with the right person but also one of dealing with large sums of the State's money.  That is an important part of the security with which the State wants to be surrounded.  The State has invested significant money and resources in the PSC MyGovID and the underlying safe registration process and it continues to do so.  It is a result of the safe registration process that the card and MyGovID are the most robust and assured means of establishing a person's identity when he or she accesses a public service.  In this context, it is a matter for each service provider to decide the most appropriate means by which it verifies a person's identity.  That is why I referred to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, because in that case it is identified.  This should be necessary and proportionate to each service.  I know we will discuss the words \"necessary and proportionate\" later.  It is something the Senator referred to a lot.  One never knows; there might be further good news.  It is not appropriate to place a blanket restriction on how the PSC or public services identity data can be used to facilitate data protection.  On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendments and I ask for consideration to be given to their withdrawal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#U00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Does Senator Higgins have anything further to outline on the amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#U00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I refer to amendment No. 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#U00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>The Senator is entitled to contribute once more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#U00500","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I realise we have much to get through so I will not speak at length.

I have sought to spell out a number of these issues in amendments Nos. 12 and 28.  In light of the movement from the Government in this regard, I think I will withdraw amendment No. 28.  Amendment No. 12 might involve duplication.  I would like the definition of \"data-sharing\" that is set out in amendment No. 12 to be included in the Bill.

I do not think there is a point in belabouring it.

There are public authorities and public bodies under the Data Protection Acts and there will be another definition under this data-sharing legislation.  The effect of this will be that certain bodies which are authorities for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts will be public bodies for the purposes of this legislation.  I feel that the potential for confusion exists.  I appreciate that it might be difficult to unravel this one.  This amendment is noting that and putting a marker down.<\/p> <p>Amendment Nos. 14 and 15 are included in this grouping.  There is concern about the fact that the definition of \"public body\" in this Bill includes commercial or private companies that may be contracted to deliver public services or functions.  Amendment No. 14 attempts to ensure \"the Minister will make and publish regulations on suitable and specific\" measures to make sure it is not the case that commercial activities taking place within companies that have contracts for the delivery of public services, which will be considered to be public bodies under this Bill, are not suitably corrected.  Amendment No. 15 seeks to address situations in which bodies that are considered to be public bodies under this legislation may also have commercial interests.  It is the same concern.<\/p> <p>I will let the Minister of State speak on amendment No. 79 because it is a Government amendment.  I know he has looked at this key issue.

This matter will arise at a later stage of this debate when we talk about the data governance board.

To put it simply, there must be a definition in this Bill to facilitate the sharing of information between body A and body B.  That is why we have taken the approach we have taken.  Otherwise, we could get into an even more difficult situation.  If we were to provide for a loose definition of the bodies that are sharing information, organisations and public bodies that need to have data-sharing agreements might unintentionally fall outside the scope of it as an unintended consequence.  I do not think that is something anyone would want.<\/p> <p>The Senator is seeking to align the definition of a \"public body\" in this Bill with the definition that is already set out in the Data Protection Acts.  I understand the logic of the Senator's proposal and I do not disagree with it.  However, I cannot accept it because of the language that is used in her amendments and the way in which they are constructed.  The primary reason for the difference between the definition of \"public body\" in this Bill and the definition in the Data Protection Acts is the need for this Bill to specify a legal person or entity that can sign the data-sharing agreements.  No similar requirement applies in the case of the Data Protection Acts, which means that a different approach to the definition can be used.  The two definitions do not have to be identical.  The differences between them reflect the different requirements of both pieces of legislation.  The important point here is that we are talking about sharing between body A and body B.  In any event, the Data Protection Acts and the GDPR will continue to apply to all public bodies that come within the scope of this legislation and, therefore, will capture the issues to which Senator Higgins has referred.<\/p> <p>In addressing amendment No. 14, I should point out that amendment No. 79 came out of the discussions we had on Committee Stage.  I intimated at the time that I was prepared to come back and do something.  In that context, amendment No. 79 proposes to amend section 64 of the Bill to allow the Minister to issue rules, standards and procedures in respect of \"the processing of personal data by a public body designated in an order made under section 9(4)\".  I believe this will have the effect the Senator is seeking here.  I ask her to consider withdrawing her amendments on the basis of the context in which we had our previous discussions.  Amendment No. 15 would have the perhaps unintended effect of excluding public bodies from data sharing in the furtherance of any commercial activities in which they may be involved.  While I can see where the Senator is coming from with these amendments and I support the principle of what she is trying to achieve, there are a number of technical difficulties with the wording.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For instance, commercial interests are not defined.

My concern is that currently line 6 states that the formal requirement in a data-sharing agreement is simply that it must be in writing.  It certainly cannot exist in thought alone and, therefore, the requirement that it be in writing is good and clear but we need more than that.  I am sure it is probably the intention, but the data-sharing agreement should not only be written but also published.  The question then arises as to where it should be published, accessed and shareable.  The proposals I make in these amendments are that it could be published and made available to any Oireachtas committee on request.  For example, if a committee is dealing with local government and sport, a data-sharing agreement might be implied and the relevant committee should be able to access it.  If there was a data-sharing agreement between an educational body and another body, the relevant committee would be able to access it and it would be made available.<\/p> <p>I recognise that this will be pushed back.  My original proposal had been that an opinion on each data-sharing agreement should be sought from the DPC and published before the date of commencement of the agreement, and made available to Oireachtas committee on request.  I can anticipate the concerns there might be about that as I know the Government wishes to ensure the independence of the commissioner's role.  I am happy to review this but my intention is not that the commissioner would be consulted in advance of the data-sharing agreement, rather, that following the agreement between the public bodies, there should be an advance opportunity to give an opinion on it prior to its commencement.  It will make the life of the DPC's office easier if it does not have to respond following commencement, and mistakes could be avoided.  The commission will not be involved in the preparation of the data-sharing agreement but, following the conclusion of the agreement, it should be given the opportunity to express an opinion prior to commencement.  If issues arise, we would anticipate the problem rather than retrospectively seeking to address it.  My preferred version, therefore, is No. 25.  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 26 has the same intent.  It is a simple amendment relating to the publication of data-sharing agreements, but I am also happy if the Minister of State has another way to address that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#W03600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>During the early stages of the drafting of the Bill, officials in my Department had extensive engagement with the Data Protection Commission.

This is a standard provision given to most boards.  I would expect that the skill sets each member will bring to the board will be sufficient for it to carry out its functions internally most of the time.  However, I foresee circumstances where it would be appropriate for the board to seek external advice and assistance on specific matters.  We discussed this during a previous debate on the Bill.  This particularly arises where the board is developing data management rules, procedures and standards and may need to draw on specialised technical advice on certain matters.  Nobody would want a situation where we tie the hands of the board so it could not get external advice.<\/p> <p>I propose to accept amendment No. 58.<\/p> <p>With regard to amendment No. 59, I understand where the Senators are coming from but the phrase \"annual review and expiry\" would mean we could have a situation where consultancy advice required for more than one calendar year would have to be procured every year.

In this regard, I will not press the majority of my amendments.  There is only one area in which we will come to a slight conflict, which is with regard to amendments Nos. 63 and 64.  My concern is that the overall positive amendment No. 63 allows the Minister to appoint no fewer than two and no more than four people who are not employees or holders of an office or other position in a public body.  If the number of members of the board is increased in the future, the cap of no more than four people who are not employed by a public body could be an issue.  I agree with every other word of the amendment.  Amendment No. 64 also proposes no fewer than two members who are not employees of a public body but removes the cap of having four such people.  This is the only difference, otherwise the wording is identical.  I acknowledge the thought that has gone into these amendments on the part of the Minister of State.

There was confusion in the Bills Office that three amendments due to be made in this section, the third of which would also include lines 13 and 14.<\/p> <p>These are the grounds.  This is probably the final substantive concern that we have.  It relates to the fact that the purposes under which the Minister may prescribe rules and promises, procedures and standards relating to base registries, for example, and how information is recorded in public databases, include \"to promote increased sharing of information between public bodies in accordance with this Act\".  We could end up with a tautology whereby one could share data to share data so that there is a kind of self-fulfilling loop.  It could undermine much of the positive work that has been done on the rest of the Bill if we had a situation whereby promoting \"increased sharing\" became a value that we were pressing rather than the sharing of information being something that was necessary and proportionate given all the other excellent concerns that have been addressed in the Bill, which have made it more robust.  It may be an oversight in that section.<\/p> <p>I am conscious also that Chapter 3 of Part 9 reflects special categories of personal information.  As the Minister of State pointed out earlier, what is set out in that section on governance under Chapter 3 extends much wider than this Bill.  Effectively, it relates to much of what the Minister of the day might do in many areas.  In that regard, lines 13 and 14 are a serious concern.<\/p> <p>There are also concerns in respect of lines 15 and 16.  The language is broad in terms of ensuring \"a consistent approach to the management of information by public bodies so as to facilitate the exchange of information between them\".  Given that we have a number of other areas where performance of the functions, modernisation and appropriate management are addressed, I do not know what is added by that caveat.  There is a danger that we fall into that same trap of administrative concerns being the driver in this regard.<\/p> <p>I will probably press is the amendment providing for the removal of lines 13 to 16, inclusive, but my primary concern relates to lines 13 and 14.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would be very positive if the Minister of State could indicate that he will move on these issues.

I will deal with the first two as I am sure we will have a little argument to and fro, particularly as I have distinguished legal colleagues with me.  As I see it, the primary aim of the amendments is to enable people in an academic atmosphere - in a university, library or somewhere like that - to have access to copyrighted material outside the restrictions of natural copyright.  I very much welcome the fact that the Minister of State is taking charge of the Bill as I know he is open-minded.  I remember approximately 15 years ago there were alarms about the question of copyright and the length of copyright.  I spoke to the then Minister who was responsible for the matter and warned about the attempt by the European Union to standardise copyright.  I argued it would have a very significant effect on the studies of the works of Mr. James Joyce, for example.  The Minister took that on board but this was introduced as a statutory instrument from the European Union under a heading that did not immediately attract attention to the literary component.  As a result, it went through and we followed the example of the majority of countries in Europe, extending the length of time under which copyright subsisted from 50 years to 70 years, with pretty catastrophic consequences for Joyce scholarship.<\/p><p>The Bill would insert the following subsection:<\/p><blockquote>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of section 50(1), the brief and limited display of a copy of a work &mdash;(a) either&mdash;<blockquote>(i) in a prescribed library or prescribed archive or by the librarian or archivist of a prescribed library or prescribed archive, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) during the course of a public lecture given in a prescribed library or prescribed archive or given by the librarian or archivist of a prescribed library or prescribed archive,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>In a brief discussion with the Minister of State in the ante-room, he assured me the scope of the amendments was covered by the Bill.

I echo the words of Senator Norris about my Trinity colleague, Professor Eoin O'Dell.  I thank him for his engagement with so many of us on this Bill and on potential amendments to it.  Speaking on Second Stage, I pointed out some of the issues raised by Professor O'Dell which we are hoping to address in these amendments.  As Senator Norris has said, they have been proposed by a number of us - not only Senator Norris, myself and the other members of our technical group, Labour Senators Nash, Humphreys and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, but also by Senators Boyhan and Warfield.  In these amendments, and specifically in the group I am discussing now, amendment Nos. 1 and 3 to 5, inclusive, we are hoping to address the concerns I raised on Second Stage.  The concern was that the Bill was unbalanced without amendment because it seems to ignore the copyright review committee's main recommendations in its 2013 report, Modernising Copyright.  That committee was chaired by Professor O'Dell.<\/p> <p>The recommendations we are concerned about relate to users.  To put it simply, we want to ensure that the Bill provides for user rights to format, shift and to back up and to provide for a private copying levying scheme to compensate rights owners accordingly.  The difficulty, and Senator Norris expressed this eloquently, is that people may not realise they are carrying out activities that may amount to an infringement of copyright.  We must ensure those activities are protected by exceptions, that are permitted by EU law, in the Bill.  Exceptions to copyright allowed by EU directive include what I have mentioned - format shifting and backing up.  Format shifting means transferring music from one device to another, copying music from a compact disc, CD, to a phone to listen to it or copying a digital video disc, DVD, to a tablet.  <\/p> <p>These sorts of matters should be excepted where they are done for private purposes and are not damaging the underlying aims of copyright law.  We should make exceptions like this in our copyright legislation.  I understand the concern from Professor O'Dell.  I am no copyright expert nor do I purport to be but the concerns expressed are that the Bill does not take sufficient account of the recommendations in the report on making copies for private use, such as in the ways I have described - format shifting and making backups.  We have been told that the main argument in favour of such private copying exceptions is to reflect consumers' reasonable assumptions, basic expectations and widespread practices.  That is what the copyright review committee has said.  The EU directive permits national law to introduce limitations and exceptions to enable user rights.  That is Directive 2001\/29\/EC of the European Parliament on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.  <\/p> <p>The specific point is that private copying exceptions for format shifting and backing up, which would be permitted by the directive and were proposed by the committee, are not included in the Bill.  If they are and we have missed that, we would be delighted to hear it, as Senator Norris has said.  The Minister of State has mentioned that he thinks the concerns we have raised are addressed through this Bill.  We are being told that they are not and we are concerned to ensure that they are.  Otherwise, the concern is that the law would not be realistic.  It would be a law that would, effectively, be unenforceable, unenforced and widely ignored by consumers.  Private users and consumers, however, would incur liability if we do not provide for the sort of user rights we are describing.  That is the crux of the amendments we are proposing.  We do have longer explanations for the need for the amendments but, essentially, they are trying to ensure that the recommendations of the review committee on user rights are enshrined in this law.  I will come in at a later stage if debate arises.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#GG00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As I stated previously, it sets a bad precedent when the State uses a substantial amount of time and resources in compiling reports and then ignores the recommendations.  The Modernising Copyright report was widely welcomed by all the stakeholders who contributed to that process.  The omission of aspects that allow for private copying exceptions, such as format shifting and backing up as mentioned by previous Senators, are particularly disappointing.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 provide for fair usage in public lectures and educational establishments.  In those circumstances, the use of content is for the public good and format shifting or backing up should not be restricted when the content was legally obtained and done purely for educational purposes.  The protection we seek here is crucial for teaching and learning and it does not go past those confines.  I hope the Government will accept this and allow the use of content for the public good.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 replace \"means\" with \"includes\" in the definitions of fair dealing.

It is not required.  On amendment No. 1, section 18 relates solely to fair dealing in copyright works for libraries and archives.  It proceeds to outline the various exceptions applicable in that area.  The exception sought by the Senators is already provided for in the Bill in section 14, which amends section 57 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.

It is not proposed to accept the amendment because section 28 relates solely to fair dealing for performance for libraries and archives.  The exception for performance in education sought by the Senators is already provided in section 29 of the Bill through the inclusion of new sections 225B, 225C and 225D in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.

Section 28 of the Bill, which amends section 221 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, and section 37 of the Bill, which amends both sections 54 and 329(2) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  The proposed amendment would have the effect of broadening the scope of the exception on fair dealing with a copyright protected work that is provided for already in section 54 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, fair dealing with a copyright protected performance in section 221 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, and fair dealing with a copyright protected database in section 392(2) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.<\/p><p>During extensive legal drafting of the Bill, the Department consulted the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, and discussed at length the wording in the Bill to ensure that it is legally sound, including on that precise point.  The use of the word \"means\" in the three sections of the Copyright and Related Rights Act involved provides clarity as to the meaning of fair dealing and ensures that there are boundaries and limits around the use of copy protected works, performances and databases.  Changing the word from \"means\" to \"include\" would broaden the scope of these fair dealing exceptions and could result in an unintended consequence such as a reduced protection for the rightsholders, and could result in rightsholders, and we are told this legally, challenging the legality of this section of the Bill. <\/p><p>I know this matter is complicated.  If Senators would like further meetings to discuss the matter I would be delighted to oblige.  I have been given the legal advice that amendment No. 1 is covered.

The legislation is so specifically drafted.  I presume there is a reason for that but I just fail to see it and why it could not simply have been encompassed - the use of copying in public lectures by librarians and archivists.  I cannot understand why that provision could not have been encompassed in what seems to me the broader provision, which would the amended section 57 provided for in section 14 of this Bill.  It just struck me as odd and that is why we made that proposal in our amendment No. 1.  We did so because it clearly seemed to us that it would be much more likely to have these sort of public lectures given in educational institutions.  It seemed odd that the Government would have such a lengthy and specific exception provided for in section 69A, without referring to educational institutions.  I wonder what was the reason for doing so.  Again, like Senator Norris, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.

I have raised his issue many times in the House.  The legislation puts the onus on copyright deposit institutions to request each and every publication they wish to deposit.  This is well beyond the resource capacity of any of our national institutions, for example, the National Library of Ireland.  The inevitable result of this is that material will be lost.  While other states have facilities for capturing their web domains, for example, nobody is systematically capturing the <i>.ie<\/i>web domain.  I have been designing websites since I was 15, and the Minister and his colleagues in the Department will know all too well about the Wayback Machine.  It is a not-for-profit enterprise, like Wikipedia, which captures web pages.  We need to reflect on the law that provides for hard copies of books and apply it to the digital age, and we need to do it fast.  <\/p><p>The only logical solution is to allow the National Library of Ireland and other bodies to sweep the <i>.ie<\/i>domain at regular intervals and to capture the contents.  Libraries and museums have historically been the custodians for everything that is published.  They are custodians of our national cultural heritage, and they are the best places to collectively store that knowledge.  Such a process would have to be mindful of journalism or other work behind paywalls.  We could look at international best practice for that.  Some national libraries have every website available on-site; one would have to go into the national libraries to view the files or contents of the websites.  If we do not act we risk websites such as the campaign for civil marriage equality, the Together for Yes campaign or the pro-life campaign disappearing.  Most web pages disappear, on average, within 100 days, so the longer we wait the more we lose.  <\/p><p>The legislation proposes that the responsibility for depositing the material would be given to each publisher.  Notwithstanding the administrative burden and resource problems I mentioned, such an approach would leave the process open to non-compliance.  Mass non-compliance in the creation of a legal deposit simply defeats the purpose.  I am aware that the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, which was accepted in the D&aacute;il during Report Stage, establishes a feasibility study into the creation of a legal digital deposit to start 12 months after the enactment of this Bill.  However, the study may take one to two years to complete and a further one to two years to be brought forward as legislation, which is too long.  I have mentioned that the average life of an individual web page on any website is 100 days.  I have also mentioned the fact that we are lagging behind our European counterparts on this.  For these reasons, a feasibility study would only delay this matter further. <\/p><p>My interest in this comes from the cultural aspect.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht commissioned a consultation on establishing a legal digital deposit.  The support from Trinity College Dublin and the National Library of Ireland, among other libraries, was overwhelming; some 90% of the feedback the Department received was in support of the establishment of a digital deposit.  It was strongly recommended.  Has there been much engagement between the two Departments?  The consultation developed when the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, was the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  <\/p><p>The need for such an endeavour has been pointed out by the copyright deposit institutions, which strongly supported this proposal in the public consultation.  It was also mentioned in the modernising copyright report, published in October 2013, five years ago.  The consultation with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht was carried out in April 2017.  The time for examining feasibility has long passed.  It should have been done as soon as it was recommended.  The only way we can have certainty in respect of this issue is to provide for it in law through this Bill, and I respectfully encourage the Government to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#JJ00700","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I have a good deal of sympathy with the intentions behind this amendment.

I have listened to the rationale behind it.  I wish to ensure that the issue of capturing the web is not confused with a digital deposit system, particularly as they are two distinct matters.  As recommended by the copyright review committee, the Bill broadens the existing copyright deposit system to enable the copyright deposit institutions to accept published material in electronic format as well as, or instead of, physical copies.  This will allow copyright deposit institutions to collect non-print works in order to produce a shared archive of digital works, and facilitate the development of Ireland's national printed archive.  It will also allow for works no longer published in hardcopy format to be deposited and ensure the continued archiving of important documents, including many Government reports and documents which are no longer published in hardcopy as a matter of course.<\/p> <p>On the Senator Warfield's amendment, regarding the inclusion of a section to permit the deposit institution, board or authority to capture the web.

Providing for a full digital deposit system that would facilitate capturing the web is not simply a matter of changing copyright legislation.  It is a significant national project that requires multi-institutional collaboration, significant resources and Skillsnet for capturing and preserving Ireland's digital record, according to my advice.  I reiterate that this is a matter for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who has responsibility for policy in this area.  My Department and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht have actively worked together on that matter for some time and we will continue to do so until the robust regulatory framework is developed.  We will facilitate the necessary corresponding legislation amendments in due course.<\/p> <p>This work, however, is not yet sufficiently progressed for any technical amendments to copyright law.  As that is the final aspect of the project, now that all the necessary due diligence has been done, Government mechanisms have been established and funding has been agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it is not possible for amendments to copyright law to be progressed in isolation from Government approval for the project as a whole.  An initial amendment was tabled on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Quinlivan from the Senator's party, and it gave rise to a good debate.  Consequently, a new section 106 was inserted in the Bill on Report Stage.  This new section stipulates that a report be published within 12 months of the Bill being enacted.  This was accepted by all parties and was viewed as a pragmatic way to advance the project while allowing time for the necessary work to take place in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in co-operation with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The House can rest assured that both Departments are actively engaged in advancing the proposal, and the report will be prepared within 12 months, as specified in the Bill.<\/p> <p>I see the merits in the proposal and I agree that we need to be mindful of preserving our national memory.  It is important, however, that we do not put the cart before the horse and that we allow the requisite work be undertaken in order that the capturing of any information is done properly, with which I am sure everyone would agree, without undue burden on the public purse, while ensuring that there are mechanisms in place to properly protect and regulate personal information which people have put on the web.  I ask the House to allow this process to take place with both Departments, and the report will be prepared within 12 months, as specified in the Bill and as I have insisted.  Again, it is important that what we do we do correctly.  We are engaging with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who is responsible for policy in that area.  I urge the Senators to leave this as it is, as the Deputies have done.  Of course, I invite the Senators, if they wish, to meet any representatives from my Department or the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I would be delighted to facilitate such a meeting.  I am advised that it is the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, but we are working in collaboration to ensure everything is done precisely in order that whatever is done is done right.<\/p> <p>I urge the Senator not to press this amendment.  There is goodwill from both Departments to ensure any aspects the Senators might be worried about will be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#KK00600","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I was in the committee rooms before I came here.

The port, once central to the traffic of freight and passengers between Ireland and the UK, has had no commercial shipping since the withdrawal of the Stena Line in 2015.  Declining car and passenger numbers, combined with increasing fuel and operating costs, made the Stena route unsustainable.<\/p><p>However, I am optimistic about the future of DLHC.  As outlined in the national ports policy, published in 2013, the future of the harbour lies in marine leisure, maritime tourism, cultural amenity and urban redevelopment.  As a local amenity, it is best placed under the local authority, which is better positioned to achieve the maximum from the harbour.  I am delighted that it has committed to ensure, on transfer, \"that the harbour will continue to be recognised as a location of choice for marine and leisure activities as well as a destination of choice for visitors.\"<\/p><p>For a number of years, DLHC has faced a challenging operating environment as it transitioned from commercial shipping activities towards a different operating model focused on marine leisure and marine-related tourism.  The company has been restructuring its business to keep it on a sustainable financial footing in preparation for transfer.  Its income is now derived from rents, moorings and property. <\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, the transfer of DLHC to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is agreed Government policy.  The national ports policy recommended that five designated ports of regional significance, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow, transfer to more appropriate local authority-led governance structures.  These ports retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities.  However, the scale and nature of their port activities are not of a scale that warrant continued central government involvement.  The longer-term development of these ports is best placed within their regional and local communities to allow them to develop in a mutually beneficial manner.<\/p><p>The Harbours Act was signed into law on 25 December 2015.  It provides the necessary primary legislative framework to allow the transfers to take place.  Two ports have been transferred.  Wicklow Port transferred on 30 August 2016 to Wicklow County Council and Drogheda Port transferred on 2 October 2017 to Louth County Council.  The transfer process is complex and takes a number of years to complete.<\/p><p>The chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council undertook due diligence in preparation for transfer and presented her report to the council on 9 January 2017.  As the report raised a number of further issues for clarification, the chief executive engaged a financial consultant to carry out a risk assessment to enable the council to fully understand the implications of the two different models of transfer and the responsibility that will transfer in financial and other terms.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The two models outlined in legislation are: (1) transfer of shareholding keeping the limited company structure intact, or (2)\u00a0dissolution of the company and transfer directly under the local authority.  It may help if I explain how remedial works are usually funded in the ports sector.  National ports policy clearly states that the Exchequer does not provide funding for a port company.  Ports must operate on a commercial basis without recourse to State funding.  Ports fund their activities and capital infrastructure investment from their own resources.  This can be done in a number of ways, such as using reserves or profits, selling assets, borrowing or by attracting private investment into ports. <\/p><p>In respect of funding remedial works, it is normal procedure in port companies to prioritise engineering and remedial works and to phase those works and the funding to undertake those works over a period of time, immediate, medium and long-term.  The port has a substantial asset as well as seven digit cash reserves, both of which transferred to the council and will allow for any urgent and immediate infrastructural works to be carried out.  However, how the council decides to use these assets is up to it.  The port will be a welcome boost following the granting of the planning application for the harbour innovation campus.  In addition, DLHC has significant fixed assets.  The dissolution of the port may present different opportunities to the council for funding that was not available to the port as an independent commercial port company, such as funding under the urban renewal scheme.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#NN00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>We are discussing this topic as a result of a request I made on the Order of Business last Thursday that we have a debate on the DLHC transfer in advance of the Minister signing the order, and I ask him to clarify whether he signed it today.  No Member has a problem with his strategy.  It is a good idea for harbour companies to come under the remit of a local authority as they might be well placed to manage them, albeit that they have plenty of other issues to manage.<\/p> <p>I am concerned that up to today, there was not full sight of the exact goings on in the harbour company and the exact extent of its assets and liabilities.  The Minister considers DLHC a company with a substantial asset, but it is only an asset if one can sell it off or one can do something with it.  It is all very well saying that one has an asset.  I am sure I have heard the Minister talk about constituents who are asset rich and cash poor, but there is an estimate of &euro;33 million in liabilities, which some people might say is less but equally other people could argue that it is greater, relating to pensions and works that are needed in the harbour, which might be referred to as \"taking in charge type standards\".  I am conscious that there are two other fellow former D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown councillors, Senators Richmond and Boyhan, in the House.  Senator Boyhan has great expertise because he served two terms on the board of the harbour company as an appointed director.  There was a time when the local authority had directors elected from the councillors.  At the time that was the case, my party was small and Fine Gael and Labour shared the spoils of those positions and, as a result, I was never a member of the DLHC but I am familiar with its activities.<\/p> <p>What will become clear to the 210,000 residents of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is there is a &euro;33 million liability in pensions and other infrastructural costs to be covered, in addition to an &euro;800,000 annual maintenance cost.  How is that to be absorbed without closing libraries and forgoing the repair of footpaths, improvements to traffic lights and the building of swimming pools, something that is close to the Minister's heart?  I did not have full sight of the liabilities but the due diligence referred to a liability of &euro;33 million.  All these works will have to be paid for and if he has signed over a &euro;33 million deficit in the company, which he says is an asset, is he suggesting that the county council should start selling off chunks of the harbour?   He referred to using reserves or profits, selling assets, borrowing or attracting private investment.  That is the antithesis of what some people who are championing the transfer of the harbour company into the ownership of the council wanted.  They do not want privatisation or the sale of assets; they want people power and so on.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Minister for the marine, the Minister has ports included in his brief and, as a Deputy for Dublin Rathdown, his constituents are affected by this.

That is not the Minister's fault but I am conscious of the time.  If we do not get a response today, we may need to come back and look at this issue again.  I hope we will all be relatively brief and we will give the Minister enough time.<\/p><p>I implore the Minister to answer the following question.  How is D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, other than by selling assets, which is what the Minister is arguing, or through private investment, to fund the &euro;33 million without increasing property tax or cutting other services?  That is the nub of the issue.  There are ongoing maintenance costs.  There are significant funding challenges.  The Minister is not transferring Dublin Airport, which is profit-making, to Fingal but he is transferring a loss-making operation with very significant long-term issues and infrastructural challenges.  It behoves the Minister to say to his constituents in Dublin Rathdown, but also to the constituents of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency and all the people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown who are paying their property tax, whether it will double or triple, or whether it will need to.  The discretionary property tax in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown this year, after the property tax discount was given to the highest property taxpayers in the country, is &euro;2.5 million.  One is talking about 13 years worth of discretionary property tax being swallowed up by the &euro;33 million and that is before one looks at the &euro;800,000 a year maintenance cost.<\/p><p>I have probably given the Minister enough issues to which to respond.

I will certainly put in a number of questions.<\/p><p>I am aware of the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and I put in a request to the Minister's Department and received an email telling me to contact an individual.  I did so today but I have not heard back.  That is not the individual's fault.  He may be away.<\/p><p>I will deal with a few issues.  My interest is in protecting the future of the harbour's estate, its employees, the real estate and marine leisure and related tourism potential.  The Minister has responsibility in that area too.  My interest is also in protecting D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, its elected members and its executive from unreasonable exposure to a potential of &euro;33 million.<\/p><p>The Minister was aware there was due diligence in relation to this company.  He had access to sensitive information about this company.  Will he not take some responsibility in relation to that?  Is it acceptable that he should saddle D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with which he is extremely familiar, with this?  He constantly sent out newsletters about his wonderful Glenalbyn pool but he did not get his pool or his Garda station.  The Minister is running; he is panicking.  He does not want lose his seat but he is motivated by the wrong things.  He is attacking the wrong people and is not supporting the local authority.  Why should a local authority, therefore, support the Minister?<\/p><p>The Minister is preoccupied with the Judiciary, with a little station in Stepaside and with a small swimming pool but he took it out on this local authority.  I am putting it to him that he took it out on this local authority because he did not get his way.  Hissy fits and tantrums do not get one somewhere.  I do not like to personalise it but the Minister likes to give it but does not like to take it.<\/p><p>The bottom line is there are issues, which I will summarise.  There is the EU grant and funding issues.  I am satisfied and have evidence that the Minister is aware of them and of the repayments in relation to them.  He is aware of the corporate governance issues, of which I am fully satisfied.  He is aware of the potential financial risk and exposure to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I am fully aware.  He is aware of, and gave advice on, HR issues, privately, of which I am fully aware.  Is the Minister in support of the trustees and the company's defined benefit pension scheme in respect of the future viability of the scheme with Invesco?  Is the Minister aware of a breach of the Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies?  Has he had sight of reports of the audit committee in terms of risk and remuneration?  Did he or any of his predecessors follow up on responses to parliamentary questions in respect of directors who were in breach?  There were conduct issues.  There were repayments to be made.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Finance, are aware of them.<\/p><p>The Minister lectures about transparency and accountability in respect of due diligence and the transfer of operations.  What has he done about it?  The Minister breezed in with a smile to tell us what he had done.  I had already heard it from the local authority.  I received a telephone call about ten minutes earlier.  I left here when I got the Minister's statement and faxed it to the 40 councillors.<\/p><p>The bottom line is this is not all over.  There will be no funding because the local authority will have to be prudent.  There will be no funding for phase 2 of Fernhill.  There will possibly be no funding for Marley Park or for Glenalbyn pool, and the Minister can lecture about it being ring-fenced.  He is not an elected member of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority.  The local authority can amend its capital programme at any time.<\/p><p>I do not want to hear a response from the Minister.  He has come in here unprepared to listen and to tell us what he has done despite telling us he would come in and listen to us.  I am exceptionally disappointed with the Minister.<\/p><p>I will give the Minister the following commitments.  I will make further inquiries in regard to the protected disclosures, I will put in a number of freedom of information requests on to these matters and I will speak at his next public meeting.  When he has his next meeting about Glenalbyn pool, Marley Park or Fernhill, I will tell the people another story.  They will not be hearing about it in the <i>Dublin Gazette<\/i>or <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  They will be hearing from big-mouth Boyhan, who will stand up and be counted and say what has to be said.<\/p><p>Enough is enough.  The Minister has let people down.  He is panicking; he is running.  That shows his inexperience as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and a Minister.  I am exceptionally disappointed in him and I really do not want to hear excuses from him.  He did not listen.  He signed off on this and he has come in here to tell us.  Big deal; the Minister has achieved little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#PP00700","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his statement.<\/p> <p>Like other speakers, I also was a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

I have a number of questions which I hope the Minister will answer in his reply.  If not, perhaps one of his officials would follow up with me on them in due course.  I had intended to ask if the order has been signed but the Minister has answered that question.  I understand it was signed today.  If so, at what time was it signed?  Will the Minister detail the engagement between his Department and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council since the ports policy was approved by Government?  Has the county council and the port company been in contact in preparation of the transfer?  I refer in this regard to the company as an entity and not the CEO.  Why is the port company being subsumed into the county council, rather than having the shareholding function transfer?  Will there be an indemnity for the county council against claims under way?  Have indemnities been provided to other local authorities in other transfers?  Will there be a package for any staff member wishing to leave and, if so, who will pay for it?  Have staff  been notified of the transfer?  I understand that under legislation, they are required to receive 30 days notification in this regard?  I would appreciate if the Minister could clarify if this is the case.  What assets are attached to the harbour company on its transfer?  Is Gresham House, a famous building in the town of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, being transferred?  Also, what is the value of that building and is there any debt attached to it?  <\/p><p>During the summer, it was reported that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Innovation Centre was being progressed by the harbour company and would generate &euro;1.5 million in rents and rates.  What is the status of this project?  Will additional local property tax be allowed to remain with to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to cover the cost of infrastructure?  As Senators Horkan and Boyhan will recall, 20% of local property tax receipts within D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown were transferred to local government and distributed around the country.  I held a public meeting last night - I am delighted Senator Boyhan was unable to attend - at which one of the key issues was reform of the local property tax system and where property taxes for the area are going.  When I take a walk or go for a run in Marlay Park, I like to know that my property tax is paying for that fantastic facility.  I look forward to going for a swim in Glenalbyn once again soon.  <\/p><p>What support was provided to other port companies and harbours that have transferred to local authorities?  The Minister mentioned Wicklow Port but other ports such as Drogheda and Tralee and Fenit have also been transferred.  He also mentioned that the national ports policy highlights that the future of the port is urban regeneration, leisure, public amenity and tourism.  Given that under Project Ireland 2040, which the Minister and I are enthusiastic supporters of, more than &euro;200 million is provided over the next decade for tourism capital, will he, given his responsibility for tourism, engage with the county council on accessing this funding? <\/p><p>I share the concern about this transfer but I welcome it.  I wish the Minister, his officials and the Government the best in this transfer but I intend to ensure that it does not negatively impact my home, my family's home and the facilities which I intend to spend the rest of my life enjoying.  This is a matter of most seriousness.  I look forward to a fulsome response from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#PP00800","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Horkan for calling for this debate.  The transfer of the functions of DLHC to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is shrouded in confusion.  It is disappointing that this debate falls on the day on which, I understand, the transfer is due to be completed.  The risk assessor's report has projected a net financial risk of &euro;33.5 million to the council, local property taxpayers, commercial ratepayers and the communities of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The Harbours Act 2015 provides for the transfer in respect of all assets, liabilities and staff in accordance with sections 30 and 32.  Option B is, therefore, not up for consideration by councillors.  Rather, they must consider the impact on the council's budget and whether the transfer will result in the cutting of vital services to communities and vulnerable groups in their area.  Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, said in the D&aacute;il that not all of the &euro;33.5 million liability would be transferred to the council.  This appears to be at odds with the Harbours Act and with what D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councillors have been told.  Without the benefit of a figure, the Government believes the county council will be liable for the socialising of semi-State private debt.  This warrants full scrutiny by the local authority.  A substantial liability could have a direct impact on its ability to provide local services and build the homes that are urgently required.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to clarify how he proposes to ensure the financial burden of this transfer does not impact unduly on the people of the area.  The staff of the harbour company have commenced the process of transferring contracts.  Can the Minister confirm that all pensions and entitlements of former employees will be honoured?  With the council now in charge of the historic harbour, perhaps fresh consideration will be given to the location of the national genealogical centre, incorporating a centre for migration and diaspora studies as proposed by the Genealogical Society of Ireland to the harbour company in 2011.  The idea was subsequently incorporated in the harbour company's 2013 proposal for a national diaspora centre and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown development plan supports this objective.  I encourage the council to work with the society to achieve this objective.  I also encourage the Department to engage with the society in support of this venture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#QQ00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for this debate.  In advance, I consulted my Green Party colleague and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councillor, Mr. Ossian Smyth.  The Minister will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, told the D&aacute;il last night that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council taxpayers will not be liable for the &euro;33.5 million costs incurred in this instance.  How much will the council have to pay?  Given the harbour company that accrued this debt is a semi-State entity, why is it not being borne by the Exchequer rather than a cash-strapped local authority?<\/p> <p>I understand that since the ferry service ended, the harbour company has attempted a number of far-fetched money making schemes, including a floating hotel, a floating swimming pool, a floating housing estate and a cruise ship dock that would have filled the harbour.  All of these schemes failed, leaving a trail of debt.  Does the Minister believe that it is fair that the residents of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown will have to pay for this wastage of money by the harbour company on pipe dreams?  Will the council now have to cut services to the residents and increase property tax in the area to meet the repayment of this debt run up by a semi-State agency under the watch of the Minister and his Department?  <\/p> <p>When established, the harbour company received the harbour assets with no debt attached from the Office of Public Works.  Is it fair that it is proposed to dump the debts of this semi-State agency on the Minister's constituents?  Does the Department expect the council to continue to pay the chief executive officer of this failed entity the &euro;168,000 package he is reportedly due until he chooses to retire?  Why was the chief executive office of the harbour company given a contract of indefinite duration when there is a seven-year term limit on serving as a chief executive of a semi-State agency?  Was it not negligence on the part of the Department to allow this happen?  Does the Minister believe that his constituents should foot the massive bill for a chief executive whose work will be done by council management into the future?  When on the Opposition benches, the Minister was keen on holding State agencies and fat cats to account.  I am a little shocked, therefore, to see him rewarding the boss of a failed semi-State agency in this way.  He would not have tolerated this when he was in opposition but now he is facilitating the Government in this matter.  I was informed by Councillor Smyth that the council is holding a special meeting this evening and that he is written to the Minister's office inviting him to attend.  I suggest that when this debate ends, the Minister should take the DART to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Minister knows, if it was a constituency meeting and there were votes at stake, he would be the first there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#QQ00300","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>What time is this debate due to finish?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#RR00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Unless there is a change to the Order of Business, it is to conclude at 5.30 p.m.  The Leader might amend the order of business so that the debate can run until 5.45 p.m., which would be an hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#RR00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>In case that change does not happen I will be very brief in order to allow the Minister time to respond.  There is real concern that capital projects are being placed in jeopardy in the council.  It is very clear that that is the case.  There is a smell about this when a Fine Gael Senator is raising questions that should have been dealt with by the party internally before any order was signed.  It stinks to high heaven at this late stage.  The Minister has said that there is a seven figure cash reserve, but I do not know why he is not telling us more about that.  He has told us there are fixed assets but he will not tell us how much they are worth or whether they are capable of being sold on.  We do not know what the liability of the local council is.<\/p> <p>A risk assessment was carried out.  Was the Dublin Port Company approached to take over D&uacute;n Laoghaire port at some stage?  Is it the case that it walked away once the risk assessment was carried out and that the council now is faced with the burden of risk?  We are having this debate with very little information.  Senator Boyhan made some very important points that must be answered for the sake of transparency.  There has been very little transparency about this.  The Seanad and the local council are both having the debate after the event.  We should have had statements on this move prior to any sign-over, and local councillors should have been kept fully informed about the liabilities they will be entering into.

I am not.  Deputy Creed is the Minister responsible for marine issues.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman could address those remarks to him.<\/p> <p>The exact extent of the liabilities was mentioned.  There has been much talk about liabilities, and several Senators have put on record that they amount to &euro;33 million.  It has been agreed between officials on all sides that that figure is not accurate.  The figure is closer to &euro;10 million, although it has not been agreed, and is well-known to anybody who has looked at the issue in any detail or who has any knowledge of the matter.  Those suggesting that the liability is &euro;33 million are being deliberately mischievous.  They are putting that figure out to scare people.  It is agreed that the figure of &euro;10 million is far closer to the reality, and will extend over a long period of time.  It arises due to a need to repair infrastructure, which is normal in a harbour.  It is not the case that &euro;10 million will be spent immediately.  It will be spent on the maintenance of the harbour, which any body or entity taking over the harbour would take on.  There is no &euro;33 million liability falling due tomorrow, or a &euro;10 million liability.  There is a future liability for repairs to be done, and that has to be accepted and will be absorbed.<\/p> <p>People are not taking into account the fact that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was in favour of this move by a massive majority.  I am not sure what the numbers were, but a very large majority said that it should be taken over by the local council.  It wanted it because this particular project will be in the interest of the citizens of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  That is what local councillors do.  They vote, they speak, they push and they urge in favour of their constituents.  One or two people are now saying that is not really what the council wanted, and claiming it did not want to inherit &euro;33 million in liabilities.  It is not being handed over &euro;33 million in liabilities.  Indeed, it is very doubtful that it is being handed &euro;10 million in liabilities.  I am not accusing anybody of being deliberately misleading, but the council is receiving a very large asset, including an asset rich company which has not been mentioned by a single person here this afternoon.  Its assets are worth up to &euro;40 million, with a single asset worth &euro;12 million.  Would the Senators not be glad to receive such an inheritance?  It is receiving &euro;40 million but might have to pay out &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million over the next ten years.  That is not a bad deal.  It is a gift.  It is a jewel that is being given to the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but it does not suit some people to acknowledge that.  <\/p> <p>What about income?  What about the cash-rich business to which Senator Humphreys referred?  For commercial reasons, it would not be wise of me to elaborate, but this company has certainly got a seven digit cash rich bank balance.  Would any Senator refuse that, or would they come bleating about the fact that they would have to pay for a few repairs down the road?  They would not, but it is very convenient to get up and shout about a figure of &euro;33 million that has been plucked out of the air.  It has been agreed by all sides, except for a few opportunist politicians, that that is not a credible figure.  That is what is going on here.  What has happened has been good for the citizens of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and an acknowledgement of Government policy.  Those who say it is ridiculous that the matter has come late to the Seanad could have raised it in here at any time in the last four years.  This has been delayed, and debated left, right and centre.  It should have been signed earlier.  It is a pity it was not signed earlier, but there was no great urgency at that stage.  People were not coming into this House and screaming about &euro;33 million then, or for the last six months.  They come in to complain afterwards because it is politically convenient.  <\/p> <p>This is a great deal for the residents of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It will make no difference whatsoever to funding, which has been bandied around in a politically opportunist way.  It will not affect local property tax or local projects.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire will benefit from this asset rich and cash rich transfer.  The local councillors were very enthusiastic about this transfer, as I am, and as I expected everyone in this House to be.  Suddenly, after the horse has bolted, people come in here thundering that this is a bad deal and that &euro;33 million is owed.  That is not the case.

I commend my colleagues in the Labour Party for bringing this Bill forward, which Sinn F&eacute;in is very happy to support.  Equality of wealth is a key objective for gender parity and it is a relevant issue.  We know that more equality benefits the economy.  It benefits many families in terms of increases in women's take-home pay.  In 1918, women were given the vote but, 100 years later, gender equality has still not been attained.  We can never underestimate the size of the task to reverse all history.  Patriarchy began when time began and the liberation of women means digging up the roots of human culture and nothing less.  Each generation witnessed a wave of brave women stepping up another rung on the ladder and each generation has to do it again until all sexism becomes bizarre ancient history to our great grandchildren.  A suite of measures needs to be introduced to cancel the motherhood penalty and the penalty for being a working mother, including improved shared parental leave, affordable childcare and flexible work practices.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is in favour of making public the names of companies that do not comply with the legislation and the amendment provides for that.  The people who engage with these companies, both customers and employees, should have access to this information.  They should be aware of the fact that they are giving their business to, or working for, a company that is failing to comply with the law.  That is why we propose that any company employing more than 100 staff that contravenes the provisions of this Act should have its company title published.  <\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes and will support the Bill.  We believe our amendment will bring greater transparency in the context of gender pay equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#SS01700","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate this important Bill.  I am grateful to all colleagues for supporting the Bill through Second and Committee Stages.  This Bill passed Second Stage in the Seanad with full support from all parties on 24 May 2017.  It then passed Committee Stage on 25 October 2017.  The Bill requires employers to publish information demonstrating any gap based on gender that exists in their organisation.  It is based on legislation introduced in other EU countries and would require companies with 50 or more employees to report regularly on pay transparency in the workplace.<\/p> <p>I have spoken with Senator Gavan and thank him and his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues for engaging with us on the Bill and for their support on earlier Stages.  I thank them for tabling an amendment on Report Stage, the intention of which is strengthen the Bill and its import.  The \"gender pay gap\" is the term used to describe the difference between the pay of women and men calculated on the basis of the average difference in gross hourly earnings.  In 2013, the European Commission showed that women in the EU earn approximately 16% less per hour than men.  In Ireland, women earn approximately 14% less than men, a figure equating to women in full-time employment working for free for about one month in every year.  Our legislation, which is a pay transparency Bill, aims to tackle this ongoing gender inequality head on.  We have had equal pay legislation on the Statute Book for more than 40 years.  That legislation tackles the somewhat different issue of pay discrimination between individual men and women in the workplace but has not addressed the ongoing macro-issue of the gender pay gap.  Many more actions are needed to tackle the gender pay gap.  <\/p> <p>I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators for raising the issue of publicity around companies that breach any provisions of the Bill.  Our Bill requires the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to collect the data and to take action against any companies that do not comply with measures aimed at addressing any gender pay gap that exists.  Of course, as the Minister of State will be aware, we are doing this to build on the existing powers of the commission.  However, we are mindful of the fact that the Government indicated previously its intention to propose amendments to the Bill and we indicated that we would be willing to accept amendments.  It is unfortunate that the Government has not done so but, instead, has said that it will introduce its own legislation to tackle the gender pay gap because that will delay the introduction of important pay transparency legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->By contrast, if this Bill is passed by the House tonight, as I hope and anticipate it will with cross-party support, we would see far speedier introduction of pay transparency legislation than through the Government's own Bill.  It has not yet been published, but once it is it will have to go through pre-legislative scrutiny and then all Stages in both Houses.  I have called previously on the Minister to take the approach of amending our Bill.  Having said all that, I would like to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  I am conscious, however, that I do not want anything to stand in the way of our Bill being passed by the House tonight as the Government previously indicated that it will not oppose it.  I have said this to Senator Gavan before and I know he appreciates the point.  The Bill passed on Second and Committee Stages here in the Seanad.  <\/p><p>Senator Clifford-Lee and her colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il have been equally supportive of the Bill, as has Sinn F&eacute;in and colleagues on the Independent benches.  I do not want to jeopardise cross-party support by changing the Bill at this Stage.  It is our intention, however, if it passes through the Seanad tonight to then introduce it in the D&aacute;il, hopefully with cross-party support.  The issues Senators Gavan and Devine are raising on publicity for companies that breach the legislation might be addressed at that point.  I do not want to accept it now.  I hope the Senators appreciate that I am not against it in principle, it is simply that it would be preferable for the Bill to pass, as is, in the Seanad tonight.  <\/p><p>I know the Minister of State is cognisant of the issues involved and I have said that before.  He was Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality when I authored that committee's report on women's participation in politics some years ago.  We brought in gender quota legislation on foot of that and we were mindful in bringing that forward of the obstacles to women's career progression.  They clearly contribute to the gender pay gap.  We call them the four Cs that apply in every job: old boy culture; cash, women tend to have a lack of cash; access to childcare; and, of course, confidence, women tend to lack confidence compared to male counterparts.  I know the Minister of State appreciates those.  We pointed out a fifth C in politics, namely, candidate selection procedures and we sought to tackle that through the gender quota legislation.  I see this legislation as very much in keeping with other measures we have introduced over the years to tackle gender inequality.  I know the Government is committed to these measures because there was a commitment to publishing and introducing pay transparency in the 2016 programme for Government.  We are anxious, however, to get this done speedily.  I also know the Minister of State appreciates that.  We think it could be done more quickly were the Government to accept this Bill without amendment.  That is why I say, with regret, I would rather not accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment and get the Bill through tonight.  <\/p><p>To deal specifically with the issue raised, we look at other jurisdictions, as we did in preparing this Bill.  There are some measures in other jurisdictions on publicity, naming, etc.  Since we debated this Bill last, we have seen companies in Britain publishing data.  Where gender pay gaps exist in British companies it is very much in the public domain.  I am thinking of the huge disparity between male and female employees exposed in airlines and the retail sector, for example, in Britain.  There is great merit in it.  In jurisdictions such as Australia, where gender pay gap legislation has been in place for a long time, companies are named but they name and fame as well as name and shame.  If we are looking at publicity for company names, we need to be mindful that there are organisations which have been positive and proactive in addressing the gender pay gap and they should be named and credited.  There are equal pay awards for those organisations in Australia where the gender pay gap has been addressed effectively and where improvements have been made.  That is the sort of measure that might well be in a final version of this Bill whenever it finally gets passed.  I am very grateful, again, to all of my colleagues for their support.  Regretfully, I feel it is not appropriate to accept the amendment tonight.  The principle behind it should be addressed with this Bill at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#SS01800","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik.

We support this Bill fully and we will do nothing to jeopardise its passing tonight, as I assured the House earlier.  I will say this to the Minister of State.  As I think he indicated earlier, he does not intend to oppose this Bill.  I hope that is still the case.  If it is, I ask him to consider not opposing our amendment either because it is the most moderate of amendments.  Section 46 of the existing Bill states that an employer which contravenes the provisions of a scheme made under this section is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  We support that provision.  The difficulty with the provision is that a class A fine has a value of &euro;5,000.  Let us be frank, the head of a large corporation is not going to be too worried about a &euro;5,000 fine.  We are not trying to change that.<\/p> <p>All we are saying, in addition to that, is that where a company does not comply with the legislation, by refusing to comply with publishing data, let us ensure that its name is published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  That is it.  There is nothing else.  The stars will not fall out of the heavens and everything will carry on as before.  We are simply asking that the name be published.  This is for a simple reason and Senator Bacik referred to it.  Publicity is going to be much more powerful in changing the gender pay gap than a fine.  We all recognise that.  If Senator Bacik's concern about our amendment is just that it might jeopardise the Bill, I ask the Minister of State to reassure her that just as he will not oppose the Bill, he will also not oppose this simple, extremely moderate measure.  It only says that if a company refuses to comply, if it refuses to release this data, then its name would be published.  That is all.  We will not be pushing this to a vote because we do not want to jeopardise the Bill.  It is a good Bill and it is great to see so much co-operation on this.  Equally, however, I can see no reason the Minister of State would oppose this.  It is such a small, simple point.  I hope that we can be reasonable, all of us together, and show politics working this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#TT00700","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan.

I do not want my daughter facing the gender pay gap but, equally, I do not want my son growing up in a country where the gender pay gap exists.

I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment, allow the passage of this legislation and also to support it as it goes through the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>I will make brief reference to the interesting and insightful presentations in the AV room last July from two UK experts on its legislation.  It showed some interesting findings that the principle has worked and given companies the boost they needed to address it.  Many people did not even realise what the gender pay gap was and that it existed prominently within their organisations.  It shows the value of this as one part of the overall fixing of the gender pay gap.<\/p> <p>Colleagues have referred to other issues such as culture and childcare.  We also spoke about the gender quota for political representation.  We are taking our seat at the table.  We need more women in the workforce, progressing through the workforce and taking their seat at the table in industry, commerce, law, healthcare and other areas.

The Senator made a very good point about the class A fine of &euro;5,000.  I do not have a legal background, but that would go through the District Court.  If the defendant is hit with a &euro;5,000 fine at that point, he or she will also have been hit with the publicity of a prosecution therefor.  That is the point.  It is not the sum of &euro;5,000.  If the case goes to the District Court, it will be publicised by the media.

I will just deal with the amendment.  That is my view on it.<\/p> <p>I appeal to the Minister of State.  A certain amount of energy has been spent in the House to get this to Report Stage.

It should be considered whoever becomes President.  We should be able to pride ourselves in this country on the way we treat people.  We have not had gender equality in this country's history.

Fine Gael will not have any problem accepting it, but it is really up to Senator Bacik because it is her Bill.  The name-and-shame principle should be applied to this.  When there are breaches of this nature, the sanction should not just be a fine.  Corporations write fines off.  The damage being named and shamed could do would be far greater than a &euro;5,000 fine.  We need to use the carrot, although it should not be required.

This is why we have chosen this one.  We feel that we have an opportunity to have cross-party support on this measure to take it to the next Stage.  The year we are in has been referenced in regard to gender equality, with the 100th anniversary of some women getting the franchise and this year's referendum.  There are very deep gender equality issues in our society which are still unresolved.  We separate children at primary school level on the basis of gender.  We are almost unique in that regard.  We separate children at secondary school level by gender.  That is disproportionately prevalent in Ireland, more so than in any European country.  One third of our secondary schools are gender-specific, which is very unusual.<\/p> <p>Women are under-represented in politics, in the media and on executive boards.  There are other countries that take steps in this regard.  It is not just Ireland, which insists on gender equality on State boards.  Germany has passed legislation to ensure gender equality on commercial corporate boards.  The measures we are taking are achievable and attainable and ones everybody in the House should support.  I absolutely concur with my colleagues that there is a window of opportunity here.  In a place where we can be very divisive and spot opportunities to have a go at each other, there is an opportunity to move this legislation to the next Stage, get it passed in the Seanad and possibly get it passed by Christmas.  That would put this House and the Oireachtas in general in a good light considering the current year.  I ask Members across the floor to take the goodwill that is evident from all parties and from the Government and move collectively to take this to the next Stage and get it passed.  We should apply the same spirit to the amendment.<\/p> <p>A huge amount of work has been put into this piece of legislation.  There has been research, and the researchers have been referenced.  I refer to the phrase that Hillary Clinton has often used: \"You cannot be what you cannot see\".

This is purely what we are trying to achieve with pay, which is basic and fundamental to how people operate in an economy.

Head 4 of that Bill would permit the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to apply to the Circuit Court for an order requiring an employer to comply with the regulations.  These proceedings would, of course, be in public.  Head 6 would allow an employee who claims that his or her employer is not complying with the regulations to bring a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  It also provides that where decisions of the Labour Court are appealed to that body, the relevant publications of decisions and determinations shall include the names of the parties involved.  This goes even further than the previous legislation.  The Government proposal contains provisions in respect of publicity, although not in the form envisaged in the amendment.

Senators already alluded to the fact that it is not a simple topic but that matters become quite complex when we start to drill down into it.  This is a very important issue and those on all sides are taking it seriously.  There is no division in the House on the matter.  I caution, however, that we should get this right versus getting it done speedily.  We have to get it right.<\/p><p>When I spoke on Committee Stage on 25 October 2017, I indicated that Government was in agreement with the principles behind the Bill but there were issues with the specific approach proposed.  Senator Bacik expressed a willingness to consider an alternative approach in which the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, would not have had the function of making the scheme for gender pay gap reporting, which would instead be the responsibility of the Government.  The way we have done it is that IHREC can make a scheme and has discretion on whether it will exercise that power.  The Government is saying that the Minister will make regulations and is required to do so.  There is a subtle difference there.  IHREC is totally independent and we want to respect that as well.  We are saying that the Minister shall make regulations, there are no ifs or buts.  The Minister is answerable to the Houses every week via parliamentary questions and so forth.<\/p><p>There are other issues as well but we said we would seriously examine the Bill with a view to bringing forth amendments on Report Stage and we did so.  That was very sincere at the time but when we really went into it in detail and got advice on it from the Office of the Attorney General and others, it was apparent to the Minister and me that the amendments required would be quite extensive and would extend to the Long and Short Titles of the Bill.  One fundamental difference between the Bill and the approach we propose is that the Private Members' Bill would amend the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, while our proposal in the Gender Pay Gap and Information Bill would mainly amend the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015.  The full extent of the differences between the present Bill and the Government's proposed approach can be seen by comparing the general scheme of the Gender Pay Gap and Information Bill with this Bill.  That was the advice that we received.  The principles that we have are identical and we all want to achieve the same result at the end of the day and I welcome the debate in this House on the occasions that I have been here, it has been very useful.  We are not opposing the Bill passing through the Seanad.  We will present the Gender Pay Gap and Information Bill to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad in due course.  As soon as the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has completed its pre-legislative scrutiny on the heads of the Bill, we will publish it.  I do not anticipate that the committee will bring forward any major changes but it may do so.  We have to respect that and wait until the committee has completed its work.<\/p><p>The heads of the Bill were approved by the Government on 26 June 2018 - no time was lost - and were subsequently published on <i>www.genderequality.ie<\/i>and immediately forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  The committee will conduct pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme in late November and I look forward to that.  Drafting of the Bill is at a very advanced stage and I look forward to its presentation as soon as possible after the pre-legislative scrutiny is completed.  The advice that we received is that it would be easier to bring forward a new, more straightforward Bill than to amend this Bill but the thrust and the philosophy behind both of them are exactly the same.  We all wish to achieve the same thing.  This is a very interesting, challenging and complex area when we drill down into it.  We have done much work and carried out much consultation in this area and all those I have engaged with on this - employers, trade unions, workers and big and small businesses - want to get it right.<\/p><p>The Government is approaching this from the point of view of fame rather than shame and many companies want to be on the right side of it.  I thank colleagues here for their sincerity and co-operation in respect of this matter.  Prior to Christmas - Senator Humphreys mention Christmas on a few occasions, and it is getting close - when pre-legislative scrutiny has been completed, I hope to be in a position to bring the Bill before the House in order that we might discuss it in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018100300002#VV02200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1538559000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying his intentions on the Government Bill and, as he stated, we are seeking to be constructive.  Everybody is in agreement on where we wish to be.  We all wish to see pay transparency legislation introduced and to tackle the ongoing gender pay gap.  However, it has been nearly a year since the Bill before the House passed Committee Stage.  The Minister of State clarified that the scheme of the Government's Bill is with the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and that the latter will hopefully commence pre-legislative scrutiny in late November, but I still say that it would have been speedier to have simply amended this Bill.  There is a record of the Government extensively amending Private Members' Bills in this House.  I refer, for example, to the Competition (Amendment) Act 2017, which, with extensive amendment by Government, was passed by the Houses in the aftermath of collaboration between the Labour Party and officials in the relevant Department.  The same could have been done in this instance.<\/p> <p>That said, I am grateful to the Minister of State for his engagement on this.  I met with him and his officials during the summer months.  At that point, he spoke to me about the proposal to use the Workplace Relations Commission and not to have IHREC as the body collecting the data and we were in agreement with him on accepting amendments to that effect.  I appreciate that IHREC would have required significant extra resources to be in a position to collect the data.  It probably would not have been appropriate and I accepted that.  I still have a slight concern about the scheme as proposed by Government in terms of enforcement.  I expressed that concern to the Minister of State and his officials.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State's Bill proposes to amend the employment equality legislation and would not give power of enforcement to IHREC.  Given the commission has powers to conduct equality reviews and audits under the existing legislation, it would be a missed opportunity not to give it similar powers in respect of gender pay gaps.  It seems strange not to give those powers to the commission in this case.  It is uncontroversial, of course, as the EU Commission and many other bodies are seeking gender pay gap legislation.  It is important that this be done.  It would have been nice to have it done in the year of V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 and the centenary of women's suffrage, to which Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred.  It is a pity because this could have been done more swiftly.  There has been extensive consultation.  The Minister of State's Department engaged in extensive consultation with stakeholders.  All of this needs to be said.  Having said all of this, if the Minister of State's Bill is introduced before this legislation proceeds through the D&aacute;il, I hope it will be introduced in the Seanad given we have had extensive debates.
