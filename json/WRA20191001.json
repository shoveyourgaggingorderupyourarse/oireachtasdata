The challenges posed by a no-deal departure will be particularly acute.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been putting in place the utmost Brexit preparations since even before the outcome of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership became known.  Since then, Budget 2017, Budget 2018 and Budget 2019 have all contained measures to ensure that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring. <\/p>  <p>  These measures continue the process of assuring that Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains competitive and resilient against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty, and include balancing our books; reducing our debt burden; putting in place a major programme of capital investment; establishing the Rainy Day Fund; and broadening the tax base.<\/p>  <p>  Specific initiatives have been introduced aimed at supporting those sectors most affected by Brexit, most notably the Brexit Loan Scheme in Budget 2018 and the Future Growth Loan Scheme in Budget 2019.  The Future Growth Loan Scheme is open to eligible Irish enterprises, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital loans, at least 40% of which is available for food businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and its agencies have also put in place extensive supports and advisory resources to ensure that the sectors likely to be most impacted are prepared for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the Summer Economic Statement set out two budgetary scenarios for Budget 2020, the first involving an orderly departure by the UK from the EU and the second involving a disorderly exit.  Last month the Government decided that the budgetary strategy to be adopted should be based on the latter assumption. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government has already said that it will provide counter-cyclical support to the economy through social protection payments occasioned by higher unemployment and, on the revenue side, lower tax collections which help cushion aggregate demand. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government will also introduce timely, targeted, temporary measures. Brexit contingency support may also be needed to address specific issues in the event of a &lsquo;worst case scenario&rsquo; disorderly Brexit.  I am working with the relevant Ministers on such measures in the context of Budget 2020.<\/p>  <p>  All of these measures form part of a comprehensive response to Brexit across all sectors which has been set out in the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, which was updated in July. This is the second update of the Plan that was originally published in December 2018 and reflects the extensive work that  has taken place to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s management of the economy, however, means that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit from a position of economic strength.  The Irish economy continues to grow at a robust pace and we are close to full employment.  But we do not underestimate the challenges ahead and will be prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100059#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":15,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 66 to 74, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Status","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100059#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[39569\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100059#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the Crossmolina flood relief scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>This important project is now at an advanced stage with detailed design work nearing completion to determine the final design plan for the flood alleviation works.<\/p><p>Hydraulic modelling required for the design of the proposed channel diversion established that there was a need for an in-stream flow control structure to minimise the overall environmental impact on the river system.<\/p><p>Necessary work is now taking place to identify ecological and environmental constraints associated with the in-stream works required for the proposed flow-control structure.

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of the proposals.  <\/p><p>Regarding question 39806\/19, I am advised by Revenue that capital gains tax (CGT) entrepreneur relief applies to an individual who disposes of qualifying assets which have been owned by that individual for a continuous period of at least 3 years in the 5-year period immediately prior to the disposal of the assets. The rate of CGT on such disposals is 10%. <\/p><p>To qualify for CGT entrepreneur relief, the qualifying assets must have been used for the purposes of a qualifying business carried on by the individual disposing of the assets.

are defined as either a period of severe economic downturn or a period during which an unusual event outside the control of the State has a major impact on the financial position of the general government.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund is intended, therefore, to be used as a defined-purpose instrument to address severe events, as opposed to the normal fluctuations within the economic cycle. This approach would align it with the current EU fiscal rules framework, whereby it could be accommodated as an &ldquo;unusual event&rdquo; under the existing Stability and Growth Pact provisions. Withdrawals from the Fund will be transferred directly to the Exchequer so as to support the tax shortfalls and\/or voted expenditure\u00a0to address the specific downturn.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Act deliberately does not describe specific events, such as Brexit or others, so as to\u00a0give\u00a0flexibility to Governments\u00a0to\u00a0withdraw from the Fund\u00a0for all severe downturns,\u00a0many of which are not possible to specify in advance. <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the occurrence of a force majeure event could justify deployment of the Fund.

As I set out in that response, as with other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences such as failure to submit returns or other documentation or the provision of false information. <\/p>  <p>  Section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the imposition of such surcharges for the late payment of Local Property Tax. The challenge of compliance is particularly significant for LPT owing to the nature of the tax itself and the wide demographic liable for the tax, a significant proportion of which are not taxpayers to whom the standard collection and enforcement methods could be applied. Compliance is not just about ensuring the submission of returns and the payment of outstanding tax liabilities; there is also a timing aspect to compliance. \u00a0Returns must be submitted and payments must be made by a specified date(s).\u00a0 The\u00a0suggestion in the Deputy's question,\u00a0of reducing a penalty to nil following the late submission of returns or payments, would only serve to incentivise such late submission. Likewise, as outlined in my previous response, a surcharge is designed to act as a deterrent and, when there is a late compliance, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability: this considered a fair and proportionate deterrent given the size of LPT liabilities. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to comparisons between the treatment of PAYE workers and the self-employed, unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit a return on time. Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to collect LPT liabilities through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension, which is considered to be a fair approach in the context of the surcharge on income tax that can apply to self-employed taxpayers who fail to meet their LPT liabilities.\u00a0 Moreover, all taxpayers who fail to submit an LPT return, or who submit an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.<\/p>  <p>  Adding \u00a0the LPT liability to a self-employed person&rsquo;s income tax liability, as the Deputy suggests, would not, of itself, ensure that the LPT was actually paid. This would not be a similar treatment to a PAYE taxpayer who has no choice about when, or how much of, his or her LPT liability is paid, where deduction at source by the employer or pension provider is made mandatory.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time.

A number of measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the scale of Government expenditure, over &euro;66 billion in aggregate for 2019, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons. This includes in-year policy decisions, timing issues, overspends in particular areas and the need to respond to emerging events where Departments do not have scope to deliver offsetting savings.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at policy decisions that would require a Supplementary Estimate, this would include the decision in relation to this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Christmas Bonus.  Turning to  areas where there are potential pressures that would give rise to overspends, as outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, there are particular challenges in the area of Health taking into account the year-on-year increase and the expenditure profile for the last quarter of the year, and also in Justice arising from pressures in relation to Asylum Seekers Accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the continued uncertainty in relation to the timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union has required that the impacted Departments and Offices incur expenditure to ensure that we are in a position to respond to the emerging position. To the extent that offsetting underspends are not available this would necessitate certain Supplementary Estimates.<\/p>  <p>  At this stage in the year, it is too early to definitively state what the requirement for Supplementary Estimates will be at year-end. The White Paper to be published this Friday will set out the aggregate forecast expenditure outturn for the year taking into account an assessment of potential Supplementary Estimate requirements.   Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment on a Vote Group basis of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Turning to the question of particularly sensitive areas that may require additional resources in the coming year, in light of the current position in relation to the UK's exit from the EU, Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Underlying this decision is the need to ensure the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of the Brexit challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This strategy involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach of providing funding for key public services and also supporting the sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit related disruption. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining sustainable expenditure policy is an important element of meeting our EU obligations in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal policy more generally. This includes ensuring that we are achieving the greatest possible impact with public expenditure and delivering high quality public services in an efficient and effective manner. A range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also just come to the end of year three of this phase of the Spending Review process. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. A number of papers resulting from the review process were published over the summer, with the remainder due to be published alongside the Expenditure Report on Budget Day. <\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, maintaining sustainable expenditure policy has also been crucial in restoring our economy following the economic crisis. Following a period of consolidation, the last number of years have seen moderate, sustainable expenditure growth on an annual basis. The Government has prioritised spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity whilst making incremental and sustainable improvements in public services. The steady growth in expenditure in recent years reflects the significant effort made by this Government to moderate the level of expenditure increases and to secure a sustainable long-term path to growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100064#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[39965\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100064#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which progress continues to be made towards restoration of various cutbacks experienced during the economic crash; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>Following a period of consolidation after the economic crisis, over the last number of years there has been modest growth in expenditure.

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB\u00a0Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department.\u00a0This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.\u00a0\u00a0The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.\u00a0 These schemes\u00a0have been superseded by the more\u00a0extensive capitation grant schemes.\u00a0 The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.\u00a0 It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.\u00a0 This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys\u00a0on the 10th of July\u00a0to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim.

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. <\/p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>This process will recommence in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.<\/p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Services Staff","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH03900"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[39737\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to implement proper pay and working conditions as sought by school secretaries following the recent work stoppage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools. \u00a0I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier\u00a0this year I\u00a0relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school\u00a0secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB\u00a0Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department.\u00a0This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.\u00a0\u00a0The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.\u00a0 These schemes\u00a0have been superseded by the more\u00a0extensive capitation grant schemes.\u00a0 The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.\u00a0 It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.\u00a0 This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys\u00a0on the 10th of July\u00a0to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of\u00a0the survey analysis.\u00a0 In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered unwarranted, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last week. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Department restated to the trade union that their claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys. \u00a0 The Department reiterated its view\u00a0to the union that any industrial action is premature and unwarranted, and called on F&Oacute;RSA to reconsider their action. <\/p>  <p>  As the Union has previously been advised, the Department remains fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA on completion of the survey work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":432,"content":"<p>Question No. 218 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04300"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[39757\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for a SNA for a child (details supplied);

A licence is required to import fireworks in any of these categories. <\/p><p>I can further confirm that licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators. <\/p><p>Under Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, it is an offence:<\/p><p>-for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,<\/p><p>-to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and<\/p><p>-to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.<\/p><p>Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 also gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.  <\/p><p>The penalties provided for in connection with these offences are very severe.

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which addresses the rights of children to legal security, to the care of their parents and important adults in their lives, and to equality before the law.\u00a0 The reforms in family law provided for in that Act\u00a0recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.  <\/p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children. Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter. If the father is not married to the mother of the child, he will not automatically become a guardian of the child. The issue of automatic guardianship was considered during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas. However, the automatic extension of guardianship to a father who is not involved and is not participating in his child&rsquo;s life would have consequences for the child and the child&rsquo;s mother, for example, if he does not consent to the issue of a passport or to the placement of a child for adoption. <\/p>  <p>  There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children. Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) now provides for joint guardianship by a man who was not married to the mother of the child and was cohabiting with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months. This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than 3 months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child. In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian.

A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also involved in operational activity where appropriate. The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.<\/p><p>The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is jointly chaired at senior management level by the two police services, to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.  As a multi-agency coordination structure, the Task Force does not have a separate staffing complement or budget. Personnel from the participating agencies in both jurisdictions are assigned for specific operations and other capacities from the relevant agencies are deployed as required by operational demands.<\/p><p>The Task Force has made strong progress in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime. <\/p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, as well as specific joint investigations which take place when individual crime incidents with a cross border dimension occur, such as the one underway into a recent horrific case of abduction and assault. <\/p><p>Last week, together with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, senior officers from all the agencies and senior officials from Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my own Department, I attended the 17th Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co.

Operational members of the Task Force came together at the conference, which provided an opportunity to consider in detail the necessary improvements and innovations, including international co-operation. While the work of the Task Force is reviewed as part of the annual cross border conference on organised crime, there is ongoing multiagency engagement in relation to operations to tackle cross border crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Sector","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL03700"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[39717\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to prohibit the use of sponsorship on children&rsquo;s replica jerseys when that sponsor is a gambling company or promotes gambling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises an interesting issue with regard to sponsors names carried on replica jerseys.

This is an exceptional rate of endorsement. <\/p>  <p>  Over 85% of penalty point offence records are received directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when the offender opts to pay the fixed charge amount and accept the penalty points. The remainder - the minority - are received from the Courts Service, following convictions. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am acutely aware of the road traffic enforcement challenges that result from the non-surrender of driving licences.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of roadside intercept detections, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can record the driving licence details obtained at the point of interception. This can ultimately be used to apply penalty points, should there be a conviction. In such instances, the recording of a licence in court may not be necessary. <\/p>  <p>  However, an issue may still arise where the licence details are not obtained at the point of interception.  For example, in the case of non-intercept speed camera detections, the registration of the vehicle is captured on detection.  If a driver does not pay his\/her Fixed Charge Notice and is subsequently convicted, his\/her licence details should be recorded in Court in accordance with section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016.  Unfortunately, there are instances when the Court is unable to record licence details, for example when licences are reported to the Court as lost or forgotten, or where persons are convicted of speeding while also driving without a licence.  There are also some drivers who wilfully choose not to attend Court and are convicted in absentia. Again, there is no licence to record in these cases. <\/p>  <p>  In cases where a licence is not provided, I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has the facility, in certain instances, to look up the National Vehicle and Driver File and successfully apply penalty points, based on exact matching against the offence's vehicle registration details.<\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority, the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met in August to discuss road traffic enforcement and that the non-production of driving licences was one of the matters discussed at this meeting. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group, chaired by officials from both my Department and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and attended by the Courts Service among other agencies, actively monitors progress and relevant developments in the area of road traffic enforcement. I have asked my officials to meet with Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Courts Service via this forum to discuss how the process of obtaining driver information upon conviction is currently operating under section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016. The Working Group will meet during October and I can confirm to the Deputy that this important enforcement issue will be discussed. I am happy to update the Deputy further after the appropriate meeting has taken place.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Master Licence Record programme, established by Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is implementing further measures to assist in endorsement of penalty points by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF. This project will go some way to addressing the issue of 'unmatched offences' by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF, and, over time, by establishing owner identity for all vehicle records. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Shane Ross, T.D., who has responsibility for road traffic legislation that, due to legislative and operational issues, full population of the Master Licence Record Programme is likely to take several years.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to acknowledge that there will be always be complex scenarios when attempting to endorse driving licences in respect of road traffic offences; for example, instances where the vehicle owner is not driving at the time of an offence, or when an offending vehicle is owned by a company. It is equally important to note that disqualified drivers constitute a major component of those who do not surrender driving licences. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that Minister Ross has proposed the amendment of section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to remove the existing Garda discretion to allow a driver 10 days in which to produce his\/her licence\/learner permit at a Garda station and, as a result, to provide for the mandatory carry of licence\/permit. This proposal will be discussed further over the coming period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":619,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL04900"},{"type":"question","counter":620,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[39783\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the development of the new Garda station in Clonmel, County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":621,"content":"<p>The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro;92 million this year.

Complexities may also arise at local level, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply for legal aid to Ennis Law Centre.

This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special reception needs of vulnerable persons.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland\u00a0transposed the Directive by way of the European Communities (Reception\u00a0Conditions) Regulations 2018. While there is no formal procedure in place for vulnerability assessments, Regulation 8 refers to vulnerable persons and provides for\u00a0an assessment in relation to an applicant's special reception needs within 30 days of presentation or application.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Every applicant has an initial interview conducted when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin. If the applicant indicates that they require accommodation , he or she will\u00a0then be assessed for any specific reception needs. The result of the assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the individual.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Applicants are also invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. A Health Screening Team, which is funded and managed by the HSE, is located onsite at the Balseskin Reception Centre for this purpose. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical\/administration support. The team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs\u00a0and makes onward referrals for\u00a0any further treatment required. These health professionals communicate with\u00a0my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS - formerly RIA), within the bounds of patient confidentiality, if a particular need is identified that\u00a0will impact the person's accommodation requirements. In the coming weeks, a new primary care facility will be opening in Balseskin, which will enable the health care team to provide their services in a facility that is to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements are in\u00a0place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer the screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin. Staff from Safetynet liaise with the IPAS if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that special arrangements should be taken regarding the assignment of the person's accommodation, for example if they need to be located near a particular hospital. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continually reviewing how\u00a0to improve services to applicants and my officials are currently examining the options available for putting in place a formal procedure for the identification and assessment of those applicants deemed to be vulnerable in accordance with Article 21 of the Reception Conditions Directive.<\/p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can\u00a0meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes. I\u00a0look forward to the outcome of this research.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that all\u00a0Departments and\u00a0their agencies involved in\u00a0the delivery of services and supports to applicants have a role to play in\u00a0identifying and addressing the needs of applicants who present as vulnerable.

The functions of INAB include the provision of\u00a0accreditation in accordance with the relevant International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 17000 series of standards and guides.<\/p>  <p>  INAB is the sole national accreditation body for Ireland as appointed under EU Regulation 765\/2008. The provision of the accreditation service for Irish enterprises is managed by the INAB executive and over seen by the INAB Board with the support of externally contracted expertise. INAB acts independently in carrying out its accreditation roles.<\/p>  <p>  Following the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in June 2014 INAB became a committee of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA). <\/p>  <p>  The primary nature of contact between Departmental officials and INAB officials is related to the appointment of Notified Bodies. My Department is the\u00a0Notifying Authority for the conformity assessment of certain products being placed on the EU internal market. If a Conformity Assessment Body applies to my Department to be appointed as a Notified Body under certain EU Directives (see attached at Appendix 1) then the Department seeks confirmation from INAB officials that the Conformity Assessment Body has received accreditation from INAB. This arises only in relation to accreditation provided by INAB to a Conformity Assessment Body under a specific number of EU Directives and it is in this context that my Department would seek information from INAB on individual accreditations. <\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the Department has no role in relation to decisions made by INAB as to who should be accredited and\/or how the accreditation process should be conducted by INAB as INAB carries out this role independently. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, officials from my Department have been in regular contact with INAB officials for the last few years in relation to matters concerning accreditation processes in the context of Brexit.

I am consistently engaging and listening to the needs of start-ups and established small businesses. <\/p><p>I am keenly aware of their importance as SMEs account for 99.8% of all enterprises in the State and are predominantly indigenous. My Department through its Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), provides a range of tailored supports to small and medium enterprises. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion. <\/p><p>Ireland continues to be very supportive of entrepreneurial activity and once again ranks 1<sup>st<\/sup>in Europe in terms of our entrepreneurs being held in high esteem. The 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor annual index of early stage entrepreneurs indicates that Ireland had increased rates of entrepreneurship in 2018 and holds a position of 5<sup>th<\/sup>in Europe compared to 6<sup>th<\/sup>in 2017. Importantly, also reported is that\u00a0the gap between male and female entrepreneurs has continued to narrow from a previous 2 to 1 ratio to a ratio of\u00a01.6 to 1 in 2018. <\/p><p>While Ireland has a healthy and positive perception of entrepreneurship, I am cognisant of the need to create and support an environment where our budding entrepreneurs can thrive and succeed. <\/p><p>That is why in the 2019 Budget I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices.\u00a0 This extra funding assists our Agencies to reach more of our entrepreneurs and SMEs to help grow and scale their businesses which are at the heart of our economic growth. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) team provides support and advice to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and the potential to export.<\/p><p>The 31 LEOs are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other non-financial supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business. The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.<\/p><p>My Department also runs the www.supportingsmes.gov.ie online portal that enables start-ups and small business to navigate the supports available from all the different government departments, agencies and initiatives. This online tool also advertises upcoming events that would be of interest to entrepreneurs and established SME&rsquo;s such as financial literacy classes or business management workshops. <\/p><p>To further my commitment to the future growth of our indigenous small and medium enterprises, I commissioned the OECD Review of SME Policies in Ireland in March 2018. <\/p><p>The aim of the review is to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to my Department and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. <\/p><p>This is a collaborative body of work and involves considerable input from Government departments, agencies, representative groups and most importantly, indigenous businesses themselves.

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and\u00a0are priced in a cost-effective manner.\u00a0 Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products do occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis, it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new uses of existing medicines representing a significant investment by the HSE\u00a0to provide access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.\u00a0 It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next five years.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100071#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100071#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[39286\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100071#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for a hospital appointment; the number of persons ahead of them on the list; his plans to invest in the service to improve the waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":702,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HSE advises that this is because there is no evidence that screening would be of any benefit to them. At this stage in life, normal cell changes in the cervix can look very like abnormal cells. If CervicalCheck tested women under 25, changes that are normal might be treated as abnormal and a woman could be sent for treatment when they don't need it. Invasive cervical cancer is also very rare at this age.\u00a0The HSE advises any woman under 25 who is worried about their risk of developing cervical cancer to speak to their GP.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This approach is in line with screening programmes in other countries.\u00a0The UK National Screening Committee recommended in November 2012 that the age of first invitation for cervical screening should be raised to 25 in Wales and Scotland on the basis that there is evidence of a large number of women screened and treated with relatively little benefit below this age. <\/p>  <p>  Cancer screening is one important aspect of cancer prevention, and another is vaccination.

This principle applies to all consumers who are ordinarily resident in the country (here for a period of more than one year) as is set out in health insurance legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of non-EEA students wishing to secure a visa to stay and study in Ireland, one of the requirements set down by the Department of Justice (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service), is that these students have health insurance for the period of their stay, so that they may not be a burden on the Irish public health system.<\/p>  <p>  Within this particular cohort there are those who are resident here for more than one year and therefore the community rating principle applies when they buy their insurance policies in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The High Court last year upheld the issuance by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) of an enforcement notice to an insurer, instructing this insurer to cease selling non-community rated policies to non-EEA students resident in the country for more than one year. <\/p>  <p>  If non-EEA students who are resident here for more than one year wish to purchase health insurance in Ireland, they may purchase community rated products from other companies that are registered with the HIA. Each of the three open membership insurers (Irish Life Health, Laya Healthcare and Vhi) have starter plans which offer coverage in most public hospitals and range in price from &euro;480-500 per annum. Insurers also offer young adult rates on many of their products, which further reduces the premium for young people availing of health insurance. The rates range from 50% of adult premium for someone aged 18, up to full adult premium for a 26 year old person.<\/p>  <p>  All health insurance policies sold in Ireland must also include a set of minimum benefits. These benefits are called the Minimum Benefit Regulations and are set out in health insurance legislation. They include a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population. Coverage for repatriation is not included in these regulations and therefore health insurance policies sold in Ireland do not need to provide cover for this circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100073#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":821,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100073#WRP01900"},{"type":"question","counter":822,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[39442\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100073#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeline for the provision of the new 50-bed unit in Portiuncula Hospital, County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":823,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive recently published its Capital Plan for 2019-2021 outlining 250 projects to be progressed over the three-year period.<\/p><p>The Capital Plan includes the provision of a new 50 bed ward block at Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects and has advised that the project is currently at tender stage for the enabling works, which are expected to commence later this year or early next year, with a view to progressing towards the construction phase once the enabling works have been completed.

To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list.

also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child.\u00a0 The childhood immunisation programme in Ireland has had a huge impact in improving the health of the Irish people.\u00a0 Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world such as polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and many other serious infectious diseases are now preventable by vaccination.\u00a0 However, due to misinformation vaccination rates are not as high as they should be. <\/p>  <p>One of my priorities as Minister for Health is to increase vaccination rates across the country and I am exploring several options in this regard.\u00a0 I launched the Vaccine Alliance on the 10   September whose aim is to increase uptake rates of childhood vaccines and reduce vaccine hesitancy.\u00a0 The group includes a wide range of organisations and further organisations will be added once the terms of reference, key target audiences, and priorities for the Vaccine Alliance have been agreed.\u00a0 It is important to note that vaccine hesitancy is not unique to Ireland. \u00a0It is a global issue and has been identified by the World Health Organisation as one of the ten leading threats to global health in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware the immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).\u00a0 NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in several specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.\u00a0 The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.\u00a0 It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.\u00a0 NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.\u00a0 Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.\u00a0 The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.\u00a0 The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to.\u00a0 All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the EMA's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that as all vaccines used in Ireland&rsquo;s immunisation programmes have been approved for use in the European Union by the EMA there is no requirement for indemnity to be provided to vaccine manufacturers.<\/p>  <p>  Aluminium has been used in vaccines for many decades to improve the body's response to vaccination.\u00a0 It is a component of the HPV vaccine Gardasil and several other vaccines.\u00a0 The World Health Organisation's (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine safety (an expert clinical and scientific advisory body) has concluded that there is no evidence of a health risk from aluminium-containing vaccines. <\/p>  <p>  I am also informed by the HPRA that there is no thiomersal in any of the vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the HPRA that at present there are three types of vaccine strains authorised in IE which are manufactured in cell lines which were originally derived from foetal tissue.\u00a0 The Rubella vaccine strain is produced in the Wistar RA 27\/3 cell line while the hepatitis A and varicella vaccine strains are expressed in the MRC-5 human diploid cell line.\u00a0 No new foetal tissue has been used in the manufacture of either rubella, hepatitis A or varicella antigens since the development of the original cell lines.\u00a0 Following production, the vaccines are purified from the cell line expression system and the purity of the vaccine formulation has to be demonstrated in line with regulatory standards.\u00a0 This includes limiting process-related impurities derived from the manufacturing process i.e. the cell expression system (e.g. host cell proteins, host cell DNA).\u00a0 The WHO has concluded that levels of up to 10 ng of residual host cell DNA can be considered as acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to use in humans all vaccine formulations undergo preclinical testing.\u00a0 These typically involve a range of in vitro tests followed by a comprehensive range of toxicity studies in animals.\u00a0 These studies identify potential safety concerns and serve to avoid possible harm to human subjects.\u00a0 Clinical safety studies are conducted during the clinical trials and the safety data that is collected is based on events reported after each dose of vaccine and also events reported after a longer time post-vaccination.\u00a0 Clinical trials run for a defined period and safety data will be collected from trial participants for a defined period post vaccination.\u00a0 This period of time may differ between trials.\u00a0 In addition, vaccines on the market are continuously monitored to provide additional safety data and to identify adverse reactions.\u00a0 Under the regulatory framework, benefit-risk evaluations continue to be carried out throughout the product lifecycle.<\/p>  <p>  Manufacture of vaccines must also comply with good manufacturing standards and regulatory requirements in EU and national legislation to ensure that the materials and methods used are appropriate.\u00a0 Vaccine manufactures are subject to independent assessment and inspection by national medicines agencies.\u00a0 It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.\u00a0 The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100074#WRQ05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services

The General Scheme has been sent to the relevant Joint Committee and I look forward to participating in pre-legislative scrutiny when a date is agreed with the Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100077#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1047,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100077#WRT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1048,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[39926\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100077#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the final agreed tender price, the date of the tender for the contract and the final overall amount paid and the date of the final payment in respect of each capital expenditure project completed since 1 January 2014 by his Department or an agency under the remit of his Department and which ended up costing &euro;10 million or more in tabular form; the reason the final amount paid exceeded the final tender price; the details available in respect of projects in which construction is not complete to date or in which the final settlement account has not been agreed to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1049,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100077#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1050,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100077#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[39938\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100077#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1052,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is fuelled by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million fully electric or hybrid vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants.<\/p><p>In relation to the Clean Air Strategy, it will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect across Government in a manner consistent with national priorities, EU and other international policy considerations. The Clean Air Strategy will address a range of harmful air pollutants in Ireland, including those arising from the agricultural, transport and residential heating sectors, in an integrated manner. <\/p><p>Given the wide range of pollutant sources, it is important that action is coordinated across various sectors. In this regard, the Department consulted widely, including with other Departments, State Agencies, and industry bodies on the formulation of the Cleaning Our Air issues paper, which was itself the subject of a public consultation. In addition, a number of plans have been under development recently, including the National Air Pollution Control Programme, the National Energy and Climate Plan, and the Climate Action Plan, which are relevant to the clean air agenda. I am keen to ensure that synergies are maximised between these plans and the National Clean Air Strategy, with a view to achieving lasting reductions in the health and environmental impacts of air pollution.

The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. <\/p>  <p>  The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. In May I brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. <\/p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close. The finalisation of financial closure and legal requirements are progressing towards contract award. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. <\/p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.<\/p>  <p>  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. <\/p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.<\/p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy makes reference to the premises' proximity to a commercial deployment of broadband. This deployment is part of eir's commercial roll out of high speed broadband to 300,000 predominantly rural premises, in line with a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. <\/p>  <p>  eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network. Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of the Commitment Agreement, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. <\/p>  <p>  Decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis. I have no statutory role or function in such commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100078#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prospecting Licences","counter":1133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100078#WRU03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1134,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[39359\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100078#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of a prospecting licence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[39360\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100078#WRU03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to request that a company (details supplied) surrender a prospecting licence in view of its declaration that it no longer has an interest in a project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 and 455 together.<\/p><p>The company referred to by the Deputy currently holds a Prospecting Licence for PLA 934 which is due to expire the 30<sup>th<\/sup>December, 2019.

By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is fuelled by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million fully electric or hybrid vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants.<\/p>  <p>  Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. <\/p>  <p>  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. <\/p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban. <\/p>  <p>  This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society.<\/p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution. The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban which is in currently in place in cities and many towns around the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Attorney General has provided legal advice on this matter. I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan, which will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardizing the existing ban. <\/p>  <p>  I also intend to publish a Clean Air Strategy, which will set out a number of policies to improve air quality nationwide in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of appropriate policy measures to tackle it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100079#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Action Fund","counter":1168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100079#WRV00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1169,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[39567\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100079#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the amount allocated to the climate action fund in the first round; when the next round of funding will be announced; the value of the fund; the percentage of the funding for public sector applications under the first round allocations; and the percentage allocated to private industry.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1170,"content":"<p>Project Ireland 2040 sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to create the Climate Action Fund with an allocation of &euro;500 million for the period 2018 to 2027.

The transport sector,\u00a0which accounts for\u00a0a fifth of Ireland's\u00a0greenhouse emissions annually and which has a heavy reliance on fossil fuel usage,\u00a0has an important role to play in this national decarbonisation effort. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0movement of goods by road\u00a0is the second biggest\u00a0source of\u00a0transport emissions\u00a0after private car use. According to the most recent emissions inventory, heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) alone contributed over 18% of Ireland's total land transport emissions in 2017. Clearly, emissions from the freight sector are difficult to\u00a0address &ndash; HDVs account for only around\u00a05% of vehicles on EU roads but they are responsible for\u00a0some 25% of all EU road transport emissions. Without significant policy action, their emissions trajectory is\u00a0projected to continue to rise by\u00a0almost a fifth\u00a0between 2010 and 2050.\u00a0 This trajectory may be even steeper in Ireland where there has been a steady annual increase in road freight activity levels and the number of additional new goods vehicles being licensed in recent years.\u00a0 Accordingly, developing measures to help address emissions from this sector is critical. <\/p>  <p>  The quickest way to avoid freight emissions is to streamline operations and ensure that vehicle loads and journey routes are optimised.\u00a0 Freight companies are adept at optimising logistical operations and these practices should be encouraged to continue. In tandem, using the most efficient and lowest emitting vehicles is also essential in limiting freight emissions. For this reason, Ireland was very supportive of the introduction of new EU Regulations that set maximum fleet emission averages for new HDVs. New vehicles must emit 15% and 30% less CO2  by 2025 and 2030 respectively relative to average emissions over the period July 2019 to June 2020.\u00a0 Similar legislation has proved to be a very effective approach in other jurisdictions (e.g. Japan, the USA and Canada) and has already been demonstrated to deliver marked emission reductions with cars\/vans in Europe.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As well as making the vehicles more efficient, lower emitting fuels must be employed. Although the Euro VI standard for HDVs represents a considerable improvement over older and more polluting Euro standards, for climate and air quality reasons Ireland must begin to\u00a0move beyond the use of fossil fuels.\u00a0 A range of new alternative fuel solutions are emerging across the fleet spectrum. The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce recently concluded its deliberations on the potential role of alternative fuels, including compressed natural gas (CNG) as a pathway to biomethane, biofuels, and hydrogen in the freight sector. The Taskforce has made recommendations to help accelerate the uptake of alternative fuels and technologies, which are being presented to the Government in advance of Budget 2020.\u00a0 This is especially important as new vehicles entering the fleet\u00a0over the coming years will likely remain in the fleet\u00a0for most or all of the coming decade.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At present there are a number of incentives in place to encourage the uptake of lower emitting alternatives, namely:<\/p>  <p>  - a\u00a0low excise rate for natural gas and biogas for a period of eight years,<\/p>  <p>  - an accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and related equipment,  and<\/p>  <p>  - support for\u00a0the roll-out of refuelling infrastructure for alternative fuels and technologies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition,\u00a0my Department\u00a0is supporting a range of research into\u00a0decarbonising the freight sector.\u00a0 Two freight projects are also approved for funding under the Climate Action Fund.<\/p>  <p>  We are\u00a0focusing our finite resources on supporting the uptake of new lower emitting alternatives.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, more energy, fuel and emissions efficient fossil fueled vehicles should have no purchase price premium\u00a0and lower running costs for operators and, accordingly, should need no incentive from Government to support uptake.\u00a0 Accordingly, I have no immediate plans to introduce a grant or capital allowance scheme to assist road haulage companies to\u00a0buy new diesel vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100079#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety Authority","counter":1206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100079#WRV05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1207,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[39282\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100079#WRV05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be reviewed;

This was achieved through bye-laws enacted under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.\u00a0 It is under this Act that local authorities can choose, using bye-laws,\u00a0to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward.\u00a0 These bye-laws allow relevant local authorities to set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 DCC became aware that - specifically in relation to Dublin - this\u00a0legal basis for making\u00a0such bye-laws could be uncertain, as the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 had vested the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is\u00a0the successor. <\/p>  <p>  My Department examined\u00a0this issue and, following\u00a0legal advice, is now of the view that\u00a0the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 remain in force and preclude DCC from enacting the relevant bye-laws.\u00a0 Also, it seems that a simple\u00a0repeal of the Victorian legislation alone may not be sufficient to enable\u00a0DCC to enact bye-laws for horse-drawn carriages.\u00a0 Therefore, my Department is now working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to identify how best to empower DCC to regulate this area.<\/p>  <p>  Animal Welfare issues are a matter for my colleague, the Minister\u00a0for Agriculture and Food.\u00a0However, I note that the Control of Horses Act 1996 allows local authorities to introduce bye-laws designating certain areas as control areas for horses. Dublin City Council has designated its administrative boundaries as such a control area under its Control of Horses Bye-Laws 2014. These bye-laws require horses to be licensed and set minimum standards for the keeping of horses within the control area. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regulations for horse-drawn carriages for hire or reward should be aligned with any horse welfare obligations imposed by local authorities. Accordingly, I am of the view that horse-drawn carriages for hire and reward should be regulated by local authorities and not the National Transport Authority, which has neither competency for nor experience of animal welfare issues. \u00a0My Department&rsquo;s efforts are therefore centred on enabling Dublin City Council to regulate this area in Dublin just as other local authorities regulate this area elsewhere in the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100081#WRX05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Transport Services Provision","counter":1315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100081#WRX05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1316,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[39722\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100081#WRX05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the evaluation of the provision of a LocalLink service from Bailieborough, Virginia, Ballyjamesduff and Cavan towns; his plans to ensure such a service is implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1317,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.<\/p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services nationally.

My Department has also provided capital funding every year to increase capacity in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The figures presented in the question were provided in response to Parliamentary Question No. 227 and 228 of 19 September 2019. Currently, data on the impact of compliance visits are not recorded at the level of individual children; instead, this information is recorded on a service level and contract level. It is therefore not\u00a0possible to provide an answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question relating to the overclaims identified to\u00a0children registered . However, two important factors are important to note.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, compliance visits should not result in children attending services and accessing subsidies being refused subsidies or services. The DCYA continues to pay services for children who are in attendance. In fact, the increased compliance may see the attendance of children increase. As stated earlier, twice as many children are being subsidised now as were subsidised 4-5 years ago. Twice as many childcare places exist, and the average childcare service has grown from 33 places in 2014 to 47 in 2019. I would also note that the new IT system built to support the National Childcare Scheme will facilitate a greater level of insight into changes in the sector and compliance outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  The rules of the Department&rsquo;s\u00a0early learning and care and school age childcare programmes\u00a0are very clear: subsidies are paid based on patterns of child attendance. That said, it should be emphasised that Pobal, when determining a pattern of attendance during a compliance visit, aim to apply the rules in a manner which maximises the subsidy available to the child.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The attendance rules of the new National Childcare Scheme will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a further degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work to support providers who deliver the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes. The increased investment in recent years should have assisted sustainability significantly. The &euro;19.4m annual Programme Support Payment recognises the additional time required of providers to complete the administrative work associated with childcare programmes\u00a0funded by the Department. Compliance visits are critical to protect the Exchequer and ensure that finite resources for children and families are used to support as many children as possible. Any service which experiences financial difficulty following a compliance visit is encouraged to access available supports through Pobal's Case Management service and through their local City\/County Childcare Committee to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100083#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care","counter":1401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100083#WRZ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1402,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[39422\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100083#WRZ02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the provisions in place for community care homes in County Kilkenny facing a deficit in 2019.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1403,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[39423\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100083#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if community care homes are part of Sl&aacute;inte care.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1404,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[39424\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100083#WRZ02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to set up a national fund to help community care homes with the cost of improvements and upgrades as a result of HIQA visits.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1405,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 551 to 553, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs responsibility for community care homes does not fall under my remit.

Whilst primarily an early education initiative, the ECCE scheme is estimated to save parents using early learning and care services approximately &euro;5000 per child, over the course of the two years.\u00a0<\/p><p>A range of measures I have taken have increased capacity in the sector. These include annual capital grants to increase the number of early learning and care and school age childcare places. The numbers of places has doubled since 2014.\u00a0 A number of other initiatives have seen investment in services to assist them in covering their overhead costs and not having to pass these on to parents. For example, a 7% increase in the ECCE capitation in September 2017, and &euro;19.4m in Programme Support Payments annually to service owners to acknowledge the administrative workload associated with Government schemes.<\/p><p>Through the National Childcare Scheme and a range of other measures, I am committed to changing Ireland&rsquo;s childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the very best. In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible.<\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to make work pay for parents.\u00a0<\/p><p>By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p><p>The Scheme has already been enhanced to expand the benefits for working families.

Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care due to high staff turnover levels impacts directly on quality, and low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care practitioners has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better child outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 4 budgets the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare services has increased by 117%. The level of investment needs to continue to rise if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. Under the terms of industrial relations legislation, for the process of establishing a Sectoral Employment Order to begin, the bodies starting the process must satisfy the Labour Court that they are \"substantially representative\" of either the workers or the employers in the sector. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will readily co-operate with a Sectoral Employment Order process when it is under way. <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions. These include a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.<\/p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, which contains a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan. This Plan, work on which began recently, will identify measures to ensure appropriate numbers of early learning and care and school-age childcare staff at all levels in the sector, to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028, and to raise the profile of careers in the sector. As part of this work, a series of public consultations will be carried out involving those working in the sector and other stakeholders. Plans for the consultation process will be finalised in the coming weeks. First 5 also commits to develop a new funding model for the sector, which may open up new mechanisms to influence pay and conditions in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[39598\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of staff employed by her Department that earn less than the living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour.","asker":"1327","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, any adjustments to the salaries of public and civil servants are set out in the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018-2020.<\/p><p>A suggested living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour would equate to an annual salary of &euro;27,758.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Based on a standard civil service working week of\u00a043.25 hours, there are currently 24 staff employed in my Department in this category. <\/p><p>Details of the application of adjustments to civil service pay in accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 are available on www.circulars.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Data","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[39723\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of social workers employed by Tusla in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of agency staff hired as social workers; the amount spent on staff and agency staff, respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>I wish to advise that my Officials have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Data","counter":1449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1450,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[39724\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100084#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the length of time each of the 37 cr&eacute;ches deemed as critical by Tusla have been classed as such; the length of time each of these cr&eacute;ches has been working its way through the regulation process, from inspection stage through to national registration panel and onto enforcement stage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1451,"content":"<p>There are approximately 4,500 Tusla registered early learning and care and school-age childcare services operating in Ireland.

The pyrite remediation scheme was first adopted in February 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, e.g. such as pyrite in concrete blocks.  <\/p>  <p>  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;2.2 million was provided to the Housing Agency in 2014 to meet expenditure incurred under the scheme in respect of design work, contractors, expenses to homeowners, operational costs, and the administrative costs to the Housing Agency. The remediation of 5 dwellings was completed in the final quarter of that year.<\/p>  <p>  An additional sum of &euro;10 million was made available in Budget 2015 to fund the operation of the scheme in 2015, when a further 148 dwellings had remedial works completed under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;26.6 million was provided for the scheme in 2016. Some 400 dwellings were remediated under the scheme in 2016 giving an aggregate total of 553 dwellings completed since the scheme was first introduced.<\/p>  <p>   In 2017, some &euro;25 million was provided, facilitating the remediation of some 400 additional dwellings, giving an aggregate total of 945 dwellings completed from when the scheme was first introduced up to the end of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2018. This allocation facilitated the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings in 2018 giving an aggregate total of 1,378 dwellings completed since the scheme was first introduced in February 2014. The total allocation was expended in each of the years 2014 to 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that 2,473 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme. Of these, 2,003 dwellings have been included in the scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.  A further 87 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 219 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 164 applications under the scheme were not successful.<\/p>  <p>   Of the 2,003 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme: 55 are at remedial works planning stage, 7 are at tender \/ tender analysis, 247 are under remediation, and 1,694 are complete.<\/p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;32 million is available to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year, of which &euro;22 million has been drawn down by the Housing Agency to date.

It was first confirmed in the wild in Ireland in July 2019. The first two records came from rabbits &ndash; one in Wicklow, the other in Clare. The first report from an Irish hare came on the 9th August &ndash; an animal found dying in the Wexford Slobs Nature Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  Since these initial incidents, a request for public involvement has led to more than 50 reports of dead rabbits and hares around the country. Each report has been followed up by the local NPWS ranger. From these incidents the disease has now been confirmed from six different counties &ndash; Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford. <\/p>  <p>  A post mortem of each dead animal has been carried out by qualified personnel in the regional laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine. Tissue samples have then been sent to DAFM&rsquo;s specialist virology lab in Backweston where the RHD tests take place. I am\u00a0fully satisfied with the objectivity and expertise of the DAFM laboratories. <\/p>  <p>  To date, of the hares tested, two\u00a0have tested positive and one negative for the disease.
