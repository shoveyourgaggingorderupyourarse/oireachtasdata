The challenges posed by a no-deal departure will be particularly acute.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been putting in place the utmost Brexit preparations since even before the outcome of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership became known.  Since then, Budget 2017, Budget 2018 and Budget 2019 have all contained measures to ensure that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring. <\/p>  <p>  These measures continue the process of assuring that Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains competitive and resilient against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty, and include balancing our books; reducing our debt burden; putting in place a major programme of capital investment; establishing the Rainy Day Fund; and broadening the tax base.<\/p>  <p>  Specific initiatives have been introduced aimed at supporting those sectors most affected by Brexit, most notably the Brexit Loan Scheme in Budget 2018 and the Future Growth Loan Scheme in Budget 2019.  The Future Growth Loan Scheme is open to eligible Irish enterprises, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital loans, at least 40% of which is available for food businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and its agencies have also put in place extensive supports and advisory resources to ensure that the sectors likely to be most impacted are prepared for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the Summer Economic Statement set out two budgetary scenarios for Budget 2020, the first involving an orderly departure by the UK from the EU and the second involving a disorderly exit.  Last month the Government decided that the budgetary strategy to be adopted should be based on the latter assumption. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government has already said that it will provide counter-cyclical support to the economy through social protection payments occasioned by higher unemployment and, on the revenue side, lower tax collections which help cushion aggregate demand. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government will also introduce timely, targeted, temporary measures. Brexit contingency support may also be needed to address specific issues in the event of a &lsquo;worst case scenario&rsquo; disorderly Brexit.  I am working with the relevant Ministers on such measures in the context of Budget 2020.<\/p>  <p>  All of these measures form part of a comprehensive response to Brexit across all sectors which has been set out in the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, which was updated in July. This is the second update of the Plan that was originally published in December 2018 and reflects the extensive work that  has taken place to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s management of the economy, however, means that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit from a position of economic strength.  The Irish economy continues to grow at a robust pace and we are close to full employment.  But we do not underestimate the challenges ahead and will be prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100059#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":15,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 66 to 74, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Status","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100059#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[39569\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100059#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the Crossmolina flood relief scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>This important project is now at an advanced stage with detailed design work nearing completion to determine the final design plan for the flood alleviation works.<\/p><p>Hydraulic modelling required for the design of the proposed channel diversion established that there was a need for an in-stream flow control structure to minimise the overall environmental impact on the river system.<\/p><p>Necessary work is now taking place to identify ecological and environmental constraints associated with the in-stream works required for the proposed flow-control structure.

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of the proposals.  <\/p><p>Regarding question 39806\/19, I am advised by Revenue that capital gains tax (CGT) entrepreneur relief applies to an individual who disposes of qualifying assets which have been owned by that individual for a continuous period of at least 3 years in the 5-year period immediately prior to the disposal of the assets. The rate of CGT on such disposals is 10%. <\/p><p>To qualify for CGT entrepreneur relief, the qualifying assets must have been used for the purposes of a qualifying business carried on by the individual disposing of the assets.

are defined as either a period of severe economic downturn or a period during which an unusual event outside the control of the State has a major impact on the financial position of the general government.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund is intended, therefore, to be used as a defined-purpose instrument to address severe events, as opposed to the normal fluctuations within the economic cycle. This approach would align it with the current EU fiscal rules framework, whereby it could be accommodated as an &ldquo;unusual event&rdquo; under the existing Stability and Growth Pact provisions. Withdrawals from the Fund will be transferred directly to the Exchequer so as to support the tax shortfalls and\/or voted expenditure\u00a0to address the specific downturn.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Act deliberately does not describe specific events, such as Brexit or others, so as to\u00a0give\u00a0flexibility to Governments\u00a0to\u00a0withdraw from the Fund\u00a0for all severe downturns,\u00a0many of which are not possible to specify in advance. <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the occurrence of a force majeure event could justify deployment of the Fund.

As I set out in that response, as with other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences such as failure to submit returns or other documentation or the provision of false information. <\/p>  <p>  Section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the imposition of such surcharges for the late payment of Local Property Tax. The challenge of compliance is particularly significant for LPT owing to the nature of the tax itself and the wide demographic liable for the tax, a significant proportion of which are not taxpayers to whom the standard collection and enforcement methods could be applied. Compliance is not just about ensuring the submission of returns and the payment of outstanding tax liabilities; there is also a timing aspect to compliance. \u00a0Returns must be submitted and payments must be made by a specified date(s).\u00a0 The\u00a0suggestion in the Deputy's question,\u00a0of reducing a penalty to nil following the late submission of returns or payments, would only serve to incentivise such late submission. Likewise, as outlined in my previous response, a surcharge is designed to act as a deterrent and, when there is a late compliance, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability: this considered a fair and proportionate deterrent given the size of LPT liabilities. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to comparisons between the treatment of PAYE workers and the self-employed, unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit a return on time. Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to collect LPT liabilities through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension, which is considered to be a fair approach in the context of the surcharge on income tax that can apply to self-employed taxpayers who fail to meet their LPT liabilities.\u00a0 Moreover, all taxpayers who fail to submit an LPT return, or who submit an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.<\/p>  <p>  Adding \u00a0the LPT liability to a self-employed person&rsquo;s income tax liability, as the Deputy suggests, would not, of itself, ensure that the LPT was actually paid. This would not be a similar treatment to a PAYE taxpayer who has no choice about when, or how much of, his or her LPT liability is paid, where deduction at source by the employer or pension provider is made mandatory.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time.

A number of measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the scale of Government expenditure, over &euro;66 billion in aggregate for 2019, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons. This includes in-year policy decisions, timing issues, overspends in particular areas and the need to respond to emerging events where Departments do not have scope to deliver offsetting savings.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at policy decisions that would require a Supplementary Estimate, this would include the decision in relation to this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Christmas Bonus.  Turning to  areas where there are potential pressures that would give rise to overspends, as outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, there are particular challenges in the area of Health taking into account the year-on-year increase and the expenditure profile for the last quarter of the year, and also in Justice arising from pressures in relation to Asylum Seekers Accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the continued uncertainty in relation to the timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union has required that the impacted Departments and Offices incur expenditure to ensure that we are in a position to respond to the emerging position. To the extent that offsetting underspends are not available this would necessitate certain Supplementary Estimates.<\/p>  <p>  At this stage in the year, it is too early to definitively state what the requirement for Supplementary Estimates will be at year-end. The White Paper to be published this Friday will set out the aggregate forecast expenditure outturn for the year taking into account an assessment of potential Supplementary Estimate requirements.   Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment on a Vote Group basis of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Turning to the question of particularly sensitive areas that may require additional resources in the coming year, in light of the current position in relation to the UK's exit from the EU, Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Underlying this decision is the need to ensure the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of the Brexit challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This strategy involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach of providing funding for key public services and also supporting the sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit related disruption. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining sustainable expenditure policy is an important element of meeting our EU obligations in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal policy more generally. This includes ensuring that we are achieving the greatest possible impact with public expenditure and delivering high quality public services in an efficient and effective manner. A range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also just come to the end of year three of this phase of the Spending Review process. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. A number of papers resulting from the review process were published over the summer, with the remainder due to be published alongside the Expenditure Report on Budget Day. <\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, maintaining sustainable expenditure policy has also been crucial in restoring our economy following the economic crisis. Following a period of consolidation, the last number of years have seen moderate, sustainable expenditure growth on an annual basis. The Government has prioritised spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity whilst making incremental and sustainable improvements in public services. The steady growth in expenditure in recent years reflects the significant effort made by this Government to moderate the level of expenditure increases and to secure a sustainable long-term path to growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100064#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[39965\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100064#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which progress continues to be made towards restoration of various cutbacks experienced during the economic crash; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>Following a period of consolidation after the economic crisis, over the last number of years there has been modest growth in expenditure.

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB\u00a0Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department.\u00a0This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.\u00a0\u00a0The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.\u00a0 These schemes\u00a0have been superseded by the more\u00a0extensive capitation grant schemes.\u00a0 The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.\u00a0 It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.\u00a0 This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys\u00a0on the 10th of July\u00a0to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim.

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. <\/p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>This process will recommence in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.<\/p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Services Staff","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH03900"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[39737\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to implement proper pay and working conditions as sought by school secretaries following the recent work stoppage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools. \u00a0I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier\u00a0this year I\u00a0relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school\u00a0secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB\u00a0Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department.\u00a0This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.\u00a0\u00a0The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.\u00a0 These schemes\u00a0have been superseded by the more\u00a0extensive capitation grant schemes.\u00a0 The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.\u00a0 It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.\u00a0 This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys\u00a0on the 10th of July\u00a0to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of\u00a0the survey analysis.\u00a0 In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered unwarranted, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last week. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Department restated to the trade union that their claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys. \u00a0 The Department reiterated its view\u00a0to the union that any industrial action is premature and unwarranted, and called on F&Oacute;RSA to reconsider their action. <\/p>  <p>  As the Union has previously been advised, the Department remains fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA on completion of the survey work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":432,"content":"<p>Question No. 218 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04300"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[39757\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100066#WRH04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for a SNA for a child (details supplied);

A licence is required to import fireworks in any of these categories. <\/p><p>I can further confirm that licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators. <\/p><p>Under Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, it is an offence:<\/p><p>-for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,<\/p><p>-to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and<\/p><p>-to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.<\/p><p>Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 also gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.  <\/p><p>The penalties provided for in connection with these offences are very severe.

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which addresses the rights of children to legal security, to the care of their parents and important adults in their lives, and to equality before the law.\u00a0 The reforms in family law provided for in that Act\u00a0recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.  <\/p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children. Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter. If the father is not married to the mother of the child, he will not automatically become a guardian of the child. The issue of automatic guardianship was considered during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas. However, the automatic extension of guardianship to a father who is not involved and is not participating in his child&rsquo;s life would have consequences for the child and the child&rsquo;s mother, for example, if he does not consent to the issue of a passport or to the placement of a child for adoption. <\/p>  <p>  There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children. Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) now provides for joint guardianship by a man who was not married to the mother of the child and was cohabiting with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months. This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than 3 months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child. In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian.

A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also involved in operational activity where appropriate. The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.<\/p><p>The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is jointly chaired at senior management level by the two police services, to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.  As a multi-agency coordination structure, the Task Force does not have a separate staffing complement or budget. Personnel from the participating agencies in both jurisdictions are assigned for specific operations and other capacities from the relevant agencies are deployed as required by operational demands.<\/p><p>The Task Force has made strong progress in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime. <\/p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, as well as specific joint investigations which take place when individual crime incidents with a cross border dimension occur, such as the one underway into a recent horrific case of abduction and assault. <\/p><p>Last week, together with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, senior officers from all the agencies and senior officials from Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my own Department, I attended the 17th Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co.

Operational members of the Task Force came together at the conference, which provided an opportunity to consider in detail the necessary improvements and innovations, including international co-operation. While the work of the Task Force is reviewed as part of the annual cross border conference on organised crime, there is ongoing multiagency engagement in relation to operations to tackle cross border crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Sector","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL03700"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[39717\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to prohibit the use of sponsorship on children&rsquo;s replica jerseys when that sponsor is a gambling company or promotes gambling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises an interesting issue with regard to sponsors names carried on replica jerseys.

This is an exceptional rate of endorsement. <\/p>  <p>  Over 85% of penalty point offence records are received directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when the offender opts to pay the fixed charge amount and accept the penalty points. The remainder - the minority - are received from the Courts Service, following convictions. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am acutely aware of the road traffic enforcement challenges that result from the non-surrender of driving licences.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of roadside intercept detections, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can record the driving licence details obtained at the point of interception. This can ultimately be used to apply penalty points, should there be a conviction. In such instances, the recording of a licence in court may not be necessary. <\/p>  <p>  However, an issue may still arise where the licence details are not obtained at the point of interception.  For example, in the case of non-intercept speed camera detections, the registration of the vehicle is captured on detection.  If a driver does not pay his\/her Fixed Charge Notice and is subsequently convicted, his\/her licence details should be recorded in Court in accordance with section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016.  Unfortunately, there are instances when the Court is unable to record licence details, for example when licences are reported to the Court as lost or forgotten, or where persons are convicted of speeding while also driving without a licence.  There are also some drivers who wilfully choose not to attend Court and are convicted in absentia. Again, there is no licence to record in these cases. <\/p>  <p>  In cases where a licence is not provided, I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has the facility, in certain instances, to look up the National Vehicle and Driver File and successfully apply penalty points, based on exact matching against the offence's vehicle registration details.<\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority, the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met in August to discuss road traffic enforcement and that the non-production of driving licences was one of the matters discussed at this meeting. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group, chaired by officials from both my Department and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and attended by the Courts Service among other agencies, actively monitors progress and relevant developments in the area of road traffic enforcement. I have asked my officials to meet with Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Courts Service via this forum to discuss how the process of obtaining driver information upon conviction is currently operating under section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016. The Working Group will meet during October and I can confirm to the Deputy that this important enforcement issue will be discussed. I am happy to update the Deputy further after the appropriate meeting has taken place.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Master Licence Record programme, established by Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is implementing further measures to assist in endorsement of penalty points by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF. This project will go some way to addressing the issue of 'unmatched offences' by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF, and, over time, by establishing owner identity for all vehicle records. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Shane Ross, T.D., who has responsibility for road traffic legislation that, due to legislative and operational issues, full population of the Master Licence Record Programme is likely to take several years.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to acknowledge that there will be always be complex scenarios when attempting to endorse driving licences in respect of road traffic offences; for example, instances where the vehicle owner is not driving at the time of an offence, or when an offending vehicle is owned by a company. It is equally important to note that disqualified drivers constitute a major component of those who do not surrender driving licences. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that Minister Ross has proposed the amendment of section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to remove the existing Garda discretion to allow a driver 10 days in which to produce his\/her licence\/learner permit at a Garda station and, as a result, to provide for the mandatory carry of licence\/permit. This proposal will be discussed further over the coming period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":619,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL04900"},{"type":"question","counter":620,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[39783\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100069#WRL05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the development of the new Garda station in Clonmel, County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":621,"content":"<p>The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro;92 million this year.

Complexities may also arise at local level, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply for legal aid to Ennis Law Centre.

This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special reception needs of vulnerable persons.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland\u00a0transposed the Directive by way of the European Communities (Reception\u00a0Conditions) Regulations 2018. While there is no formal procedure in place for vulnerability assessments, Regulation 8 refers to vulnerable persons and provides for\u00a0an assessment in relation to an applicant's special reception needs within 30 days of presentation or application.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Every applicant has an initial interview conducted when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin. If the applicant indicates that they require accommodation , he or she will\u00a0then be assessed for any specific reception needs. The result of the assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the individual.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Applicants are also invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. A Health Screening Team, which is funded and managed by the HSE, is located onsite at the Balseskin Reception Centre for this purpose. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical\/administration support. The team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs\u00a0and makes onward referrals for\u00a0any further treatment required. These health professionals communicate with\u00a0my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS - formerly RIA), within the bounds of patient confidentiality, if a particular need is identified that\u00a0will impact the person's accommodation requirements. In the coming weeks, a new primary care facility will be opening in Balseskin, which will enable the health care team to provide their services in a facility that is to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements are in\u00a0place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer the screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin. Staff from Safetynet liaise with the IPAS if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that special arrangements should be taken regarding the assignment of the person's accommodation, for example if they need to be located near a particular hospital. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continually reviewing how\u00a0to improve services to applicants and my officials are currently examining the options available for putting in place a formal procedure for the identification and assessment of those applicants deemed to be vulnerable in accordance with Article 21 of the Reception Conditions Directive.<\/p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can\u00a0meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes. I\u00a0look forward to the outcome of this research.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that all\u00a0Departments and\u00a0their agencies involved in\u00a0the delivery of services and supports to applicants have a role to play in\u00a0identifying and addressing the needs of applicants who present as vulnerable.

INAB\u00a0was established in 1985. The functions of INAB include the provision of\u00a0accreditation in accordance with the relevant International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 17000 series of standards and guides.<\/p>  <p>  INAB is the sole national accreditation body for Ireland as appointed under EU Regulation 765\/2008. The provision of the accreditation service for Irish enterprises is managed by the INAB executive and over seen by the INAB Board with the support of externally contracted expertise. INAB acts independently in carrying out its accreditation roles.<\/p>  <p>  Following the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in June 2014 INAB became a committee of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA). <\/p>  <p>  The primary nature of contact between Departmental officials and INAB officials is related to the appointment of Notified Bodies. My Department is the\u00a0Notifying Authority for the conformity assessment of certain products being placed on the EU internal market. If a Conformity Assessment Body applies to my Department to be appointed as a Notified Body under certain EU Directives (see attached at Appendix 1) then the Department seeks confirmation from INAB officials that the Conformity Assessment Body has received accreditation from INAB. This arises only in relation to accreditation provided by INAB to a Conformity Assessment Body under a specific number of EU Directives and it is in this context that my Department would seek information from INAB on individual accreditations. <\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the Department has no role in relation to decisions made by INAB as to who should be accredited and\/or how the accreditation process should be conducted by INAB as INAB carries out this role independently. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, officials from my Department have been in regular contact with INAB officials for the last few years in relation to matters concerning accreditation processes in the context of Brexit. INAB officials have participated in a number of publicity events organised by my Department, and other Departments, in order to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on Irish businesses who currently use UK based accreditation services.<\/p>  <p>  Other interactions between officials from my Departments concerning INAB include interaction with the HSA on the financing and staffing of INAB in the context of the overall operational management and staffing of the HSA. <\/p>  <p>  INAB is also a member of the Market Surveillance Forum, an inter-Departmental\/Agency forum, chaired by my Department, involving all the Market Surveillance\u00a0Authorities within the State in addition to other relevant stakeholders, this forum meets on a quarterly basis. <\/p>  <p>  Given the above the Deputy will appreciate it is not possible to account for each individual exchange of correspondence for the period requested by the Deputy in this reply.<\/p>  <p>  However, if the Deputy has a particular topic in mind, my Department will be pleased to assist him. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100070#WRM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[39458\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100070#WRM04600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the correspondence between her Department and the Department of Health in 2018 and to date in 2019.","asker":"1349","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>My Department has regular correspondence with the Department of Health, and all Government Departments, on a variety of issues across the wide range of its remit.\u00a0<\/p><p>In the time available it is not possible to provide details of all such correspondence during the period in question.

I am consistently engaging and listening to the needs of start-ups and established small businesses. <\/p><p>I am keenly aware of their importance as SMEs account for 99.8% of all enterprises in the State and are predominantly indigenous. My Department through its Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), provides a range of tailored supports to small and medium enterprises. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion. <\/p><p>Ireland continues to be very supportive of entrepreneurial activity and once again ranks 1<sup>st<\/sup>in Europe in terms of our entrepreneurs being held in high esteem. The 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor annual index of early stage entrepreneurs indicates that Ireland had increased rates of entrepreneurship in 2018 and holds a position of 5<sup>th<\/sup>in Europe compared to 6<sup>th<\/sup>in 2017. Importantly, also reported is that\u00a0the gap between male and female entrepreneurs has continued to narrow from a previous 2 to 1 ratio to a ratio of\u00a01.6 to 1 in 2018. <\/p><p>While Ireland has a healthy and positive perception of entrepreneurship, I am cognisant of the need to create and support an environment where our budding entrepreneurs can thrive and succeed. <\/p><p>That is why in the 2019 Budget I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices.\u00a0 This extra funding assists our Agencies to reach more of our entrepreneurs and SMEs to help grow and scale their businesses which are at the heart of our economic growth. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) team provides support and advice to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and the potential to export.<\/p><p>The 31 LEOs are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other non-financial supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business. The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.<\/p><p>My Department also runs the www.supportingsmes.gov.ie online portal that enables start-ups and small business to navigate the supports available from all the different government departments, agencies and initiatives. This online tool also advertises upcoming events that would be of interest to entrepreneurs and established SME&rsquo;s such as financial literacy classes or business management workshops. <\/p><p>To further my commitment to the future growth of our indigenous small and medium enterprises, I commissioned the OECD Review of SME Policies in Ireland in March 2018. <\/p><p>The aim of the review is to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to my Department and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. <\/p><p>This is a collaborative body of work and involves considerable input from Government departments, agencies, representative groups and most importantly, indigenous businesses themselves.

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and\u00a0are priced in a cost-effective manner.\u00a0 Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products do occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis, it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new uses of existing medicines representing a significant investment by the HSE\u00a0to provide access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.\u00a0 It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next five years.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100071#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100071#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[39286\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100100071#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for a hospital appointment; the number of persons ahead of them on the list; his plans to invest in the service to improve the waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":702,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HSE advises that this is because there is no evidence that screening would be of any benefit to them. At this stage in life, normal cell changes in the cervix can look very like abnormal cells. If CervicalCheck tested women under 25, changes that are normal might be treated as abnormal and a woman could be sent for treatment when they don't need it. Invasive cervical cancer is also very rare at this age.\u00a0The HSE advises any woman under 25 who is worried about their risk of developing cervical cancer to speak to their GP.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This approach is in line with screening programmes in other countries.\u00a0The UK National Screening Committee recommended in November 2012 that the age of first invitation for cervical screening should be raised to 25 in Wales and Scotland on the basis that there is evidence of a large number of women screened and treated with relatively little benefit below this age. <\/p>  <p>  Cancer screening is one important aspect of cancer prevention, and another is vaccination.
