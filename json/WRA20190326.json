The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth Fishery Harbour Centre. <\/p>  <p>  The Department appointed a firm of Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project.  A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that, while the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that it is classified as &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo;, this classification means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost.  <\/p>  <p>  Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. The Department&rsquo;s view is that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken.  It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.<\/p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. <\/p>  <p>  The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, the consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. The successful tender was commissioned for these works on the 19th of December 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the 2019 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, I have allocated &euro;100,000 for the continuation of the preparatory works for a dredging project in Howth as set out above.

One of the priorities of CAP is to protect grasslands and avoid any downward pressure that would negatively change their use. <\/p><p>In particular farmers are required to comply with the Statutory management requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) provisions, and the agri-environmental measures contained in Rural Development Programmes (RDP). <\/p><p>The greening elements of CAP and GAEC contribute to protecting soil and landscape carbon pools. Temperate grasslands have the potential to sequester carbon, i.e. act as a carbon sink, helping to mitigate rising atmospheric CO<sub>2<\/sub>concentrations, therefore potentially contributing to climate change mitigation.<\/p><p>In addition, measures contained within the RDP-funded Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS), encourage soil management practices that favour carbon sequestration, such as planting of cover crops, tree and minimum tillage practices. For example, almost 26,000 hectares of arable land is planted with catch crops annually which prevents soil erosion and absorbs valuable plant nutrients.  This measure has the capacity to absorb 1.25 million tonnes of nitrogen annually, minimising the need for chemical fertilisers thereby having an environmental and economic benefit.  The carbon sequestration potential of the 5,000 groves of trees planted under GLAS equates to approximately 450 hectares of woodland which is c. 900 tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>annually.<\/p><p>Scientific research also has a central role to play in developing our understanding of the carbon sequestration potential of our natural land resources.

However, following the successful scientific trialling of badger vaccination, research from UCD concluded that the current TB Eradication Programme has the tools available to achieve eradication. <\/p>  <p>  Good progress has been made in reducing the incidence of TB in cattle in recent years. In the year 2000, 10,785 farmers experienced a TB restriction. In contrast, in 2018 there were 3, 874 herds restricted for TB, a 65% decrease on the year 2000 figures. While this historically low level of TB is very much to be welcomed, the work done in UCD tells us that without some additional measures the estimated timeline for eradication is 60 to 90 years.   <\/p>  <p>  The impacts of TB on a farmer are severe, causing financial hardship and emotional stress. This is why it is so important to reduce the numbers of farmers affected and to move to eradicate this disease. For that reason, I directed my officials to establish the TB Stakeholder Forum last year, so that all stakeholders can have a voice in discussing which policy options should be chosen to reduce disease levels and eradicate bovine TB from Ireland. Maintaining the status quo, with the addition of badger vaccination will lead to eradication over a 60-90 year period, but the science from UCD suggests that extra measures that could be applied to the programme can bring about eradication in a much shorter time frame. The forum has been tasked with agreeing measures that can further address disease transmission with the objective of achieving eradication by 2030.

These measures not only focus on the mitigation of greenhouse gases and improving resource efficiency but are also aimed at restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to building resilience of agricultural production systems (i.e. adaptation).<\/p>  <p>  The long term vision for the agricultural sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. Our policy approach is based on three principles:<\/p>  <p>i. reducing agricultural emissions;<\/p>  <p>ii. increasing carbon sequestration and <\/p>  <p>iii. displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials.  <\/p>  <p>  There are already a significant number of measures in place which support these principles. However, I am not complacent on this important issue and my Department continues to review and develop new measures that will realise the ambition for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Production efficiency improvements are a core part of the efforts being undertaken by the agricultural sector.  I recently launched a Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot scheme that builds on the success of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme with a funding provision of &euro;20m in 2019. This new scheme is targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production.  <\/p>  <p>  Sequestration has also a key role to play in reducing the carbon footprint of the sector and &euro;106 million has been made available by my Department in 2018 under the Forestry Programme to support afforestation and other forest initiatives with significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options.<\/p>  <p>  The sector also plays a key role in the supply of biomass materials, adopting energy efficiency measures and renewable technologies on-farm as well as on-site energy generation all of which can provide profitability gains which underpins the sustainable production system as well as contributing to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>  <p>  Higher ambition on environmental and climate action are part of the new CAP, post 2020, and it is proposed that 40% of the overall CAP budget will contribute to climate and environmental action.

In September 2018, officials from my Department visited Cherbourg to discuss the capacity issue with the French authorities and local lairage operators. Last month, Bord Bia met with local lairage operators, while Department officials held a meeting with the IFA and French Embassy representatives. <\/p>  <p>  I also raised the issue last month with the French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian and last week, I discussed the matter with my French counterpart, Didier Guillaume, at the EU Agrifish Council meeting in Brussels.  I should make it clear that the facilitation of the French Ministry relates to the approval of private sector developments.  <\/p>  <p>  Following this engagement, I am happy to report that, in recent weeks, the French authorities have approved an increase of the holding capacity of the Qualivia lairage in Cherbourg. This will provide for additional daily capacity for 400 animals. Based on current ferry sailing schedules, this provides increased capacity of some 1,200 animals per week.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that I will continue to advocate on behalf of our exporters with regard to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600060#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coillte Teoranta","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600060#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[13923\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600060#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on whether it is time to commission an independent review of the Forestry Act 1988, which established Coillte (details supplied); if a review of the legislation will be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>I fully agree with the long-term goal of the decarbonisation of our economy and that sequestration through forestry will be key to achieving this.

In advance of the fourth and most recent session in October 2018, Ecuador circulated the zero draft of a legally binding instrument.   The next session of the Group will meet in October 2019 and Ireland will work with our EU partners to look at how we might actively and constructively engage in the negotiation process, notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which the work of the Group has been conducted to date.  While we are open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty, we believe that all economic operators should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. The draft treaty that has currently been circulated focuses on transnational corporations and it is Ireland's view that any new treaty should cover both companies engaged in purely domestic operations as well as transnational corporations.<\/p>  <p>  We would wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point,  I would note that of the 21 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[12837\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the meetings he had with Mr. Michel Barnier on the weekend of 9 and 10 March 2019; the issues that were discussed on the withdrawal treaty and Brexit in general; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Together with the Taoiseach, I met with Mr Barnier during his private visit to Dublin on 9-10 March.

This continues to be a matter of real concern for the Government. <\/p>  <p>  I wish, first of all, to extend my sincere sympathies and condolences to all of those affected by acts of violence in Colombia so far in 2019. I would like to reiterate that such violence is entirely unacceptable. I would also like to take this opportunity to once again urge the Government of Colombia to ensure that all such violent incidents are thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators brought to justice.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an ongoing commitment to support peace and promote human rights in Colombia, including through the full implementation of the country&rsquo;s peace accord. In our exchanges with the government and official representatives of Colombia, we regularly raise human rights concerns, including the situation of human rights defenders and community leaders. As well as exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level, officials at the Department and at our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; engage regularly with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active across the country.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;14 million in funding to Colombia since 2007, focusing on the areas of human rights, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. The Department provides funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia to support its important work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Historic strides have been made to date in its implementation. However, significant challenges still remain, including in the areas of de-mining, attention to victims, transitional justice, and rural development, some of which of course will have an impact on the situation of political and community activists. Ireland remains a committed partner to the Colombian Government in the peace process, and we will support the Government as it continues its work towards the full implementation of the peace accords, a message we have made clear in our contacts to date with the Government of President Iv&aacute;n Duque.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the organisations mentioned above, my Department also provides funding to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Colombia, which works to support stabilisation in areas affected by the conflict, towards reincorporation of former combatants, and to support victims and systems of transitional justice, including by working to strengthen the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland was also a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and will contribute &euro;3 million over the five-year lifespan of the Fund. The Fund finances projects targeted at the marginalised rural areas of Colombia which have been most affected by conflict, and all projects incorporate a human rights and gender perspective.<\/p>  <p>  As we know from our own experience, peace is the work of decades.  Ireland is committed to supporting the full implementation of the agreement to ensure the eradication of violence in vulnerable communities and a more peaceful and stable future for all Colombians. Having a permanent diplomatic presence on the ground, with the opening of our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; earlier this year, will greatly enhance our ability to meet that commitment, and we will continue to work alongside the Colombian Government and our EU, multilateral and civil society partners towards this goal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE06900"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[12953\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE07000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding reopening the Irish Embassy in Tehran to facilitate future co-operation and trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":256,"content":"<p>The Embassy of Ireland in Ankara is accredited on a non-residential basis to Iran.

Sensitivities relating to development of indigenous lands without sufficient consultation or consent with the local population have been brought to my attention and I remain concerned at reports of unacceptable levels of violence and killings of land rights and indigenous rights activists, often those vocally opposing such projects. <\/p>  <p>  A report released in August 2018 by UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Ms. Victoria Tauli Corpuz, highlights the difficult situation that exists in several countries, including Brazil, for indigenous communities and activists. The report concludes that states carry the primary responsibility for ensuring that indigenous peoples are able to safely exercise their rights and that accountability is established for violations against indigenous communities and defenders. The reports also highlights the necessity to engage in genuine, free and informed consultation with communities prior to development. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has called on a number of occasions for states, including Brazil, to ensure full accountability for any violence, harassment or intimidation of civil society, indigenous or environmental activists exercising their rights to freedom of expression, and for the respect of indigenous communities' rights. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that call.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland used the occasion of the 27th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 5 May 2017 to express our concern at the reported regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in Brazil.  Ireland recommended that Brazil take further steps to protect human rights defenders, including those working in relation to the rights of indigenous peoples, by ensuring impartial, thorough and effective investigations into all cases of attacks, harassment and intimidation and the prosecution of all alleged perpetrators of such offences.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these representations at multilateral level, officials of my Department at home and at our Embassy in Bras&iacute;lia engage regularly with human rights activists and civil society leaders in Latin America, including those working on the rights of indigenous communities. <\/p>  <p>  I take note of President Bolsonaro's decision to keep Brazil in the Paris Agreement, which is an encouraging development. Ireland is a committed supporter of global efforts to combat climate change, one of the most serious threats facing the world today, and Brazil has been an important partner on this issue. Brazil played a key role in the formation of the Paris Agreement of 2015, and this is an indication that President Bolsonaro will honour these commitments. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with Brazil, and other partners in the Latin America and Caribbean region, on the issues of climate change, sustainable development, and indigenous rights through our bilateral, EU level and EU-CELAC relationships.  We will monitor developments closely, and will continue to engage with EU and local partners, raising these issues at EU and UN level as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600062#WRE07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":263,"content":"<p>Question No. 147 answered with Question No. 137.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":265,"content":"<p>Question No. 148 answered with Question No. 137.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":266,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 149 and 150 answered with Question No. 142.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":267,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 151 to 155, inclusive, answered with Question No. 137.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600063#WRF01000"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[13259\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600063#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated full-year cost if the budget for the reconciliation fund increased by 10%.

The European Union recognises that conditions in Libyan detention centres are a matter of great concern and this informs the approach taken in designing programmes funded through the EU Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF). <\/p>  <p>  The EU is providing support to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, including with primary medical assistance. The focus of EUTF-funded actions in detention centres run by the Libyan Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) is two-fold: improving conditions for detainees and assisting detainees with voluntary humanitarian repatriation to their countries of origin. The EUTF is supporting the provision of emergency medical and life-saving services to detained migrants, including psycho-social support. Support is provided for improving sanitary and hygiene conditions, such as by the provision of toilets, showers, storage\/distribution capacity for drinking water and sewerage systems, and for the distribution of essential non-food items to detainees. Importantly, the EUTF also supports the provision of human rights and protection training for detention centre personnel.<\/p>  <p>  Country-level programming for a total of &euro;282 million has been approved to date for Libya. The EU is actively working to provide protection, assistance and alternatives to migrants, refugees, internally displaced people and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings. All projects are implemented by international partners on the ground, such as UN agencies or EU Member States. For example, almost 90,000 refugees and vulnerable migrants have received medical assistance through EUTF programming. Health care centres, clinics, schools and electrical substations have been rehabilitated or equipped. Because the system of arbitrary detention in Libya must be brought to an end, the EU does not provide food assistance in a systematic manner inside detention centres. The EU is firmly opposed to the institutionalisation of the detention system.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatives to detention centres need to be established, in particular for vulnerable migrants, and Ireland has called on the Libyan authorities to continue to work with the relevant international organisations to make this possible. In the shorter term, oversight in detention centres needs to be vastly expanded and improved. All parties, including those with de facto control of territory, have a responsibility to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate UN and other humanitarian access to detention centres. However, continued efforts are required to bring an end to the unacceptable conditions migrants and refugees face in Libya.<\/p>  <p>  During the last year, some progress has been made in alleviating the plight of migrants in Libya. In late 2017, the EU stepped up its cooperation with UN agencies and the African Union to accelerate returns from Libya for those migrants who wish to leave, and to establish safe and legal pathways to resettle those who need international protection. This has contributed to the voluntary return of more than 37,000 vulnerable migrants. In early March, the UNHCR carried out its third evacuation of refugees out of Libya this year, bringing the total of those evacuated to over 3,300. <\/p>  <p>  Support to the Libyan Coast Guard through the EUTF is included in the &euro;91.3 million programme of Support to Integrated Border and Migration Management, the first phase of which was adopted in July 2017 and the second in December 2018. This programme provides training, including on human rights, and equipment, notably communication and rescue equipment, as well as developing institutional capacity. The programme also aims to ensure that the Libyan authorities comply with human rights standards in Search and Rescue operations. Ireland shares the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR&rsquo;s assessment that Libya is not a safe third country. It is for this reason that it is not EU policy to send people back to Libya, but rather to disrupt the business model of migrant smugglers or traffickers, so as to prevent further loss of life in the Mediterranean. <\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to end these abuses. There is a governance vacuum in many areas of the country, and access for international organisations seeking to monitor and alleviate conditions for migrants is restricted in many areas, including in detention centres. Bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning and unified government. The EU will continue to work with the UN and others to support and reinforce Libya's sovereign institutions.<\/p>  <p>  While Libya is the epicentre of this crisis, a long-term solution will require further cooperation from states all along migration routes, and the support of regional partners and the international community. Work to reduce poverty in countries of origin, which is one of the main drivers of irregular migratory flows, is at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Staff","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[14164\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the recruitment process for new customs officials.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>In September 2018, the Government granted approval in principle for the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.\u00a0 Budget 2019 provided Revenue with the funding needed for 270 of the additional 600 staff to be recruited during 2019 to manage an orderly UK withdrawal. <\/p>  <p>  Following a Government decision to give greater priority to the preparations for a No Deal Brexit in December 2018, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment plans.

No.2 of 1923), Revenue has statutory responsibility for the performance of its functions and is independent in dealing with the tax affairs of any individual under tax and customs legislation. Section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 2011 gives legal effect to Revenue&rsquo;s independence in the performance of its functions. As set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 173, Revenue&rsquo;s treatment of any individual is subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Ombudsman. Revenue&rsquo;s Chairman is the Accounting Officer and Head of Office under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, (PSMA) and in accordance with PSMA, Revenue reports annually on its Statement of Strategy to me as Minister for Finance. Revenue submits end of year accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General within three months of the end of every financial year. As Accounting Officer, and in accordance with section 10 PSMA, the Chairman appears before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with issues arising from Reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General and other matters relating to Revenue activities that the Committee may wish to discuss.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s Chairman and Revenue officials regularly appear as witnesses before other Oireachtas Committees such as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Taoiseach, and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, on matters relating to Revenue activities. Furthermore, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act, 2013, in respect of the exercise by either or both Houses of the Oireachtas (or by a Committee of either House or both Houses) of a power to conduct an inquiry into specified matters, including the provisions for matters relating to compellability, apply to Revenue. <\/p><p>In relation to the overall administration of the taxation and customs systems, Revenue is accountable to me as Minister for Finance. As regards parliamentary oversight, I present Revenue-related legislation to the Oireachtas; lay Revenue&rsquo;s Annual Report and accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas; present estimates for Revenue expenditure in the D&aacute;il and present Revenue&rsquo;s views, positions and observations on proposals to Cabinet. Tax policy is the responsibility of my Department and my officials work closely with Revenue officials on related issues. I have already said in reply to the earlier Parliamentary Question referred to above that I do not see a need for further identification of vulnerable persons in the tax code. However, as I also said in my reply to the earlier question, I am advised by Revenue that if the Deputy has identified a specific group of vulnerable taxpayers whose needs are not met by existing services, Revenue&rsquo;s customer services team would be happy to engage with him to identify scope for further improvement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[12839\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will request the Revenue Commissioners to provide the number of suspicious transaction reports it receives from financial institutions in the Dublin region in each of the past ten years; if this type of information could be extracted and used in a public campaign run by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank to prevent unsuspecting members of the public from being defrauded through various types of scams; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[12842\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of suspicious reports received in each of the years 2014 to 2018 from all competent organisations in each tax region as stipulated under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Funding) Act 2010; the way in which these reports are assessed; the number that lead to prosecutions and-or the collection of unpaid taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.<\/p><p>I am advised that designated bodies are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) to the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S?och&aacute;na where they have a suspicion that a money laundering offence may have been committed.

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector. However it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated, resulting in a situation in which elements in the industry and certain agents aggressively pursued zero rating of all kinds of products, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover, build muscle and reduce stress. These businesses consistently challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products giving rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The industry&rsquo;s representative body, the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), raised concerns with Revenue about the difficulties in distinguishing between food supplement products which could be zero rated and those which should be standard rated. In response to the issues raised by the IHTA, Revenue undertook a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements and engaged an expert to advise on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010. Based on the expert advice and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. I decided not to introduce any legislative changes at that time but as the Deputy may be aware I have committed to putting in place a consultation process to help me identify the policy options in relation to VAT on food supplements and will publish the conclusions in the Tax Strategy Papers later this year. I envisage seeking input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, to ensure that any legislative changes I bring forward are evidence based, and I will consult with my colleague the Minister for Health in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Details on the public consultation will be announced shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600064#WRG05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Audits","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[12949\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an audit by the Revenue Commissioners of a person (details supplied) will be reviewed; if the process will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>Revenue has advised me that the person in question was the subject of a compliance intervention in respect of their 2016 tax liabilities.

These are:<\/p>  <p>  - rent payable on the property by the person chargeable,<\/p>  <p>  - rates payable on the property by the person chargeable (either in accordance with the terms of a lease or as an expense of the agreement under which the rent\/receipts were received),<\/p>  <p>  - the cost of goods provided and services rendered by the person chargeable in relation to the letting of the property (where such person is either legally bound under the lease to provide such goods and services or the provision of such goods and services constitute an expense of the agreement under which the rent\/receipts were received),<\/p>  <p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the premises borne by the person chargeable and which constitute an expense of the agreement under which the rent\/receipts were received, but excluding any capital expenditure,<\/p>  <p>  - interest on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair the premises.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, any VAT incurred on the purchase of a premises is not deductible under section 97(2) TCA against rental income from the premises, for either income tax or corporation tax purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  I would add that where a person, not being a property developer, has incurred VAT on the conversion of a property that is to be let as residential accommodation in a special regeneration area under the Living City Initiative scheme (Chapter 13 of Part 10 TCA refers), capital allowances will be available on the VAT inclusive eligible expenditure, provided the terms and conditions of that scheme have been met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Building Finance Ireland Remit","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[12988\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to task Home Building Finance Ireland with an expanded remit to issue loans to owner management companies to cover remedial building costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>In the first instance I would like to acknowledge the stressful circumstances which the owners and residents of buildings face when defects occur in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  HBFI was established late last year as a supply based measure to help address as shortage of new housing in the State.

Thus, for example, in the case of a person in receipt of a State pension and a private pension, an increase of &euro;5 per week in the State pension could mean that tax on an additional &euro;260 would have to be collected over the course of the year by reducing the person&rsquo;s tax credits in relation to the private pension.  &euro;260 extra income at the standard rate of income tax of 20% gives rise to a reduction in tax credits of &euro;52 for the year or &euro;4.34 per month.

In the case of higher rate taxpayers, the amount retained would represent almost 60% of the weekly increase. <\/p>  <p>  However, in the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to what assistance is provided generally to State pensioners in the income tax system, I would draw his attention to section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in particular.

An IREF is an investment fund that derives 25% or more of its value from Irish real estate. As an investment undertaking, the profits or gains of the IREF are not taxed within the fund, but instead are subject to tax in the hands of the investors. As a result information on net rental profits or capital gains from property within IREFs is not available as distributions of value (generally comprised of accrued income and\/or gains) are the reference point for taxation.<\/p>  <p>  Where an investor receives value from the IREF, an IREF withholding tax of 20% will generally apply. There are a number of classes of investor that are exempt from the operation of this withholding tax, such as pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.  Investors who own less than 10% of the IREF can make a claim for a repayment of dividend withholding tax if they are entitled to a lower rate of withholding tax under a double tax agreement. <\/p>  <p>  IREFs are required to declare and pay this withholding tax on an annual basis and I am advised by Revenue that the first return and payment of IREF withholding tax was due 30 July 2018 where a fund had an accounting period that ended in the second half of 2017. The amount of IREF withholding tax collected on the distribution of profits by relevant IREFs was in the region of &euro;9m for this period. The data collected by Revenue relates to the distributions paid out of the funds. It is important to note that any profits which remain within the fund will be subject to tax when they are eventually distributed to investors. Returns were due to Revenue in January in respect of funds with accounting periods ending in the six months to July of 2018, these returns are currently being processed and information will be available in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  The rules relating to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland are found in Part 25A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and were introduced by Finance Act 2013. In order to be a REIT, a company must be listed on the main market of an EU stock exchange within three years of forming, and it must be widely held. Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. As such, their income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits and gains to their shareholders each year. A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other business (i.e. non-property business) that it carries on.  <\/p>  <p>  Dividend withholding tax at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.  Investors can make a claim for a repayment of dividend withholding tax if they are entitled to a lower rate of withholding tax under a double tax agreement. I am advised by Revenue that net  dividend withholding tax amounting to &euro;11.8 million in 2017 and &euro;12.4 million in 2018 was collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs.  <\/p>  <p>  As REITs are not subject to Corporation Tax on their Irish property profits or gains, there is no obligation to report these amounts to Revenue. Revenue has also confirmed that, due to the small number of REITs involved and its obligation to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information, it cannot provide specific information in relation to the income or capital gains associated with these entities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[13343\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider appropriate actions to curb the competitive advantage that IREFs and REITs have through their tax neutral or minimal tax status in view of recent comments in the media (details supplied).","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[13344\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has conducted a detailed analysis of the proportion of property here held in REITs and IREFs which have tax neutral status due to EEA pension funds owning shares in the property funds.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.   <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[13397\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600065#WRH05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of customers impacted by the failure of a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>Qudos Insurance A\/S (Qudos) was authorised and prudentially regulated by the Danish Financial Services Authority (DFSA).

Where no consideration is given by the child for the loan (i.e. interest-free loan), or where any consideration given is less than an amount related to the open market interest rate, the annual value of the loan to the child may be treated as a taxable gift. The value of the loan is determined under section 40 Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 2003 as &ldquo;the best price obtainable in the open market&rdquo; for the use of the loaned money. The current best financial institution interest rate at the end of each year for which the loan is outstanding is used to determine the best price obtainable in the open market. <\/p><p>However, if the annual value of the free use of a loan is less than &euro;3,000 (known as the &lsquo;small gift&rsquo; exemption), the gift each year is exempt from gift tax provided the child has received no other gifts in the same year from the same parent.  If this annual value exceeds &euro;3,000 then only the excess amount each year is treated as a taxable gift. However, gift tax only becomes payable when the total value of all taxable gifts and inheritances taken by the child from his or her parents exceeds the Group A tax-free threshold which is currently &euro;320,000. A tax rate of 33% applies above this threshold. <\/p><p>As there is no fixed statutory rate of interest for gift tax purposes, but a rate that varies automatically with current market rates, the matter of consultation with the Department of Finance about the annual rate used does not arise. There is no basis, therefore for proposing the application of a statutory rate of interest. <\/p><p>I am also informed by Revenue that the amount of benefit-in-kind to be charged to income tax (under section 122 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) where loans at preferential rates of interest are made by employers to their employees is determined by a fixed statutory rate of interest that is adjusted from time to time by way of the Finance Act.  While, the standard such rate is currently 13&frac12;%, a lower rate of 4% applies in the case of home mortgage loans. An employee in receipt of a preferential loan is charged to income tax on the difference between the amount of interest that would have been payable on the preferential loan if interest had been paid at the fixed statutory rate and the amount of interest, if any, actually paid on the loan.<\/p><p>Where the employer and employee are related and the preferential loan is made in a personal capacity from personal resources, the benefit-in-kind provisions are not applied. However, depending on the value of the loan made, the prevailing market interest rate and the applicable tax-free group threshold, gift tax may be payable.<\/p><p>The tax code currently allows for the making of interest-free loans between parents and their children subject to a potential liability to gift tax. As with most taxes, gift tax operates on a self-assessment basis subject to Revenue compliance checks and audit. Where Revenue identifies arrangements that are not in accordance with the relevant legislation it takes appropriate corrective action. <\/p><p>In relation to Question 13551\/19, I am informed by Revenue that an estimate of the value of assets transferred as inheritances from Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) returns is shown in table 2 in the following at link<b><\/b><i>.<\/i>Revenue has also advised me that the published figure for 2017 is now updated to &euro;3.6 billion and a tentative estimate for 2018 is &euro;4.4 billion.<\/p><p>The Central Bank publishes data on household wealth at an aggregate rather than an individual level in the Quarterly Financial Accounts the most recent being for Q3 2018 <i><\/i><\/p><p>No comparison between the Central Bank data and CAT returns is available.  <\/p><p>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) conducted the first Household Finance &amp;amp; Consumption Survey (HFCS) in 2013. While a comparison of the value of assets as indicated in the survey against CAT returns is not available, the Revenue report at the above link (page 8) includes a comparison of the number of CAT returns to the number of (indicated) inheritances and gifts.<\/p><p>Overall, the analysis of the HFCS suggests that there are more gift or inheritance transactions occurring than reported in returns filed with Revenue. However, the difference is likely to be explained by the majority of these transactions not being liable to CAT due to the various reliefs and exemptions that are available in respect of the tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600066#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Interdepartmental Working Groups","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600066#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[13566\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600066#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the working groups currently established in his Department; the focus of their work; the membership composition of each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":417,"content":"<p>Within my Department there are a number of Departmental and inter-Departmental Working Groups, working on a range of issues.

businesses and community development bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>In his contribution to the D&aacute;il debate on a Fianna F&aacute;il insurance motion of 13 March last the Deputy  raised 4 issues, &ndash; namely, matters regarding the National Claims Information Database (NCID), notifying policyholders of claims made against them, updating the Book of Quantum, and setting up a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit. In responding to the Deputy's question I propose to take each of these four issues in turn.<\/p>  <p>  National Claims Information Database (NCID): I can confirm that the NCID will be fully operational soon and later this year it is expected that the first report will be made.  While it is important that the database initially focuses on private motor insurance, the relevant underpinning legislation &ndash; the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 &ndash; allows for the scope of the database to be expanded to other types of insurance.  In this regard, a recommendation was made in the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance for the Central Bank to conduct an analysis on the feasibility and merit of extending the NCID to employer and public liability insurance.  It is considered that the second half of 2019 is the most appropriate time to expect the Central Bank to have completed this task.<\/p>  <p>  Notification of policyholders of claims made against them:  the CIWG agrees that insurance companies ought to notify policyholders of claims made before settlement, the amount a claim was settled for, and the reasons why the claim was settled. Accordingly, this exact issue forms the basis of Recommendation 10 in the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  In addition, a similar recommendation in respect of motor insurance policyholders has been included in the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  Having been unable to reach agreement with Insurance Ireland on a new set of guidelines based on those drawn up by IBEC and the Irish Insurance Federation in 2004, my Department is currently considering the merits of addressing this issue through primary legislation, specifically by an amendment to a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on Consumer Insurance Contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Book of Quantum, the Fianna F&aacute;il motion of 13 March called for the immediate commencement of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 in order to require PIAB to update the Book of Quantum at least every three years.  I understand from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation that it is intended the Act will take effect from 3 April 2019.  However, it should be borne in mind that the Book merely reflects the prevailing levels of compensation for various types of injury based upon what has actually been paid out in the Courts, by the State Claims Agency,  or awarded by PIAB.  Currently, therefore, the only way that the award levels in the Book can be lowered is if there is first a decrease in the actual level of awards paid out. In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) has proposed that this reduction be achieved by the Judicial Council compiling a recalibrated set of guidelines for various types of personal injury, which would in effect replace the Book of Quantum.  Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy has made it clear that bringing the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is his primary objective, and has been exploring a number of options in attempting to reach this target.  In this regard, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has engaged with his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan, and he has been informed that the Judicial Council Bill is to be prioritised with a view to having this legislation in place as soon as possible to allow for the establishment of the Judicial Council. <\/p>  <p>  Garda Insurance Fraud Unit: the CIWG&rsquo;s latest Progress Update confirms that the Garda Commissioner has undertaken to further consider the establishment of an insurance fraud investigation unit within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB).  In response to the original proposal to explore the possibility that a specific unit be set up within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using funding from the insurance industry, the Commissioner indicated his preference that, in principle, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be funded by any source other than the Exchequer for the purposes of tackling insurance fraud.  The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of resources within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and neither I, nor Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, nor the Minister for Justice and Equality has a role in such operational matters.  Nevertheless, Minister D&rsquo;Arcy remains committed to pursuing this matter, and is hopeful that there will be improved investigative capacity in place in this area shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600066#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600066#WRJ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[13709\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600066#WRJ04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the up-to-date statistics for the number of businesses that have applied for the key customs registration, the economic operators registration and identification number will be provided; the number of Irish businesses with such a registration now; the turnaround time for the Revenue Commissioners to process a registration application; the number of Irish businesses the Revenue Commissioners estimate will require such a registration in the course of their normal business after 29 March 2019 in the event of a disorderly Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that there has been a significant increase in registrations for Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) numbers year on year.

I am assuming that the Deputy, when referring to solid fuel smuggling, is enquiring about the movement of solid fuel into the State from Northern Ireland in the context of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT). SFCT is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to solid fuel movements into the State from Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Where a supplier makes a supply in the State of a quantity of solid fuel, the supply is subject to SFCT and the supplier is accountable for and must pay the tax to Revenue. Where an individual purchases solid fuel from a supplier in another Member State and brings it into the State a SFCT liability does not arise, provided the fuel is for their own private use and they accompany it into the State. If, however, such an individual supplies another person in the State with the fuel, they will have made a first supply and will be liable to account for and pay SFCT.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border controls in relation to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States. Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel entering the State from Northern Ireland. Similarly, the transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession. <\/p>  <p>  SFCT is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis.  Fuel suppliers must, on a bi-monthly basis, file a return for all first supplies of coal and peat made in the State during the period. They have one month following the end of each SFCT accounting period to file their return and pay the tax due. SFCT law is enforced by Revenue using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.  This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.  I am advised that to date, Revenue has undertaken actions to enforce approximately &euro;640,000 of solid fuel carbon tax. <\/p>  <p>  As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, because of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection by Revenue of SFCT is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.

The reduction would not exceed the amount of additional expenditure actually incurred. The Bill deliberately does not describe such an event in greater detail than &ldquo;a natural or other disaster&rdquo;. This is because it is intended to refer to the type of events which are unpredictable and create an immediate cost. <\/p>  <p>  I envision this contingency being activated if, for example, there is an exceptionally severe weather event causing enormous damage, or a major health or disease risk such as a significant outbreak of a contagious disease. This facility is not intended to substitute for prudent contingency budgeting by public authorities &ndash; it is only for events that are inherently exceptional, or exceptionally repeated in a given year. That might arise if there are repeated storms, for example. If this facility is used, any payment made will be directly from the Exchequer under the normal public financial procedures. In addition, the Minister for Finance will make a report to this House, in accordance with Section 5, subsection 7, as to the reasons for reducing the payment being made into the Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill the proposed &ldquo;Rainy Day Fund&rdquo; can be drawn on contingent on Government and Oireachtas approval being received for one of the criteria set out under section 9(2) of the Bill. Brexit is not in itself an exceptional contingency as it has been confirmed since 2016 and it has been at the core of policy making during that time. There are obvious external risks to the Irish economy including Brexit but these are known risks for which we are undertaking extensive preparedness planning, including for a no deal scenario. The Government has worked hard at national and European level to build support for Irish positions and the Government's budgetary policies have worked to ensure fiscal resilience and a balanced tax base. We are now in a far better position to weather the storm when a future crisis hits. Setting reserves aside now through the Rainy Day Fund will further strengthen our position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600067#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licence Fees","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600067#WRK01800"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[14149\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600067#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be generated if the cost of renewal of a retailer off-licence increased from &euro;500 to &euro;700; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the table below includes the total number of Retailers Off Licences issued during 2018, broken down by licence type.

This means that pay increases, agreed as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA), are to be passed on to qualifying pensions of pre-existing public service pension scheme members, to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary of those still serving after the pay increases are applied. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, not all pension recipients will be due increases. If the salary on which the pension is based is lower than that of a serving staff member in the same grade and on the same scale point, then no increase will be due. For example, protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation meant that their pensions were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts. If the current salaries of serving staff in the same grade and on the same scale point are not yet greater than those higher pay rates used in the pension calculation, even after the relevant pay increases under the PSSA have been applied to serving staff, no pension increase will be due. The same is true of any pensions that commenced prior to the FEMPI legislation that are linked to pay rates that have not yet been exceeded by the current salary rates of the relevant serving public service cohorts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600068#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Status","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600068#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[13254\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600068#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the Enniscorthy flood defence scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>The River Slaney (Enniscorthy) Flood Relief Scheme is at an advanced stage of planning and design.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.<\/p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. <\/p><p>Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. <\/p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website <i>www.ncse.ie.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>Schools are advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019.  An appeal can be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Additional special education teaching allocations will be made for schools who have increased enrolments to the extent that they achieve developing status, once school enrolments have been verified at October 2019, as opposed to being based on projected enrolments. As the actual enrolments must be taken account of, this process cannot take place until the new school year is underway.<\/p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>As revised updated allocations have recently been issued to schools, this process will recommence in September 2019. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.<\/p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.<\/p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.<\/p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. <\/p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN02200"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[12976\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a school (details supplied) on the NCTE critical list; the timeframe expected before this school will be offered appropriate broadband services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>The policy of the Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints. Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. <\/p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2017 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools and to date, drawdowns from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,400 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity. This represents more than one third of all primary schools. This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2019, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, I have asked my officials to review the service and raise this matter with the existing service provider. If the service provided cannot be upgraded under the existing contractual arrangements, my officials will include this school in the next available mini competition. Through this process, and subject to current contractual arrangements, it may be possible to provide improved service to this school, depending on the locally available infrastructure. The Schools Broadband Service Desk, managed on behalf of my Department by the Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education, will continue to liaise with the school on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, 3G\/4G services are not available on the DES Schools Broadband Network due to the fact that Service Providers cannot guarantee bandwidth and contention across their networks as outlined in the Department specification of service requirements, and generally their service comes with a restrictive download limit. Connections supplied through the Schools Broadband Network have no download limit, and provide an integrated set of services to schools which includes broadband connectivity, and hosted services including content filtering, and security services including anti-virus control and a centralised firewall.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is obliged to adhere to procurement regulations, and must engage with the selected providers on the DES Framework of Providers of Broadband Services through a tender process to award services. Having awarded a school service to the highest placed tenderer, the Department is then required to work with that provider to install the service. This is the basis on which all state-funding must be utilised to ensure transparency and equal treatment for all schools and providers, and adherence to regulatory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools The Group includes representatives of DES, PDST support service for schools, HEA-net and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The work of the Group will take account of the developments on the implementation of the Governments&rsquo; National Broadband Plan and its associated Intervention Strategy and the provision offered by industry.

A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2017 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools and to date, drawdowns from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,400 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). This represents more than one third of all primary schools. in 2012 less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2019, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. <\/p>  <p>  The policy of the Department through the Schools Broadband Access Programme is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and within financial constraints. Currently investment of some &euro;14m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools. Over the past three years my Department has invested some &euro;40 million in the Schools Broadband Access programme. Broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure. A Schools Broadband Service Desk, managed on the Department's behalf by the Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education, is a direct point of contact for schools on the programme, providing first line technical support and liaising with the providers to install and maintain services.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is obliged to adhere to procurement regulations, and must engage with the selected providers on the DES Framework of Providers of Broadband Services through a tender process to award services. Having awarded a school service to the highest placed tenderer, the Department is then required to work with that provider to install the service. This is the basis on which all state-funding is utilised to ensure transparency and equal treatment for all schools and providers, and adherence to regulatory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools The Group includes representatives of DES, PDST support service for schools, HEA-net and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The work of the Group will take account of the developments on the implementation of the Governments&rsquo; National Broadband Plan and its associated Intervention Strategy and the provision offered by industry.  The options identified will be reviewed and evaluated in a final report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[13046\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding geography in the junior certificate curriculum; his views on the concerns raised by the heads of departments of geography across Irish universities, organisations (details supplied) and others in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[13622\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will consider a review of the status of geography in the junior certificate syllabus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 361 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of Geography will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.

The Bill provides for the retention of the records, their transfer to the National Archives and their sealing and withholding from public inspection for a period of at least 75 years. <\/p>  <p>  The records of the redress bodies are unlike normal departmental records in that they contain information of a deeply personal nature that was provided to the bodies in the expectation that that information would be treated as confidential and private and the relevant legislation fully reflected that expectation.

The legal advice available to me is that that balance can best be achieved by ensuring that all of the records are withheld from public inspection for a lengthy period and the Bill provides that that period will be at least 75 years. It is essential therefore that no access to these records be permitted for that period and accordingly, it is necessary to provide in the Bill for the dis-application of those sections of the National Archives Act 1986 that govern access to the records by individuals, government departments, etc., and related provisions.<\/p>  <p>  While the National Archives Act provides for a certification process for the withholding from public inspection in certain circumstances of records that are more than 30 years old it does not provide the necessary certainty that the records will be withheld from public scrutiny for a sufficiently lengthy period.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied, having regard to all of the circumstances, that the approach set out in the Bill is the appropriate way to proceed in relation to these historically important, extremely sensitive and unique records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Appeals","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN04400"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[13080\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600070#WRN04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a request for school transport by a person (details supplied) will be reassessed;

The SESS, has a role to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes. <\/p><p>Through applications to NCSE&rsquo;s Supports Service, schools and individual teachers can access support in all areas of special education, including support in relation to individualised educational planning.<\/p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) also provides guidance for schools in supporting children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>NEPS works with schools through the Continuum of Support framework.  NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to Principals and teachers in relation to individual students needs and in the development of whole school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.  <\/p><p>NEPS psychologists provide advice and support around the identification of needs, the use of evidence-informed interventions and the monitoring of outcomes for individuals and groups of children.

The plan should include clear, measurable learning targets relating to priority learning needs, and specify the resources and interventions that will be used to address student needs in line with the Continuum of Support process. While class and subject teachers in primary and in post-primary schools retain overall responsibility for the provision of education to their students, in most instances special education teachers will lead and develop the student&rsquo;s support plan. As outlined in the Guidelines for schools, by using the Student Support File and the Continuum of Support process effectively, special education teachers can be confident that the priorities they have identified for the students are appropriate to the needs and most likely to advance learning. The planning process for students should include regular reviews of learning targets as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment, target setting, intervention and review. <\/p>  <p>  The Looking at our School 2016 quality framework, which is used to inform the work of inspectors as they monitor and report on quality in schools makes clear that inspectors review the quality of both teachers&rsquo; preparation and planning for teaching, and their teaching practice in light of the published Guidelines.  The extent to which inspectors focus on plans for students varies depending on the focus of the inspection model in use in any inspection. For example, in conducting specialised evaluations of provision for children with special educational needs at either primary or post-primary levels, inspectors will have regard to, inter alia, the manner in which teachers&rsquo; plans, either for individuals or groups as appropriate, identify clear, relevant learning objectives that are contextualised to pupils&rsquo; learning needs and the extent to which those plans facilitate appropriate provision for the learners concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":686,"content":"<p>Question No. 318 answered with Question No. 315.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[13152\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if it is a requirement of teacher training colleges that education relating to individual education plans be provided to trainee teachers.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>Under the Education Act 1998, schools are under statutory obligation to &ldquo;provide education to students which is appropriate to their abilities and needs&rdquo; and to &ldquo;ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability or other special educational needs, are identified and provided for&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  Planning is a normal part of a teacher&rsquo;s work and planning tools, like the student support file, have been created as a resource to help schools provide for their students.<\/p>  <p>  Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017, which introduced the model for allocating special education teachers to schools, noted the importance of educational planning. This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.<\/p>  <p>  The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Primary and Post primary Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools.<\/p>  <p>  All schools are therefore encouraged to use Education Plans or Student Support plans for children who are receiving additional teaching or care in schools. <\/p>  <p>  Whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement for schools to provide a particular form of Individual Education Plan, it is evident that the majority of schools do use some form of education planning to plan and record the support that they provide for pupils with special educational needs. This is considered to be both beneficial for schools and children and is regarded as best practice.  <\/p>  <p>  The ongoing provision of planning will represent a continuation of the good practice that is occurring in the majority of schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is the statutory body with responsibility for professional standards and regulation of the teaching profession. Under Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes are subject to review and accreditation by the Teaching Council, in accordance with the Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (published in 2011 and revised in March 2017). In accordance with these Criteria and Guidelines, inclusive education is a mandatory component for all students in ITE.  <\/p>  <p>  The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is currently carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  A recently published report from the National Council for Special Education on Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion: Phase 1 and 2 (NCSE Research Report No. 26), found that there is in general much good practice related to inclusive education in ITE, particularly in relation to the fostering of positive attitudes to inclusion, while also noting that there is scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular between student placement and the university experience. These findings will be considered by the Teaching Council in the course of its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO01000"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[13153\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount of the allocation to the Higher Education Authority that will cover pay restoration in 2019; and the amount same is projected to cost in 2020.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":692,"content":"<p>In Budget 2019 my Department secured additional funding of &euro;21.109m to meet the pay restoration costs for the third level sector in 2019.

The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-\/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community. <\/p><p>Transfer of patronage and consultation with school communities on reconfiguration is a matter for the current patron in the first instance. Any concerns or views that parents have should be discussed with the school patron.<\/p><p>The Reconfiguration process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. <\/p><p>In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out by the relevant City\/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. ETBs then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron\/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand. <\/p><p>The first Identification Phase<b><\/b>of the pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide, including the Malahide &amp;amp; Portmarnock area. It is envisaged that the Identification Phase reports from the initial areas will be published in the first half of this year.  <\/p><p>Following the completion of the Identification Phase, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase, which would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area. <\/p><p>The transfer to a new patron should reflect the wishes of parents and the school community. The Department envisages that such consultation would include an outline of contingencies that may be put in place for parents who wish for their children to retain the current ethos of the school, having regard to local circumstances.<\/p><p>The Implementation Phase would also provide an opportunity for potential multi-denominational and non-denominational patrons to engage in a consultative process with the existing school community, affording the best possible opportunity for patron bodies themselves to inform parents as to the unique characteristics of their schools. This may include a meeting where prospective patrons could provide information to the school community. <\/p><p>The Implementation Phase of the process has yet to formally commence. Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific school referenced by the Deputy, the existing school patron, the Dublin Archbishop, would lead the Implementation Phase of the process. <\/p><p>I understand that the Dublin Archdiocese representatives are in the process of holding meetings with a number of primary schools under their patronage in this area to provide information to them on the process rather than as part of the formal Implementation Phase of the Schools Reconfiguration process.<\/p><p>It is also possible for any school community to directly engage their current patron, outside of the main reconfiguration process, and to seek a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron, fast-tracking the patronage reassignment.  Already the first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  I encourage any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision to contact their school patron directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[13161\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a child who is in receipt of SNA assistance in a particular school and moves from that school to another location or school during the same school year is no longer entitled to a SNA in the new school and must wait until the beginning of September in the following school year in order to avail of a SNA once again; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1266","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  <\/p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030\/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie<\/i>, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  <\/p><p>In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p><p>Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[13162\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600071#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has been denied an SNA in view of the fact the child is entitled to an SNA based on particular needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1266","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  <\/p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030\/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie<\/i>, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  <\/p><p>In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p><p>As this question relates to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.

Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.<\/p><p>The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).<\/p><p>My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address:<\/p><p>snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600072#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":763,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600072#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":764,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[13406\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600072#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to open new ASD units in the Fingal area of County Dublin.","asker":"1259","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":765,"content":"<p>I am aware of the demand for additional special class placements in the Fingal area of Dublin.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education, (NCSE), an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, coordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

I will work with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to ensure that commencement is brought about as soon as possible following enactment of the Bill.   <\/p>  <p>  The operation of these sections in Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is dependent on commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act, which includes provisions for determination of parentage on which registrations, and re-registrations, will be based. This is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, who is working to ensure that commencement of these provisions is brought about as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  These are complex issues that require the involvement of more than just one Department. Officials from my Department, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Health and the General Register Office are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor-conceived children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600076#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1003,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[12911\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600076#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, excluding Part 8, will be fully implemented and all sections enacted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1004,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.

Each Division is then responsible for the allocation of its budget amongst its Districts. As District expenditure is not currently accounted for on an activity basis, it is not possible to isolate the cost of roads policing from other policing duties and costs.  The Garda authorities also point out that members who are not attached to the Roads Policing may be assigned to traffic duties, depending on operational need.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will however wish to be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently implementing a Roster and Duty Management System (RDMS) which will in future facilitate the costing of various duties, including Roads Policing. The RDMS is currently being piloted in the DMR East Division and wider roll-out to all Divisions is intended in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600076#WRT05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Data","counter":1029,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600076#WRT05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[12831\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600076#WRT05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of additional marked and unmarked Garda cars and vehicles allocated to each Garda division in 2018 and to date in 2019; the number that were withdrawn during the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that there has been an unprecedented level of investment in Garda resources across the State in recent years.  <\/p><p>A total of &euro;46 million has been provided by the Government for investment in the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021, in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>With regard to numbers of Garda&iacute; attached to divisions and stations or in particular roles or units much of the data requested is on my Department&rsquo;s website and is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>For general information on Garda Facts and Figures below is the link to the website:<\/p><p>More specific data for the Dublin Metropolitan Region North and North Central are available via the following links:<\/p><p>Overall Garda Workforce Strength 2006 to January 2019<\/p><p>Garda Numbers by Division District and Station 2009 to 31 January 2019<\/p><p>Garda Numbers by Division 2006 to 31 January 2019<\/p><p>Roads Policing Unit 2009 to 31 January 2019<\/p><p>Community Garda Strength 2008 to 31 January 2019<\/p><p>Garda Reserve Strength 2009 to 31 January 2019<\/p><p>Civilian Staff by Division and Station 2010 to 31 January 2019<\/p><p>Allocation of Probationer Garda&iacute; by Division and Station 2014 to January 2019<\/p><p>My officials are currently in the process of developing the website to provide additional information and data about other roles and units and I would encourage the deputy and colleagues to avail of this resource. <\/p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate a number of points regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which I believe are important to emphasise.<\/p><p>- Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations. The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>- When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. These national specialist units which form Garda Special Crime Operations are national units which support the work of the 28 Garda Divisions across the Country and are consequently not broken down by Division. Other examples of these include: the Special Detective Unit (SDU) which is responsible for the investigation of threats to state security and the monitoring of persons who pose a threat to the security of the State on both national and international fronts. The Unit also provides security for visiting VIPs, cash in transit movements and armed response and is the operational wing of the Witness Security Programme. The highly trained and equipped specialist intervention unit, the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) is also part of SDU. As the Deputy will appreciate, for security and operational reasons the strength of the SDU, ERU, Regional Support Units and the Special Tactics and Operational Command (STOC) Unit cannot be provided.<\/p><p>- There are Garda&iacute; with specialist training in public order policing in each Division who are available to be called upon when required to police events with an increased risk of a public order incident occurring, such as, protests or large scale public events. The number of Garda&iacute; called upon is dependent on the nature of the event. As such there are no Garda&iacute; assigned to public order units on a full time basis.<\/p><p>- Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs) are specially trained to fulfil a key role in implementing the Garda Diversion Programme. Their role includes the administration of formal and informal cautions as well as appropriate supervision of children who have been admitted to the Diversion Programme, as provided in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 200 trainees who passed out from the college on 8<sup>th<\/sup>March. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.

Under this architecture the Commission represents Ireland and other Member States\u00a0taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  As such, the EU is leading on all aspects of trade relating to Brexit.<\/p><p>Regarding Ireland and the EU's trading relationship with the United Kingdom once the UK has exited the EU, I am\u00a0acutely aware that a no-deal scenario would have\u00a0significant\u00a0impacts for our economy, and certain sectors in particular.  This is why the EU - with the full support of\u00a0our Government - has agreed a Withdrawal Agreement with the UK Government with a view to negotiating a Future Trading Relationship with the UK once it has exited the Union.  Such arrangements offer the best prospects of mitigating the negative consequences of the UK's exit from the EU for the UK itself, for the EU and for Ireland.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, in February 2018, my Department published research modelling the economic impacts of different Brexit outcomes.  It showed that, relative to a status quo baseline - that is, on a no policy change\u00a0basis - in 2030 Ireland&rsquo;s GDP growth would be\u00a0some 2.8% lower under an EEA type agreement, 4.3% lower under a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement and 7% lower on WTO terms than would otherwise be the case.  That is,\u00a0our growth rates over the period would be reduced by the impacts of Brexit, assuming no other actions were taken to address and mitigate the Brexit impacts.<\/p><p>Given\u00a0that exposure, the Government has consistently prioritised the need to avoid a no-deal scenario and maintain as close a trading relationship with the UK as possible post-Brexit.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be fully aware, and as noted already, the EU and UK negotiators agreed in December 2018 the Withdrawal Agreement.  This Agreement was the product of two years of negotiation taking into account the UK&rsquo;s &lsquo;red lines&rsquo; and the EU&rsquo;s requirement to protect and support the single market and the Good Friday Agreement.  The Deputy will also be aware that on 21 March, the European Council agreed with the United Kingdom to an extension until 22 May 2019, provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons during this next week.  If the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons, the European Council has agreed to an extension until 12 April 2019 and expects the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the Council.  The Government is hopeful of a favourable outcome in this regard and has noted that it is unfortunate that the UK Parliament have been, to date, unable to pass the Withdrawal Agreement.<\/p><p>As An T&aacute;naiste and An Taoiseach have both said recently, Brexit is a lose, lose, lose scenario - i.e. the UK, the EU and Ireland all lose out.  Nonetheless, were the UK&rsquo;s intentions for the future partnership to evolve further, the EU has made clear that the Union is prepared to\u00a0further adjust the Political Declaration that sets the parameters for the Future Trading Relationship, which\u00a0is designed to ameliorate as much as possible the negative impacts on trade and employment that will arise from Brexit.  All obligations and benefits of WTO rules will be considered in that context, but those considerations cannot be pre-determined at this time.<\/p><p>Finally, I might note that\u00a0we have recently enacted\u00a0the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions)\u00a0Act 2019 (the &lsquo;Omnibus Bill&rsquo;).  This piece of legislation allows the Government to amend a number of domestic laws in order to manage the negative sectoral impacts in the event the UK leaves the EU without reaching agreement on their withdrawal.  Additionally, the Government, on both a domestic and international level, are fully engaged with preparing for Brexit.

Particularly, as we draw closer to full employment, it is essential we continue to provide enterprise in Ireland with a high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent pool.

Using the latest available comparable data, the female participation rate in Ireland (56.4%) is significantly above the EU 28 average (52.1%). [1]\u00a0While the female participation rate has been growing in Ireland over the last number of years, there is still untapped potential in this area.<\/p><p>My Department actively ensures that suitable policies are in place to support increased participation across the economy. For example, Action 28 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 called for the identification of &lsquo;relevant policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates based on analysis of patterns of labour market participation&rsquo;. This action was fulfilled in H2 2018 under the guidance of an interdepartmental steering group. The analysis undertaken focused on three cohorts: females aged 25-55, people aged 55 and over, and people aged under 55 with a disability. In focussing on these cohorts, the analysis identified areas for further examination and was a key input to Future Jobs Ireland. <\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland identifies increasing participation in the labour force as one of its key pillars. It acknowledges that improving participation means the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of our workforce. Future Jobs Ireland sets the target of a substantial 3 percentage point increase in overall participation rates for people aged 25 to 69 years by 2025 with higher increases for females and older people. \u00a0In order to achieve this target, the framework details relevant ambitions underpinned by deliverables. The ambitions and deliverables relevant to increasing female participation include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p><p>- Encouraging participation in the labour force through high-quality Early Learning and Care. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables to complement the implementation of the Affordable Childcare Scheme including the introduction of additional ways to reduce costs, enhance supply and improve quality.<\/p><p>- Fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. This ambition assists in the development of an inclusive society. It is underpinned by a number of deliverables including the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave to allow for greater flexibility of parents.<\/p><p>- Improving incentives to participate in the labour force. This ambition includes a deliverable to consider income tax arrangements for second earners that optimise financial incentive to work, taking account of the impact that the income tax system may have on female participation in the workforce.<\/p><p>- Encouraging adult dependents and beneficiaries of other full-time welfare payments to engage in activation, enter and\/or stay in the workforce. This is ambition is underpinned by deliverables such as the development of a return to work service as part of the Public Employment Service offering; assisting women returned to work in the technology sector through Skillnets Ireland Women ReBOOT programme; and a review of recent analyses of inactivity to identify policy issues to support the development of policy responses.<\/p><p>- Undertaking promotional campaigns to encourage greater levels of participation in the labour force. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables including a communications campaign to promote awareness of the Public Employment Service as a real recruitment option, especially for those groups with lower participation rates; and the development of promotions for female participation as part of Jobs Week 2019 and Jobs Fairs.<\/p><p>Eurostat Labour Force Survey, Activity rates by sex, age and citizenship (%), Females aged 15 and over; Q3 2018: available from<i> <\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600084#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise 2025","counter":1422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600084#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1423,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[12755\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600084#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the details of jobs multiplier models used for employment forecasts in Enterprise 2025 Renewed; the latest forecast for each year ahead in the 2020 to 2025 period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1424,"content":"<p>Enterprise 2025 Renewed sets out an ambition for job creation focused on quality employment that is sustainable over the longer term with job creation throughout all regions.

This is an important piece of legislation as it enhances the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to benefit users of the service and society more generally and it forms an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s response to facilitate cost savings. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that SMEs have access to appropriate and affordable finance and my Department supports ongoing key SME access to finance initiatives including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme. All these schemes have been developed to meet the specific needs of SMEs and to provide finance at low cost levels and better terms and conditions to SMEs than that available on the marketplace.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the wide range of existing supports provided by my Department and Agencies, Budget 2019 allocated additional funding for my Department to boost business productivity,\u00a0for example\u00a0doubling of the Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25 million. An additional &euro;2.75 million was also awarded to Enterprise Ireland for its SME Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters Programme and &euro;5m to the LEOs to support a broad range of indigenous micro-enterprises to prepare for the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit.\u00a0Budget 2019 provides &euro;8 million extra for my Department&rsquo;s Brexit Response and expanding our Global Footprint. More broadly, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to Future Jobs Ireland 2019 which I launched with An Taoiseach earlier this month and which includes a dedicated pillar on improving SME productivity with a range of ambitions and deliverables for 2019. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to be aware of the role that the National Competitiveness Council plays in\u00a0relation to\u00a0competitiveness.\u00a0 The NCC is an independent advisory body that reports to the Taoiseach and the Government, through the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position. The reports published by the NCC, which include The Cost of Doing Business Report, Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard and Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge effectively monitor the cost of doing business in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600084#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Imports and Exports Data","counter":1428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600084#WRBB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1429,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[12763\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600084#WRBB01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the volume and value of imports on a percentage basis in 2017 and 2018, by country, in tabular form.

HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards.  In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspection of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards. A report of the inspection visit will subsequently be published on HIQA&rsquo;s website. In cases where remedial action is required, depending on the severity of the risk identified, HIQA may draw the matter to the attention of hospital management during the inspection and request an immediate response, or in less severe cases, will raise the issue in writing.

The first of these building blocks is a clear governance and accountability framework. As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the establishment of a HSE Board, the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 9 Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and 7 Hospital Groups were established on an administrative basis in recent years to plan and deliver community and acute care services respectively. These structures are not geographically aligned. While significant progress has been made by these structures, there is broad consensus that having separate and un-aligned structures for acute and community care impedes the development of a more integrated health service as envisaged under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.<\/p>  <p>  To address these issues, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends the geographic alignment of CHOs and hospital groups to support population based health planning and delivery, the design of the new regional bodies and ultimately the introduction of a form of regional health resource allocation. To support decisions on geographic alignment, the Sl&aacute;intecare report further recommends &ldquo;further analysis and consultation &hellip;to identify how alignment can best be achieved with minimal disruption to key structures including at community healthcare network level&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and the recently published 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan, I am committed to the development of a new system of health structures and governance as called for in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The Strategy and the Action Plan set out a number of actions that will lead to the development of a new system of health structures and governance comprising a leaner national centre with responsibility for national planning, strategy and standard setting, complemented by regional integrated care organisations with responsibility for the planning and delivery of services at a regional level. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommendation, my Department undertook a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups in 2018. In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional integrated care organisations. My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring these proposals to Government shortly.  This will take account of the 2018 consultation process and other planned engagement with key stakeholders, including CHOs, Hospital Groups and academic partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600086#WRDD06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","counter":1588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1589,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[12968\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional staff that will be recruited at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, to facilitate the opening of the new Dunmore wing at the hospital, by whole-time equivalent posts and by profession, that is, nursing, junior doctors, consultants, maintenance staff, clerical, administration, diagnostics and others; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1590,"content":"<p>As this is an operational issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":1591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1592,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[12969\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding which will be made available to University Hospital Waterford, UHW, to open and manage the 72 isolation beds that form part of the new Dunmore wing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1593,"content":"<p>As this is an operational issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1595,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[12970\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if University Hospital Waterford, UHW, has submitted a request for additional funding to staff and operate three floors and 72 beds in the new Dunmore suite at UHW.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1596,"content":"<p>As this is an operational issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Groups","counter":1597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1598,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[12971\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding which will be provided to the community healthcare organisation, CHO, in the south east to manage the two floors providing palliative care in the new Dunmore wing at University Hospital Waterford, UHW.

Each relevant Department is responsible for the implementation of their actions and the Department of Health co-ordinates a progress report on overall implementation which is produced on a periodic basis over the lifetime of the Strategy and presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. The Strategy contains actions to implement four national goals encompassing a recognition of the value and contribution made by family carers, a need to support carers to manage their own health and well-being, providing adequate information, training, supports and services, and the empowering of carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently engaging with other Departments with a view to developing a revised Action Plan for the further implementation of the Strategy. Meetings have been held between the Department of Health and a number of other departments and agencies to identify additional actions which can be carried out. A stakeholder consultation on the draft Department of Health\/HSE health-related proposals was undertaken at the Annual Carers Forum organised by the Department of Employment and Social Protection last November. Publication of the refreshed action plan is anticipated to take place later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of homecare and supports for cared for people also have a positive impact on the lives of family carers. Homecare is an increasingly important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals. Over 53,000 people will receive more than 18 million home support hours this year. <\/p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens. To do this, the Government has committed to the development of a new statutory scheme for home-support services to enable people with care needs to live at home for as long as possible. The scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-support will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. The new scheme will also be designed to support family\/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is also progressing various work-streams in order to deliver on the goal of implementing the statutory scheme. On-going work includes research to inform the conceptualisation of the overarching aim, objectives, actions and outcomes of the statutory scheme and the compilation of the data required for a review of the management, operation and funding of existing services.  Further consultation will take place as the new scheme is developed. <\/p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for adult home-support services is a complex undertaking. While to date important steps have been taken towards the development of the new scheme, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form that it will take. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing home-support services. The commitment to the development of this scheme has been reaffirmed in the recently published Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Addressing the healthcare needs of family carers enables them to continue to provide care to their loved ones. Following the enactment of the necessary legislation, free GP care was extended to those in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit on 1st September last year. The Department of Health has also secured funding through the Dormant Accounts fund to enable the HSE to pilot a Carer's Needs Assessment in one Community Healthcare Organisation. The HSE developed this tool with significant input from the Family Carer Reference Group, which represents a national network of over 200 carer groups across Ireland. The assessment will assist in identifying the needs of carers across all care groups and will track health and well-being outcomes for carers over time.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to ensuring that family carers receive as much support as possible to allow them to continue caring for their loved ones. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":1624,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1625,"qnumday":666,"qnumall":"[13054\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600087#WREE04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will issue in the case of a person (details supplied);

This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to Beneluxa, Ireland is participating in a number of other voluntary EU forums.  These platforms are currently exploring possible areas for cooperation including information sharing, horizon scanning and possible price negotiations and joint procurement.  Such platforms could also lead to faster access for patients for some treatments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600089#WRGG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Education","counter":1719,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600089#WRGG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1720,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[13205\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600089#WRGG01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the provisions being made to provide funding for practice nurse education; the reason no funding is available for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1721,"content":"<p>Practice nurses are not public employees but are employed directly by individual GPs who operate as independent private contractors.

","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1780,"content":"<p>In June 2018, I established the CervicalCheck Steering Committee to provide oversight and assurance on the implementation of key decisions taken by Government in relation to CervicalCheck, and to work to ensure a sustainable and effective cervical screening programme in the interests of women&rsquo;s health. The Committee is chaired by my Department and membership includes senior officials from my Department and the HSE, clinicians and patient advocates and representatives. The Terms of Reference for the Committee are published on my Department&rsquo;s website, as are the agenda and minutes of all Committee meetings.  <\/p>  <p>  Since its inception, the Committee has met 17 times and has overseen significant progress in a number of key areas. There is now a well-established and stable process for the provision of supports to women and families, in accordance with the Government decision; key staff have been appointed to CervicalCheck including a Clinical Director and staff with public health and cytopathology expertise; approximately 1,075 women have consented to be included in the Independent Clinical Expert Review and the slides are currently being independently reviewed. The Review will provide much needed-clarity for the women involved, and I look forward to receiving and publishing the Royal College's report.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  In September, the Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally completed its Report, providing a clear picture of what happened, and improving the understanding of the screening and audit processes and their limitations. The Committee oversaw the development of an Implementation Plan for all 50 recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry. The Implementation Plan published in December provides the necessary foundation to ensure a highly effective and well managed cervical screening programme. I welcome Dr Scally's recent progress report, published on the website of my Department last Thursday, in which he affirms that the Implementation Plan is a comprehensive response to his report, that significant effort and resources are being committed to addressing the problems he identified, and that the appropriate resourcing and project management structures are in place. The continued implementation of Dr Scally's recommendations is a key priority.  <\/p>  <p>  A second key priority is the introduction of the HPV test as the primary screening test. In conjunction with the extension of the HPV vaccine to boys, this will represent a significant step forward in public health and it presents the opportunity to work towards the near-eradication of cervical cancer. A project team is in place in the HSE and work is ongoing to drive this complex project forward.  <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this, a third key priority is to address smear testing capacity challenges such that the current backlog is eliminated and we ensure a sustainable programme into the future. The HSE is working very actively to put in place additional capacity, following extensive searches internationally.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE have been working intensively and at the highest levels to ensure these identified priorities are progressed as swiftly as possible, and continue to do so, and they are also the subject of discussion and reporting at monthly meetings of the Steering Committee. I am satisfied that the terms of reference of the Steering Committee encompass all of these matters but of course these are kept under review. I understand that the Committee is currently giving consideration to how best to support progress on these priorities and I look forward to this important work continuing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600090#WRHH01287","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Internships","counter":1781,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600090#WRHH01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1782,"qnumday":722,"qnumall":"[13282\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600090#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if medical students who graduated in Latvia are ineligible for internships in hospitals here as they are deemed to have completed their basic medical training;

The prevention approach aims to gradually change Ireland's food environment to one that facilitates consumption of healthier food and drinks and fosters active lifestyles.

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.<\/p>  <p>   On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016.  The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under the age of 1 year old and the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme takes account of this.  <\/p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  <\/p>  <p> There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children.

The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).

In some instances GP practices have a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients.  If this happens, patients should contact other GP practices in their area. While I have no role in relation to such matters, I would expect clinicians to consider the importance of patients having access to a GP service close to home when deciding whether or not to accept private patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices. <\/p>  <p>  In addition there has been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places available and in 2018 193 places were filled, an increase of around 60% over this nine year period.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract.  Talks between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation are continuing.

The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.  As Minister for Health, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases. <\/p>  <p>  Pembrolizumab has been granted marketing authorisation in Ireland and the EU for a number of indications and is included on the HSE reimbursement list for some of those indications. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Pembrolizumab is being assessed by the HSE, using the criteria in the 2013 Act, for a number of other indications for which it has received marketing authorisation. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decision of 11 May 2018 put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck.  Those measures included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement including Pembrolizumab, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician. The establishment of such a comprehensive support package reflected the impact of the lack of disclosure of the result of clinical audit and the ensuing controversy on individual women and their families. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2019, after careful consideration of the situation which had arisen in respect of patients with cervical cancer who were not encompassed by the terms of the support package agreed by Government for those affected by the CervicalCheck clinical audit non-disclosure issue, it was agreed that the HSE would put in place arrangements to facilitate access to Pembrolizumab for cervical cancer patients on a case-by-case basis in public hospitals when a treating clinician determined this to be in the patient&rsquo;s best interests. As Minister, I have of course no role in relation to how doctors manage the care of individual patients. All prescribing decisions are entirely a matter for the treating clinician, in line with patient safety protocols and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics.  This arrangement applies to cervical cancer patients only.  <\/p>  <p>  Clinical trials for various immunotherapies, including Pembrolizumab, are ongoing globally for a range of other possible indications, which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years. Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are granted and applications received.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to your request to exempt Pembro from 23% VAT, this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

These were accompanied by a lengthy submission detailing the PSI&rsquo;s rationale for the drafting of the Rules.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Pharmaceutical Assistants' Association (PAA) to discuss the association&rsquo;s concerns regarding the PSI&rsquo;s development of draft Rules governing the practice of registered pharmaceutical assistants during the temporary absence of a pharmacist.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the course of this process my Department has received correspondence from and on behalf of registered pharmaceutical assistants outlining their concerns with regard to the drafting of these Rules. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Pharmacy Act 2007, my role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent and in doing so I will give careful consideration to the Rules as submitted by the PSI and to the concerns raised by or on behalf of registered pharmaceutical assistants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600099#WRRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultant Contracts","counter":2328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600099#WRRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2329,"qnumday":909,"qnumall":"[14036\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600099#WRRR00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of surgeons active here that are suitably qualified to perform the complex surgery often required to treat endometriosis.","asker":"1242","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2330,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600099#WRRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":2331,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600099#WRRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2332,"qnumday":910,"qnumall":"[14037\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600099#WRRR01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason appointments to the consent declaration committee are behind schedule;

It specifies the conditions and minimum requirements for authorisation. It states that to estimate the performance of the automated grading method, the results of the automated grading method shall, for each validated carcass, be compared to the median of the results of the jury. The resulting accuracy of the grading by automated grading methods is established by using a system of points.  <\/p>  <p>  With a view to authorisation, the automated grading methods should achieve at least 60 % of the maximum number of points for both conformation and fat cover. There is no mention of 88% accuracy in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/1184 of 20 April 2017 governs the monitoring of carcase classification, carcase presentation and weighing.  In 2016, my Department conducted approximately 600 unannounced, on-the-spot inspections in 32 factories on classification.  In 2015, there were approximately 550 inspections conducted. In 2018, my Department conducted almost 550 unannounced, on-the-spot inspections. The controls applied in Ireland are significantly in excess of those required under EU Law.  <\/p>  <p>  To look at mechanical versus manual, in 2018 there were 412 inspections conducted in the 23 Mechanical plants and 136 conducted in the 9 manual plants. This is an average of 17 inspections per factory per year across all inspections, which significantly exceeds the legal minimum requirement of 8 inspections per year.<\/p>  <p>  There were 11 instances in 2016 and 5 instances in 2015 when factories were instructed to revert to manual classification when a machine was found to be working outside of tolerance by my inspectors. To date in 2019, 1 machine has been placed in test mode.  Machines operating outside of tolerance are required to be serviced, and the calibration is checked by staff from my Department before mechanical grading recommences.<\/p>  <p>  The EU legislation specifies how on-the-spot checks shall be carried out in all slaughterhouses applying compulsory carcase classification. According to this legislation, on-the-spot checks shall be performed in all slaughterhouses which slaughter 150 or more bovine animals per week at least twice every three months. The legislation stipulates that each on-the-spot check shall relate to at least 40 carcasses selected at random. <\/p>  <p>  In the UK and in Northern Ireland, it is individual factories, not the competent authority, who conduct performance checks on the mechanical classification machines on a daily basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding new technologies, my Department is supervising an industry-led trial which is examining the latest technology in terms of cameras and lights for use in the mechanical classification system.

It requires slaughterhouses to take measures to ensure that all carcasses of bovine animals aged eight months or more are classified and identified in accordance with the Union scale.<\/p>  <p>  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017\/1182 lays down the guidelines for authorisation of an automated grading method for beef.  It specifies the conditions and minimum requirements for authorisation.  For each validated carcass, the median of the results of the members of the jury shall be considered as the correct grade of that carcass. To estimate the performance of the automated grading method, the results of the automated grading method shall, for each validated carcass, be compared to the median of the results of the jury.  The resulting accuracy of the grading by automated grading methods is established by using a system of points.  <\/p>  <p>  According to the legislation, the automated grading methods should achieve at least 60% accuracy for both conformation and fat cover.  However, results in Ireland for classification were at much higher levels, for example, in 2018 with 91.8% accuracy for conformation and 84.8% for fat. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation states that carcasses shall be classified by assessment of Conformation and Fat cover and that Member States are authorised to subdivide each of the classes into a maximum of three subclasses. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the testing of new technologies, my Department is supervising an industry-led trial which is examining the latest technology in terms of cameras and lights for use in the mechanical classification system.

Subject to confirmation of effectiveness, my Department would expect the industry to move to implement this technology in due course though this is a commercial decision.  My Department is satisfied that the existing system is compliant with the relevant EU Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Controls carried out by my staff are set in legislation. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/1184 of 20 April 2017 governs the monitoring of carcase classification, carcase presentation and weighing.  It specifies how on-the-spot checks shall be carried out in all slaughterhouses applying compulsory carcase classification. <\/p>  <p>  According to this legislation, on-the-spot checks shall be performed in all slaughterhouses which slaughter 150 or more bovine animals per week at least twice every three months. The legislation stipulates that each on-the-spot check shall relate to at least 40 carcasses selected at random.<\/p>  <p>  Authorised classification officers conduct a classification exercise on a minimum of 100 carcasses at each inspection to determine that the performance of a classification machine is within tolerance. The unannounced checks verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Under the current system of monitoring the performance of the machine, officials check the overall performance of the carcass grading machine. The checks carried out by officials are system checks with officials looking for systematic errors rather than at individual cases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600101#WRTT02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2457,"content":"<p>Question No. 953 answered with Question No. 951.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2458,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 954 to 956, inclusive, answered with Question No. 952.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2460,"qnumday":957,"qnumall":"[12776\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600101#WRTT02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will issue a tender for software to facilitate each farmer receiving the digitised image of each animal further to comments by Minister Doyle during the second Topical Issue matter of 6 March 2019 and in view of the fact that his Department has direct access to the digitised image of each carcase that goes through a mechanical grading machine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":2461,"qnumday":959,"qnumall":"[12778\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600101#WRTT02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the length of time his Department holds the digitised image of each carcase that goes through a mechanical grading machine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":2462,"qnumday":962,"qnumall":"[12769\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600101#WRTT02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 239 of 6 March 2019, the reason his Department is now refusing access to the data in view of comments (details supplied) to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and Food on the introduction of mechanical grading; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2463,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 957, 959 and 962 together.<\/p><p>The mechanical grading machines are the property of each individual meat plant and the images generated by these machines are therefore retained on the factory's own computer system.

The Common Fisheries Policy (Article 5 of Regulation 1380\/2013) provides for the continuation of such neighbourhood arrangements. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen in which it found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law. It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.\u00a0 The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters. <\/p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements.\u00a0 The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment, in so far as it relates to access for Northern Irish vessels.\u00a0 If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.\u00a0 The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website.\u00a0While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland vessels to fish under the terms of the Voisinage arrangements, this access will be subject to the same conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s.\u00a0 A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. <\/p>  <p>  A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by\u00a0my Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged. The Department also appointed a firm of Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project.  \u00a0A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that, while\u00a0the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that it is classified as &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo;, this\u00a0classification\u00a0means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost.<\/p>  <p>  Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is on-going in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. The \u00a0Department&rsquo;s view is\u00a0that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken. It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.<\/p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors.<\/p>  <p>  The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, the consultants will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works.

My Department plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with other Government departments and State Agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the Health Service Executive. The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.  <\/p>  <p>   Labelling of food is governed by the EU food legislation on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (Regulation (EU) No. 1169\/2011), which lays down strict rules on labelling of ingredients.  Country of origin labelling is mandatory for certain meats and other products such as honey and wine. From 1 April 2020 it will be mandatory to indicate the country of origin of the primary ingredient (which makes up more than 50% of a food) if it is different from the country of origin of the product as a whole.  <\/p>  <p>   Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   <\/p>  <p>   My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.<\/p>  <p>   Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.<\/p>  <p>   The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>   I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.<\/p>  <p>   The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600103#WRVV03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Herd Data","counter":2590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600103#WRVV03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2591,"qnumday":1003,"qnumall":"[14255\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600103#WRVV03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the strength of the national beef herd, dairy herd, pig herd and the sheep flock; the extent to which numbers have fluctuated over the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2592,"content":"<p>The CSO's June Livestock Survey includes the information below for the years 2008-2018:<table><tr><th>000 head<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total cattle<\/td><td>6,902<\/td><td>6,891<\/td><td>6,607<\/td><td>6,493<\/td><td>6,754<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>- of which: Dairy cows<\/td><td>1,095<\/td><td>1,097<\/td><td>1,071<\/td><td>1,117<\/td><td>1,141<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-of which: Other cows<\/td><td>1,220<\/td><td>1,204<\/td><td>1,158<\/td><td>1,123<\/td><td>1,149<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total sheep<\/td><td>5,061<\/td><td>4,778<\/td><td>4,745<\/td><td>4,830<\/td><td>5,170<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>of which: Ewes<\/td><td>2,614<\/td><td>2,451<\/td><td>2,450<\/td><td>2,435<\/td><td>2,589<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total pigs<\/td><td>1,462<\/td><td>1,385<\/td><td>1,516<\/td><td>1,549<\/td><td>1,571<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>of which: Female breeding pigs<\/td><td>156<\/td><td>147<\/td><td>160<\/td><td>155<\/td><td>145<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>000 head<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>*2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total cattle<\/td><td>6,903<\/td><td>6,926<\/td><td>6,964<\/td><td>7,221<\/td><td>7,364<\/td><td>7,348<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>- of which: Dairy cows<\/td><td>1,163<\/td><td>1,226<\/td><td>1,296<\/td><td>1,398<\/td><td>1,433<\/td><td>1,481<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-of which: Other cows<\/td><td>1,150<\/td><td>1,129<\/td><td>1,076<\/td><td>1,104<\/td><td>1,081<\/td><td>1,048<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total sheep<\/td><td>5,007<\/td><td>5,097<\/td><td>5,139<\/td><td>5,179<\/td><td>5,197<\/td><td>5,106<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>of which: Ewes<\/td><td>2,568<\/td><td>2,514<\/td><td>2,488<\/td><td>2,505<\/td><td>2,515<\/td><td>2,499<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total pigs<\/td><td>1,553<\/td><td>1,555<\/td><td>1,537<\/td><td>1,594<\/td><td>1,557<\/td><td>1,621<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>of which: Female breeding pigs<\/td><td>147<\/td><td>150<\/td><td>148<\/td><td>149<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>149<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>* 2018 data is based on the CSO June Provisional Livestock Survey (except for Porcine figures).

This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities now having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing. The blackspot information received so far is providing useful and usable data regarding poor coverage in many rural areas and along national and regional roads.<\/p>  <p>  Various other initiatives are under way to address mobile coverage blackspots:<\/p>  <p>  - Both Departments have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.<\/p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.<\/p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg has now delivered a composite national outdoor coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  - Following a consultation process ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600104#WRWW05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":2665,"qnumday":1029,"qnumall":"[13055\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600104#WRWW05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when broadband facilities will be extended to the Old Bog Road, Cappagh, Kilcock, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":2666,"content":"<p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated version of the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map.

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality. For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2019 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation; Zone B: the Cork conurbation; Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000; and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. Ireland established a nationwide network of monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.<\/p><p>Information from these stations is provided in map format in near real-time at www.airquality.ie The most recent real-time data from automated stations is also currently provided by the EPA at  in the form of continuously updated graphs.

The AAMP will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland over the period 2017 to 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. As part of this on-going enhancement of the provision of real time air quality data to the public, the EPA will also shortly be launching a new map based dashboard to provide more accessible information to the public, to be followed by a station based Air Quality Index for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600105#WRXX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Aid","counter":2693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600105#WRXX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2694,"qnumday":1039,"qnumall":"[13735\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600105#WRXX02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a grant is available for a boiler to be fitted for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1305","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":2695,"qnumday":1046,"qnumall":"[13790\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600105#WRXX02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a grant is available for a boiler to be fitted in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1305","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":2696,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1039 and 1046 together.<\/p><p>The SEAI operates a number of energy efficiency upgrade schemes on behalf of my Department.

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. <\/p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.<\/p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department. <\/p>  <p>  I am, however, satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities.

In a submission to my Department dated July 2016, Sport Ireland identified a range of measures for which it was seeking additional funding in the 2017 Estimates. These measures included funding to support a proposal it had received from the FAI and which Sport Ireland was interested in supporting if funding was available to allow it to do so. The proposal related to the provision of financial support for the women&rsquo;s international team for soccer with a view to strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s chances of qualifying for the finals of major tournaments. The level of funding received in Budget 2017 was not sufficient to allow Sport Ireland to fund this measure.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a copy of the funding proposal was received in my office in October 2016 and was forwarded to Sport Ireland for their attention. In its submission for the 2018 Estimates, Sport Ireland once again identified this as a funding measure which they would support if funding was available.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, the CEO of the FAI requested a meeting with the Minister of State for Tourism and Sport and me to brief us on progress within the women's game and to discuss areas where my Department could assist the organisation in its efforts to positively drive the women's game forward.  Minister Brendan Griffin and I, accompanied by an official, met with the CEO and another representative from the FAI on 12 July 2017 at which they made a presentation on developments in the women's game, including their proposal for Government support. Minister Griffin and I undertook to consider the proposal.    <\/p>  <p>  In October 2017, having considered the proposal and having secured a modest increase for sport in the 2018 Budget Estimates, Minister Griffin and I indicated that the Government would facilitate increased support for the women's game as part of our commitment to develop women's sport from grassroots to elite levels. In March 2018, I wrote to the CEO of Sport Ireland directing Sport Ireland to allocate funding support of &euro;195,000 to the FAI for state support of the women's national team programme. <\/p>  <p>  As a normal part of the Estimates process, my officials had discussions with Sport Ireland in 2017 on its submission for the 2018 Estimates, which would have included discussion of this funding proposal. My officials also had discussions and correspondence with Sport Ireland and the FAI regarding how the funding would be allocated for the women&rsquo;s teams.<\/p>  <p>  As the allocation of the funding to the FAI and the terms and conditions for the funding, including assurances regarding the use of the funding, are a matter for Sport Ireland, I have referred the Deputy's question to Sport Ireland for direct reply in relation to the amount of funding that was issued to the organisation and the terms and conditions that were put in place.

Over the past four budgets however, investment has increased by some 117% - rising from in &euro;260 million in 2015, to &euro;575 million in 2019. <\/p>  <p>   This increased investment has been used to address the cost of Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare to parents through a range of universal and targeted supports:<\/p>  <p>  - The ECCE programme provides children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year. Since September 2018 children qualify for two years of universal pre-school.<\/p>  <p>  - The universal Community Childcare Subvention (CCSU) and targeted Community Childhood Subvention (CCS) Schemes provide weekly subsidies to offset fees charged by ELC and SAC settings. CCS is available to families who hold a Medical Card or are in receipt of social welfare benefits.<\/p>  <p>  - The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes provide a weekly subsidy to offset fees charged by ELC and SAC settings for parents on approved education or training courses, Community Employment schemes, or those returning to work.<\/p>  <p>  - Specific supports are also in place for children in emergency accommodation, in accommodation  centres provided by the State for persons in the protection process or programme refugee children in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres. <\/p>  <p>  Radical reforms to these schemes, based on the principle of progressive universalism, are in train. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced later this year, will replace the CCS and TEC schemes with a single, streamlined scheme. Under the NCS, parents will continue to have access to the universal subsidy to meet the cost of ELC. Targeted subsidies for children from 6 months to 15 years of age will be provided with the level of subsidy determined by family income. NCS will also create a flexible platform for future investment in funding, allowing subsidies to be expanded over time. <\/p>  <p>  The OECD in its report - Faces of Joblessness - compared the ELC and SAC supports previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the NCS. For a lone parent working full time at the 25th percentile of the full-time earnings distribution, ELC costs in Ireland were the highest among all OECD countries in 2015. The Faces of Joblessness report estimated that NCS will bring net ELC costs down to make Ireland only the 11th highest in the OECD, or closer to the OECD average. This analysis was performed before Budget 2019 which increased the NCS thresholds at both ends and which would have enhanced the results further if included. <\/p>  <p>   Notwithstanding this very significant progress, investment in ELC remains unacceptably low.<\/p>  <p>   In their latest calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on ELC, the OECD includes DCYA investment in ELC and an estimate of the DES investment in primary school for children under 6: this is to account for the fact that many children in Ireland start primary school at an earlier age than in some other countries. Based on Ireland&rsquo;s estimated GDP for 2016 and ELC expenditure estimates, Ireland will spend 0.5% of GDP on ELC in 2016 &ndash; with every .1% of GDP increase costing &euro;300 million. If the cost of primary school for children under six is excluded, Ireland will spend just 0.2% of GDP of ELC. This investment compares poorly to other European countries where the OECD average is 0.8%. It also falls short of the UNICEF-recommended investment level of 1% of GDP. <\/p>  <p>   First 5: A Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families published in November 2018 sets out an ambitious programme of work across Government Departments to improve the experiences and outcomes of children in Ireland from birth to age 5 across all aspects of their lives in the coming ten years.  One of the major objectives is that babies and young children have access to safe, high-quality, developmentally appropriate Early Learning and Care which reflects diversity of need.  Allied to that objective, First 5 identifies as a key building block additional public funding, strategically invested to achieve the best outcomes for babies, young children and their families.  Under this objective, First 5 commits to at least doubling investment in ELC by 2028.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2996,"content":"<p>Question No. 1153 answered with Question No. 1151.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse Reports","counter":2997,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2998,"qnumday":1154,"qnumall":"[12743\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the recent country report by the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children and, in particular, the multiple and wide-ranging criticisms of the fragmented nature of the approach by the Government to the issue of sexual violence against children, the lack of data and training and so on; and the urgent steps she will take to implement the recommendations of the report in full.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2999,"content":"<p>I welcome the recent report of the UN Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children that assesses the situation in Ireland following her visit last year and makes a number of recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding matters falling with the remit of this Department, I am committed to the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, which is one of the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur. My Department will shortly make a submission to the Attorney-General and once the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office has confirmed that all the requirements of the Protocol have been met, I will seek a Government decision on the ratification at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I am also committed to implementing relevant legislation and policies, as highlighted by the Special Rapporteur. I would like to note that The Children First Act 2015, which I fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for reporting and management of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children. In addition to that, the Children First National Guidance contains full details in relation to reporting a reasonable concern and making mandated reports. I would like to add that Tusla has committed to implement a strategic multi-annual work force plan to meet the short and medium term needs of the organisation and address the comments in the report regarding the shortage of social workers.<\/p>  <p>  Joint working between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forms an integral part of responding to the issue of sexual violence against children and achieving a joined-up approach. A number of joint working initiatives are underway to enhance co-operation and a Children First Joint Working Protocol for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\/Tusla- Child and Family Agency Liaison has been published to reflect the provisions in the Act. The Protocol covers respective responsibilities in key areas including notification of suspected abuse between both agencies, confidentiality and information sharing and liaison structures. In addition, an inter-agency data sharing agreement is currently being finalised and expected to be launched during 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality has also overseen the establishment of Divisional Protective Services Units (DSPUs), which are a major commitment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme. They will deliver a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of specialised crime types, including sexual crimes, human trafficking, child abuse and domestic abuse. Ten DSPUs are currently up and running, with the remaining 19 to be established on a phased basis by the end of this year. Furthermore, the review into protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, initiated by my Ministerial colleague, is considering the issue of access to specialist training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the judiciary and legal professionals dealing with sexual offences.<\/p>  <p>  The report also calls for the implementation of the &lsquo;one house&rsquo; model. I would like to reiterate my commitment to the establishment of these multi-disciplinary centres that will bring together forensic, child protection, health, therapeutic and policing services in a child centred way to support children and the families of children, who have suffered sexual abuse. The first pilot centre will open in Galway in 2019 and it is expected that centres in other locations will follow. <\/p>  <p>  I am also taking measures to progress the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s other recommendation in relation to the comprehensive examination of certain anomalies related to historical adoptions. Following the discovery of cases of illegal birth registrations in the Saint Patrick's Guild records, I initiated a targeted review of adoption records to determine if similar evidence of illegal registration can be identified from the records of other former adoption agencies and other relevant bodies. Given the volume of potentially relevant records, a targeted review of records currently in state custody is being conducted in the first instance. The findings of this review will assist me in reaching a decision about what, if any, subsequent action might be deemed necessary to identify more fully the scale of illegal birth registrations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions","counter":3000,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":3001,"qnumday":1155,"qnumall":"[12744\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the meetings of the collaborative forum have been suspended; if so, the reason therefor; and when she will publish the report of the collaborative forum sent to her in December 2018.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":3002,"qnumday":1156,"qnumall":"[12745\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to appoint a new chairperson to the collaborative forum to replace the previous chairman who resigned.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3003,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1155 and 1156 together.<\/p>  <p>  I established the Collaborative Forum last year as a progressive response to the theme of &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; which emerged from my initial consultations with former residents of these institutions. This innovative approach facilitates and empower former residents to actively contribute to Government deliberations and action on matters of concern to them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Submitting its first report within 6 months was a significant achievement for the Forum and reflects the intensive investment and commitment of participants to this new approach to dialogue. I want to acknowledge the strength and courage of each and every member of the Forum in contributing to this important work.<\/p>  <p>  In its report the Forum identifies priority issues for former residents and makes recommendations in the areas of health and well-being supports, identity and language, and memorialisation.  In submitting this comprehensive report, the Forum has substantially delivered on its initial Charter and mandate. <\/p>  <p>  When the Forum presented its draft report to me, I committed to seeking Government approval for its publication subject to the legal advices of the Attorney General.  Significant legal issues were subsequently raised in the legal advices provided to me.

I intend to further update the Forum on how I propose to proceed when I have the opportunity to meet with members early next month. <\/p>  <p>  While solutions are being sought to the above issues I am also taking steps to advance consideration of the report&rsquo;s detailed recommendations.

The Forum itself also suggested a revisiting of these matters.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently examining how best to reflect upon the learning from process to date and I will ensure that the Forum is directly involved in this process. The approach to identify and appoint a new Chairperson will be considered as part of this process.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that consistent engagement with former residents and other stakeholders on the matters of concern to them is essential while the Commission of Investigation continues with the important work it was established to do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":3004,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":3005,"qnumday":1157,"qnumall":"[12746\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600110#WRCCC05200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the comments made by the UN rapporteur regarding concerns over the limited scope of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3006,"content":"<p>I am aware of the comments made by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Sale and Sexual Exploitation of Children. When I met the Special Rapporteur in the course of her visit to Ireland in May 2018 I set out the rationale and context to the Government's approach in establishing the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters).  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission's terms of reference provide the necessary balance of inclusivity, specificity and focus, so as to ensure that the Commission can deliver on public expectations. In framing the terms of reference there was a deliberate emphasis on investigating the experiences of women and children who spent time in this type of institution but the terms of reference actually reflect a much wider agenda of related public concerns.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas were required to approve the draft Order and Statement of Reasons for the establishment of this Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The relationships of Mother and Baby Homes with other institutions, organisations and individuals involved in the entry and exit of children and mothers from these institutions will be explored by the Commission as required by Article 1(VII) and in the academic social history module as required by Article 11 of the terms of reference. The Commission will investigate evidence of patterns of referral, relationships and co-operation with other entities and intermediary organisations. <\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference require the Commission to identify the extent to which children&rsquo;s welfare and best interests were considered in making arrangements for placements, whether through &lsquo;boarding out&rsquo;, fostering or adoption, both in Ireland and abroad. They further ask the Commission to identify the extent of mothers&rsquo; participation in such decisions, including procedures around mothers&rsquo; consent, and the extent to which these procedures were sufficient to ensure that consent was full, free and informed. <\/p>  <p>  This allows the Commission sufficient scope to examine both the issue of placing children for adoption abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means.<\/p>  <p>  In recognising that new information could be uncovered in the course of the investigation, the independent statutory Commission has a wide remit to examine a broad range of public concerns, to decide on their importance to the Commission's work, and to make recommendations on them as it sees fit. Under its terms of reference, the Commission is required to report on any specific matters outside its scope which it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest as part of the Commission&rsquo;s work. The Government is on record as stating that it will consider any recommendations made by the Commission in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission will report on how Irish society responded to single women and their children at a time when they most needed our support and assistance.

It sets out a ten-year plan to improve the lives of children up to the age of five and their families.  The actions will be delivered by a number of Government departments, State Agencies and wider partners. <\/p>  <p>  One of the actions in First 5 is to develop mechanisms to provide additional supports to Early Learning and Care settings where there are high proportions of children who are at risk of poverty in order to mitigate the impacts of early disadvantage.  The development of this model will be informed by the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools model, DEIS, which operates at both primary and second level. <\/p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan for First 5 is currently being developed in preparation for publication in May.  The plan will cover Phase I of implementation and set out annual milestones for each of the first three years of the strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Given the significance of the work to develop a programme for the delivery of Early Learning and Care in the context of concentrated disadvantage, and the importance of putting in place robust systems to benefit children and to ensure accountability for public money, it is essential that proper scoping, detailed analysis, piloting and evaluation takes place for this project.  Some of the first steps, which will proceed this year, will include developing a methodology for assessing levels of concentrated disadvantage in Early Learning and Care settings and analysis of the types of additional supports in Early Learning and Care that will help to address disadvantage.  It is likely to take some time before the model is refined for roll out, with funding secured.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, I can assure the Deputy that the current targeted subsidy schemes are not being dismantled. Rather, they are being streamlined in to one comprehensive scheme from October: the National Childcare Scheme (previously the Affordable Childcare Scheme). Streamlining the existing targeted subsidy schemes will make them more accessible for both parents and providers. The Scheme will provide a fair and consistent system of progressive financial support towards the cost of Early Learning and Care and School Age Care, with a particular focus on low income families but also incorporating universal supports, and provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for the subsidy programmes currently in operation may still be made until the National Childcare Scheme goes live in October 2019, after which applications to these programmes will close. Therefore, for the 2019\/2020 programme year, both the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the existing support programmes will run simultaneously. The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCS) will be merged with the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme Plus (CCSP) for the final programme year and will cease completely in 2020. To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, parents will be able to join the NCS as soon as it launches or remain in their current programme for the final programme year. If a parent wishes to change to the NCS at any point throughout the year, they can remain on their current support programme right up until their Early Learning and Care or School Age Care provider registers them for the NCS and they confirm the registration. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will comprise two types of subsidies, universal and income-related. The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level, for children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months. Income-related subsidies are payable for children between 24 weeks and 15 years, and the level of subsidy payable is determined by the family&rsquo;s reckonable income. This reckonable income represents gross income minus tax, PRSI, and other deductibles and any applicable multiple child discount.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Childcare Support Act 2018 allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for Early Learning and Care or School Age Care on grounds of child development or child welfare. Families with high levels of need, who require Early Learning and Care or School Age Care for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.  Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements.  There is no general minimum or maximum age limit for a child who is the subject of a referral by a sponsor.  However, sponsor bodies will adhere to strict criteria for qualification for referral as set out in Agreements made under section 14 of the Childcare Support Act 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600111#WRDDD05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Funding","counter":3066,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600112#WREEE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3067,"qnumday":1180,"qnumall":"[13183\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600112#WREEE00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 312 of 13 March 2019, if the cost on an annual basis of placing a child in private residential care is &euro;312,000; and the proportion of this that is spent on caring for the child rather than on profits, dividends and so on.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3068,"content":"<p>The purchase of residential placements from private providers is an operational matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

Unfortunately, this means that many services that submit high quality applications ultimately do not receive an offer of funding because the budget is not there to facilitate this. <\/p>  <p>  As a means to address this, the 2019 Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital applicant guidelines, released on 31 January 2019, introduced a rule that clearly states that early learning and care services who have received funding under the equivalent strand of EY Capital (i.e. Creation of New EY Places) between 2016 and 2018, are not eligible to apply under Strand A (Creation of new places for 0-3 year olds) in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of this rule enables the distribution of capital funding around as wide a range of services as possible over a four-year cycle.<\/p>  <p>  In the interest of fairness and equity, this rule must apply to all services without exception.<\/p>  <p>  The service in question is not eligible to apply for funding this year under Early  Years Capital 2019 - Strand A, as they received funding in the equivalent strand in 2016.

community and private, in providing world-class childcare and meeting demand for childcare places, and I anticipate that this year's Capital programme will build on last year's good work in the

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early years care and education.<\/p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending. AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Applications for grants or funding may fall under Levels 1, 5 or 7 of AIM.<\/p><p>AIM Level 1 recognises that a strong culture of inclusion must be fostered and embedded to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE programme. This includes the new higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC), established in 2016 with provision for 900 students annually for four years. Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from LINC and has agreed to take on the role of Inclusion Coordinator (INCO) in the pre-school setting) will receive an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.  <\/p><p>AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or minor alterations capital grants for early years&rsquo; settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.<\/p><p>AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. <\/p><p>The table shows data provided by Pobal regarding the number of grants approved under AIM Levels 1, 5 and 7 by

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early years care and education.<\/p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending. AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and applications are processed through Pobal&rsquo;s Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP). Applications for support may fall under Levels 1, 4, 5 or 7 of AIM.<\/p><p>AIM Level 1 recognises that a strong culture of inclusion must be fostered and embedded to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE programme. This includes the new higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC), established in 2016 with provision for 900 students annually for four years. Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from LINC and has agreed to take on the role of Inclusion Coordinator (INCO) in the pre-school setting) will receive an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.<\/p><p>AIM Level 4 provides access to mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists. To avail of this support, pre-school providers, in cooperation with parents, are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile. This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.<\/p><p>AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or minor alterations capital grants for early years&rsquo; settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary. <\/p><p>AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. To avail of this support, pre-school providers, in partnership with parents, complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile, including the Level 7 service request. <\/p><p>Pobal has provided the following information regarding the number of AIM applications being processed and the average waiting time for an application to be processed on PIP as at 14<sup>th<\/sup>March 2019:<table><tr><th>AIM Level<\/th><th>Number of applications in process as at 14th March 2019<\/th><th>Average waiting time for an application to be processed on PIP as at 14th March 2019 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>AIM Level 1 &ndash; INCO capitation<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>16 working days<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AIM Level 4<\/td><td>146<\/td><td>10 working days<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AIM Level 5<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>5 working days<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AIM Level 7<\/td><td>203<\/td><td>31 working days<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>AIM Early Years Specialists carry out observation visits, rather than assessments, on children. They observe the child in the context of their pre-school, using the Access and Inclusion Profile. This information is then used to determine the type of support the pre-school can access under the model, to support the child&rsquo;s meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Pobal has advised that, as at 21<sup>st<\/sup>March 2019, 73 children were awaiting an observation visit.<\/p><p>The average waiting time for a child to receive an observation visit from an AIM Early Years Specialist is influenced by when the application is submitted. Pobal has advised that requests for AIM Level 7 that are made at the same time as an AIM Level 4 application have an average waiting time of 9 working days. Requests for AIM Level 7 that are made following an AIM Level 4 support visit or telephone call have an average waiting time of 17 working days. Similarly, the timing of when the application is submitted will affect the maximum waiting time for a child to receive an observation visit from an AIM Early Years Specialist. Pobal has advised that they have recorded maximum waiting times of 140 working days (concurrent AIM Level 4 and Level 7 application) and 169 working days (consecutive AIM Level 4 and Level 7 application). However it should be noted that, in both of these cases, the AIM applications were submitted in the spring before the children started in their pre-school that September. The pre-schools and parents involved in these cases were keen to be prepared in advance of the children starting in pre-school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600112#WREEE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":3095,"qnumday":1190,"qnumall":"[13278\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600112#WREEE03200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of LINC workers by county, in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3096,"content":"<p>The Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC) higher education programme is a Level 6 Special Purpose Award designed to support the inclusion of children with a disability in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.

I warmly welcome this finding as I am strongly committed to high quality early learning and care and my Department is taking important steps to ensure childminders are central to the provision of early learning and care.<\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0is currently finalising a Childminding Action Plan, which will contain short, medium and long term goals.  This action plan will set out steps to move incrementally towards the wider regulation, support and professional development of childminders, along with a timescale to bring them into mainstream provision.  A National Childminding Coordinator has recently been recruited who, along with six regional Childminding Development Officers to be appointed in the coming months, will spearhead implementation of the first phase of the Childminding Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Garda vetting, childminders who care for four or more pre-school children from different families or seven or more children of any age (other than their own children) fall within the scope of regulation, and must therefore register with Tusla, be Garda-vetted and meet other regulatory requirements (e.g. having first aid training).  The Childminding Action Plan will map out a pathway for bringing a much wider cohort of childminders within the scope of regulation, who will then also be required to be Garda-vetted and meet other regulatory requirements.  My Department is actively engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality on the matter of Garda vetting in the context of these plans.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to training for childminders, much is already available in this regard, and I intend to increase the training available through the forthcoming Childminding Action Plan.  The Childminding Action Plan will include plans to support the upskilling of childminders though both initial training and continuing professional development.<\/p>  <p>  More immediately, the Children First Act 2015 imposes statutory obligations on certain people to report child protection concerns at or over a defined threshold to Tusla.  My Department established the National Early Years Children First Committee in 2013, who are responsible for rolling out child protection training across the early learning and care sector.  This training has been made available to all childminders who are registered with Tusla.  A free online 'Introduction to Children First' e-learning module has also been developed by Tusla and is available for everyone to complete.  Other resources in relation to safeguarding training will become available in 2019, which childminders will be able to avail of.  In addition, through the City and County Childcare Committees my Department will shortly make available financial support for early learning and care providers to receive First Aid Response training, which will be a regulatory requirement from June 2020.  In addition to one funded place for every registered provider, I am also providing ring-fenced funding for a number of childminders to take part in the training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600113#WRFFF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":3148,"qnumday":1209,"qnumall":"[13813\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600113#WRFFF02700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of childminders registered with local city or county childcare committees; the number of childminders who have been Garda vetted; the number of childminders in receipt of childminder's tax relief; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3149,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended), only childminders who care for seven or more children or who care for 4 or more pre-school children of different families (other than the childminder's own children) are required to register with Tusla.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.  My Department believes that our approach to compliance and\u00a0supporting services\u00a0strikes a necessary and appropriate balance.  Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.<\/p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment.  It is\u00a0a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, the most recent of which was published on 9 August 2018.  Compliance with these rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Because subsidies for the\u00a0early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is\u00a0a vital governance component of\u00a0the funding for which my Department is responsible.  As funding is based on attendance, the Department cannot restore funding which was provided on the basis of registrations which did not match actual attendance.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as the one referred to in your question, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country.  I also appreciate the impact reduced income, as a result of compliance visits, can have on their service. Hence, significant support is available to them to ensure\u00a0 sustainable, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.<\/p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges.  This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance.  Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I am encouraged however that\u00a0most\u00a0services\u00a0have engaged constructively with the process so far.  I would recommend this service, and any other service, to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or\u00a0advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) will replace the targeted schemes later this year.  My Department&rsquo;s policy relating to the NCS was informed by evidence and with the best interests of children and families in mind.  The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.<\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses.  The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate.  A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.<\/p>  <p>  Under NCS, subsidies will be paid to a service provider for a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.  At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling\u00a0&euro;575 million per year.  Community services access much of this growing investment.  Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) and co-payments \/ top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade.  This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600113#WRFFF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":3171,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600113#WRFFF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":3172,"qnumday":1217,"qnumall":"[14085\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600113#WRFFF05100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the budget for domestic sexual and gender based violence services in 2017 and 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3173,"content":"<p>Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the provision of care and protection to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV).

This approach, which includes generous provision for homecaring periods, will benefit many such pensioners, especially those who took time out of the workplace for caring purposes.  The required primary legislative provisions are contained in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act 2018, enacted on 24 December 2018.  All the necessary regulatory and system changes have now been made to allow the increased payments to begin. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is now reviewing the pension payments of approximately 91,000 pensioners who were awarded less than the maximum rate of pension since September 2012.  Given the number of pensioners involved, this work will take a number of months to complete.  The increased payments will also include arrears to the 30th March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  The Department is using information it already has to complete these reviews.  However, in quite a number of cases, additional information is required from the pensioners concerned about gap periods in their social insurance records and my Department will be in touch with each of those pensioners individually to get that information. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the TCA model that will apply for all new pensioners post-2020, I launched a public consultation on the design of the full scheme on 28 May to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over three months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.

As a Public Employment Service, Intreo offers the full range of Intreo services to all citizens of working age including income supports and activation services. <\/p>  <p>  Entitlement to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is conditional on a jobseeker being available for and genuinely seeking work. Jobseekers are supported in their efforts to secure employment through the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and other supports. In turn, jobseekers commit to take reasonable steps to avail of opportunities to improve their prospects of employment.<\/p>  <p>  The jobseekers activation process includes a range of approaches including referral to job vacancies, education and training supports and nomination to JobPath, Local Employment Services and direct employment schemes such as TUS and Community Employment. <\/p>  <p>  Entitlement to jobseeker payments is dependent on participation in the activation process. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of engagements with jobseekers take place on a one to one basis.  However, it has also been found that active marketing and promotion of opportunities and communication of wider employment and training options can play a valuable role in supporting jobseekers.  Intreo Job Week and aligned initiatives that are run throughout the year showcase these opportunities and provide the opportunity for large numbers of jobseekers and others to meet recruiting employers. At these events employers can meet, inform and interview potential applicants, while job seekers get the chance to ask questions, identify opportunities for upskilling and make important connections. Career fairs are excellent networking opportunities for people to meet those already working in their preferred industry and to identify options for education and training. <\/p>  <p>  Invariably, these events are always well attended, reflecting the very high levels of interest in them.

Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment at 18 years of age, without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training, can lead to welfare dependency from a young age.  The reduced rates for aged 18 and 19 JA recipients were first introduced in April 2009 and extended to jobseekers aged 20 to 24 from December 2009.  The reduced rates were further extended to 25 year olds in Budget 2014.<\/p>  <p>  A key feature of the introduction of the JA rate reductions was that subsequent participation in full-time education and training would lead to an increased rate in payment.  As a result, if a young jobseeker on a reduced JA payment participates on an education or training programme they receive the maximum weekly personal payment, currently &euro;198.  Budget 2019 increased the rate of JA weekly rates by &euro;5 which means that JA customers under 26 years of age will also benefit from an increase of &euro;5 in their personal rate of payment from 25th March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work 2016-2020, the Department committed to review and report on the impact of the reduced rates for JA recipients aged 18 to 25.  The National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM) undertook research which examined the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training and employment.  My Department did not commission this research but allowed the NUIM access to the data from the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Longitudinal Database to undertake this research.  The University examined data for 18 and 19 year olds as the reduced rates were first introduced for this cohort.  The NUIM published its findings in December 2018 which found positive results noting a significant reduction in unemployment durations.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department's officials recently met with the authors of the NUIM publication and have used their detailed findings as an input into my Department&rsquo;s own review of the impact of the reduced JA rates.

In addition, it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from schemes like CE. Communities benefit from the skills and talents of participants and, in addition, participants are provided with the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, many CE schemes provide vital community services across the country, all of which are well embedded in these communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution it makes to local communities.  In that regard, the Government has agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements for activation and social inclusion CE placements.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, following the review of the CE scheme in 2015, a decision was taken to adopt a two strand approach for all CE placements and they were categorised as either a training\/activation strand or a social inclusion strand.

This scheme will continue to be subject to continuous improvement and reviewed on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>   The Department values the local services provided by bodies such as the Local Employment Service (LES) very highly  and will continue to depend on local service providers to supplement and complement its own direct service provision into the future.

CE supervisors, as employees of these organisations, are an integral part of that good work.  We simply could not sustain a lot of our local community services without their work and it is, of course, a concern to me that the Supervisors felt compelled to take industrial action on the 18th February 2019.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the industrial action relates to a claim by CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise the fact that CE scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding. They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions, pension contributions or the Pension-related Deduction (PRD) under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.  All employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal.  <\/p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the numbers involved, which is hard to establish.

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.<\/p>  <p>  Wherever possible reviews will be processed using information already held by my Department.  In some cases additional information is being requested to ensure people receives the best rate possible.  Approximately 25,000 requests for information have issued to date.  It is important that prompt responses are received to those requests so that the reviews can be completed as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Reviews commenced from 13 February 2019, the day after I signed the necessary regulations which together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made.  The most recently available figures show that as at week ending 22 March 2019, 8,367 reviews have been completed.  <\/p>  <p>  It will take a number of months to complete all the reviews due to the number involved and the individual nature of social insurance records.  Over 100 temporary staff have been recruited to help with this work.  Outcomes will issue to all pensioners in writing when their review is complete.  <\/p>  <p>  Regardless of when a review is conducted, where an increase in payment is due, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay and arrears issued backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.   <\/p>  <p>  Given the scale (90,000 pensioners) involved, the fact that each case requires close individual examination and that some cases are more complex than others, it would not be reasonable to expect all to be processed immediately. While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcome of their review in writing. <\/p>  <p>   Where possible, reviews will be processed based on information already held by the Department. For the majority of pensioners the next letter they receive from the Department (after the first letter) will be a review outcome letter. Where additional information is required to complete the review, a written request is being sent to the pensioner directly. Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks. I would urge anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that their review can be processed.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600119#WRMMM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":3505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600119#WRMMM01200"},{"type":"question","counter":3506,"qnumday":1331,"qnumall":"[14155\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600119#WRMMM01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) for a carer's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3507,"content":"<p>An application for carer's allowance (CA) was received from the person concerned on 9 October 2018.<\/p><p>It is a condition for receipt of a CA that the person being cared for must have such disability that they require full-time care and attention.<\/p><p>This is defined as requiring from another person, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself and likely to require that level of care for at least twelve months.<\/p><p>The evidence submitted in support of the application was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence did not indicate that the requirement for full-time care was satisfied.<\/p><p>The person concerned was notified on 16 January 2019 of this decision, the reason for it and of their right of review and appeal.<\/p><p>My department were notified on 5 February 2019 that the person concerned had appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).

Furthermore, under National Policy Objective 18b, my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies, such as Irish Water, and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.  <\/p><p>The development of such a programme must take account of lessons learned from experience with so called &ldquo;Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure&rdquo; (DPI), which my Department&rsquo;s National Taking in Charge Initiative (NTICI) examined and reported on.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <\/p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>I understand that Irish Water will be bringing forward proposals for a Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the NPF. The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s Investment Plan. <\/p><p>Irish Water is to work with Local Authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies.  I understand that it is proposed that the overall national budget for this Programme by Irish Water would be allocated between counties, based on an identified need against set criteria. <\/p><p>Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of the submissions from Irish Water to the CRU on its detailed investment plans under the Irish Water Investment Plan 2020 to 2024.  These submissions are currently being considered by the CRU and a decision is expected from the CRU in the second half of 2019.  <\/p><p>The broad approach outlined in the document &ldquo;Water Services Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rdquo; which I published last year in draft format under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), is that there is effective coordination between planning authorities in their planning functions, Irish Water in its rolling capital investment programmes and local community interests.  <\/p><p>The draft Guidelines highlight that it is the policy of Irish Water to facilitate connections to existing infrastructure, where capacity exists, in order to maximise the use of existing infrastructure and reduce additional investment costs; and that there is a general presumption that development will be focused into areas that are serviced by public water supply and wastewater collection networks with the exception of domestic systems for single dwellings.  I propose to issue final Guidelines shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600120#WRNNN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":3567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600120#WRNNN01300"},{"type":"question","counter":3568,"qnumday":1352,"qnumall":"[13873\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600120#WRNNN01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on whether changes are needed to the strategic infrastructure planning process in order to prevent applicants applying for planning permission for the same project on multiple occasions in view of the difficulties faced by local communities in mounting opposition to an application on repeated occasions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3569,"content":"<p>I do not consider that planning legislation should be amended to prevent an applicant who has been refused planning permission in respect of a particular development proposal from subsequently submitting a modified planning application, even if it could be considered somewhat similar or substantially the same as a previous planning application. <\/p>  <p>  This approach is considered to be reasonable as any subsequent planning application in respect of a specific development proposal will in all probability differ in certain material respects from any previously submitted planning application that has previously been considered and refused.

As valuation lists in local authorities are revalued, as part of the national revaluation programme, only commercial elements of properties are valued and therefore domestic allowances become obsolete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600120#WRNNN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":3576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600120#WRNNN02200"},{"type":"question","counter":3577,"qnumday":1355,"qnumall":"[12809\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600120#WRNNN02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a person who has exited bankruptcy may be considered a first-time buyer for the purposes of a Rebuilding Ireland mortgage application; if he is satisfied with this position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3578,"content":"<p>Applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan must be of good credit standing and have a satisfactory credit record.

Part B is set out in broad performance terms.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the review of Part B\/TDG B Fire Safety. It has been decided in the interest of clarity to separate the guidance into two volumes.  A new Part B\/ TGD B Volume 2 was published in 2017 and came into force on 1 July 2017. This Volume 2 applies to dwellings only.  Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, is currently being prepared for public consultation shortly.  This guidance document will provide greater clarity on the conditions required to demonstrate compliance with Building Regulations taking into account the changes in standards since the last review.<\/p>  <p>  Part III of the Building Control Regulations require a Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) to be obtained for new buildings (with some exceptions) and certain works to existing buildings.

As such, an application is examined technically, by the Chief Fire Officer \/Building Control Authority, for compliance with Part B, either on the basis of TGD B or through alternative approaches to providing fire safety.

Promoting the efficient and sustainable use of water is central to my Department&rsquo;s water policy. The Government's Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, as published in May last year, sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing that will be pursued between now and 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2017 and, in line with the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this will involve the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks. The National Leakage Reduction Programme in particular includes investment of some &euro;250 million over the next four years under the Find and Fix repair scheme and the Water Mains Rehabilitation programme.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative provision to discourage the excessive use of water services was included in the Water Services Act 2017. Excessive usage is determined by reference to the threshold amount of 213,000 litres per household per annum as specified by ministerial order with effect from 1 January 2018, in line with provisions contained in sections 8 and 9 of the Water Services Act 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water is responsible for developing and implementing the necessary administrative arrangements, including billing arrangements, subject to oversight and approval by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The amount to be charged will be determined by the CRU and the process that is to lead to a decision in this regard has now commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Once administrative arrangements and charges have been approved by the CRU, Irish Water will be in a position later this year to notify relevant customers who, having regard to their consumption patterns during 2018, appear to be consuming water services excessively and therefore potentially liable for excessive usage charges.  Only customers who continue to consume water services excessively during the six month period following receipt of a formal notice in this way, will become liable for charges to cover excessive usage during the six month notice period and any subsequent periods.<\/p>  <p>  The overall aim is to encourage water conservation rather than to generate revenue.  On this basis, I understand that Irish Water will work proactively with relevant customers to identify whatever practical steps may be necessary in order to address their situation and bring their consumption back within the threshold level.  Additional allowance amounts for water usage will be available to larger households (where the number of residents exceeds four) and exemptions will be available in cases of medical need.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee recommended a proactive approach to promoting awareness of water conservation, and Irish Water places a strong emphasis on this important area. A dedicated section on the Irish Water website provides information in relation to water conservation at www.water.ie\/bewatersmart. The content includes suggested lifestyle changes to save water and information on how to check for water leaks in the home.  Information is also available on water saving devices outside of the home, including rainwater butts and rainwater reuse for the farming sector.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s website also has a facility where members of the public can report leaks in public areas. Based on the information provided, Irish Water will follow up to confirm a leak on the public mains and complete a repair.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water supports a number of environmental education campaigns which raise awareness, promote understanding and encourage people to take action on water conservation issues. This includes the Green Schools Programme, which has delivered savings of 360 million litres of water in schools in one year alone. Irish Water has also engaged with primary and secondary schools as part of Engineers Ireland&rsquo;s Engineers Week, to increase knowledge and awareness of water conservation and its benefits to the environment.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has undertaken a research study to provide an in-depth understanding of household water usage. The insights will help guide the roll out of product and behavioural interventions to improve water conservation in Ireland.

Irish Water is the lead authority in relation to the management and conservation of public water supplies.<\/p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the EPA in relation to its role in respect of water and wastewater services, including with regard to the resource implications arising from its responsibilities. Under its Water Quality Programme, my Department funds the EPA to conduct a range of activities to facilitate and support the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive, including the water quality monitoring of rivers, lakes, estuaries and groundwater.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to policy on water conservation, the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, which I published in May 2018, sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The EPA was involved as a key stakeholder in the process leading to preparation of the Policy Statement, which is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p>  <p>www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/water_services_policy_statement_2018-2025_0.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  The Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this will involve the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks. The National Leakage Reduction Programme in particular includes investment of some &euro;250 million over the next four years under the Find and Fix repair scheme and the Water Mains Rehabilitation programme.<\/p>  <p>  This Policy Statement was informed by the 2017 Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and which includes a number of recommendations in relation to the continued use of metering to support water conservation, to reduce leakages and to ensure compliance with the European Union Water Framework Directive, as opposed to for revenue raising purposes.  The Water Services Policy Statement is consistent with this position.<\/p>  <p>  The Water Services Policy Statement is expected to influence all stakeholders, including An F&oacute;ram Uisce which has a statutory role in relation to water conservation and the EPA in respect of developing research proposals.

In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and\/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. In multi-unit developments, the \"person having control\" is generally the owner management company. Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not intended to establish a new Building Standards and Consumer Protection Agency, stronger compliance with building standards has been a key priority for Government in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade.  The Building Control Reform agenda was initiated in 2011, when a high level working group reviewed the existing building control regulatory framework. The key deficits identified in the regulatory regime were the lack of involvement of construction professionals on site and lack of accountability in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In response, a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda has been developed:<\/p>  <p>1. Reform of the Building Control process;<\/p>  <p>2. Establishment of a National Building Control Management Project; and<\/p>  <p>3. Putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing.<\/p>  <p>  These reforms, while some are still in progress, have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600121#WROOO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Agency Data","counter":3640,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600121#WROOO02800"},{"type":"question","counter":3641,"qnumday":1379,"qnumall":"[12996\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600121#WROOO02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of the &euro;70 million rolling Housing Agency fund by county; the number of units delivered per annum since its inception to date by county; the average cost for each unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3642,"content":"<p>Under Actions 1.1, 2.5 and 5.6 of Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Housing Agency is actively engaged with banks and investment companies in relation to its acquisitions programme.

The Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, buying and leasing new social houses. All funding is conditional on the properties being made available to households on local authority waiting lists.<\/p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing. The housing units are secured under long-term leases\/availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs, the cost of which is recouped to local authorities by my Department. The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the establishment of the Housing Agency Acquisition Fund.<\/p><p>The capital advance is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually 30 years. All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.<\/p><p>To date, 26 AHBs have availed of CALF to secure homes for social housing use. Funding eligibility is aligned to those AHBs signed up to and demonstrating compliance with the Voluntary Regulation Code.<\/p><p>The CALF scheme delivers housing through close collaboration between AHBs and local authorities.  This collaborative approach ensures that there is local authority support for the project prior to submission to my Department.  Applications for funding for a scheme or individual homes, which have not progressed, may have fallen out of the process for various reasons and applications may also be resubmitted with revisions or by another AHB.  Some 1,000 applications (with some 12,000 associated dwellings) for CALF have been made since 2011.<\/p><p>The CALF was introduced on 24 June 2011 and only a small number of AHBs availed of the facility during the period 2011 to 2013, delivering a total of 498 additional social housing homes under the scheme. Only over the last number of years has the sector moved to accessing private funding\/ borrowing and moving away from full exchequer support. Since 2014, the number of homes delivered using CALF support has increased significantly year on year, along with Exchequer funding to support AHBs to access finance for the provision of new social housing. CALF expenditure in 2018 was &euro;120.8 million; this included &euro;2.18 million, which was offset against Local Property Tax funding, and 2,315 additional social housing homes were completed in 2018, as a result of CALF assistance. A provision of &euro;94.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2019.<\/p><p>At the end of Q4 2018, there were some 3,600 homes in the CALF acquisition and build pipeline, which will be delivered out to 2022. To date &euro;220 million had been loaned by local authorities to AHBs and a further &euro;231 million has been approved for lending but has not been drawn down.<\/p><p>Owing to the nature of the CALF scheme, home delivery does not always arise in the same year as expenditure being incurred.

In order to qualify for social housing support and be placed on a housing list, an applicant must be assessed by the authority concerned as meeting all of the eligibility and need criteria set down in the legislation. Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations. <\/p><p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. <\/p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. <\/p><p>In terms of my role regarding housing policy, and recognising that there are people who do not qualify for social housing but find it very challenging to purchase or rent at market rates, the Government has brought in new measures specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes. <\/p><p>Affordable housing is generally targeted at households earning a maximum gross income of &euro;50,000 (single applicant) or &euro;75,000 (joint applicant). Affordable homes to buy will be delivered under a new statutory Scheme; the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 were commenced last year and I recently signed regulations in respect of the making of a Scheme of Priority, which local authorities must do before 18 June 2019. Further regulations and detailed guidance will issue to local authorities in due course.<\/p><p>This new Scheme replaces all previous affordable purchase schemes; is led by housing authorities; is a shared equity scheme with a fully repayable equity share\/discount; and the equity repayments will be pooled into a strategic affordable housing fund managed by the Housing Funding Agency (HFA). <\/p><p>The Scheme is complementary to other Government schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was introduced from 1 February 2018, following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan. The new loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p><p>Single applicants for the loan may earn up to &euro;50,000 gross per annum, while the combined income of joint applicants may be up to &euro;75,000 per annum.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings. The maximum dual-income threshold also applies to the new Affordable Purchase Scheme which will enable a maximum purchase price of c. &euro;320,000, which is in line with the purchase limits set out under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website: .  Subject to certain conditions, any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.<\/p><p>Given the affordability challenge faced by renters, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is specifically tasked under the legislation with protecting the interests of customers.  <\/p>  <p>  An important aspect of the CRU&rsquo;s work is ensuring that Irish Water&rsquo;s revenue is spent appropriately to improve services for customers. To facilitate this, in November 2016 the CRU outlined a framework of 19 key performance metrics against which it would monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s performance and progress over time. The metrics cover customer service, environmental performance, quality of service for water supply, security of water supply and sewerage service. Monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s performance relative to these metrics will facilitate an evaluation by the CRU of the utility&rsquo;s performance. It also ensures that transparent data becomes available to customers through the publication of performance data. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent Irish Water Performance Assessment Report published by the CRU in February 2018 is available at the following weblink - www.cru.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/CRU18034-Irish-Water-Performance-Assessment-Report-No.-2-February-2018.pdf . <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the CRU plans to publish a further Performance Assessment Report later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2017 has strengthened the arrangement in place for stakeholder engagement, accountability and transparency in relation to the provision of water services.  The Water Advisory Body has been placed on a statutory footing and empowered to advise the Minister on the measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water for the purpose of increasing the confidence of members of the public in Irish Water and to report to an Oireachtas Committee on a quarterly basis on the performance of Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan.  The Act also established An For&aacute;m Uisce to provide a platform for public engagement on all matters relating to water as an environmental, social and economic resource.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the above, I am confident that appropriate arrangements are in place for the delivery of water services and the development of the Water Sector in line with the needs and expectations of customers and users. <\/p>  <p>  It may also be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

This included a funding measure to support community connections to the public network operated by Irish Water.  The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services.  The Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, includes the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, Environmental Protection Agency, Health Service Executive, Department of Rural and Community Development and local authorities, through the County and City Management Association.  It has also consulted with other key stakeholders, including Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 addressed the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021, while Strand 2 is considering the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the recommendations of the Working Group, which took into account the lessons learnt in the first multi-annual funding cycle 2016-2018 as well as the ongoing developments in the wider water services sector, I approved the multi-annual programme for the 2019-2021 cycle.  The 2019-2021 funding cycle consists of eight measures. Most are further broken into sub-measures. These measures reflect the key challenges currently facing the rural water sector.<\/p>  <p>  Measure 6, Community Connections (Water and Wastewater), facilitates the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies and central wastewater collection systems by extension off the public network.  It includes a sub-measure, Community Connection: Wastewater Network. This sub-measure will support wastewater collection for population clusters, currently on deficient individual wastewater treatment systems (septic tanks), immediately adjacent to towns and villages, through the development of community wastewater connection networks as extensions to the existing public (Irish Water) wastewater collection system.<\/p>  <p>  There is significant cost involved in delivering, and particular professional skills needed to operate, a sewerage scheme. The operation by community-based groups of their own sewage treatment facilities, which are technically more complex than group water treatment facilities, has not been included under the Rural Water Programme. This is because of the difficulties for voluntary groups in managing and maintaining such facilities in the long term. The relevant sub-measure under the Programme is therefore designed with this in mind.<\/p>  <p>  Strand 2 of the considerations by the Working Group is currently underway and I expect a further report later in 2019.

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and  a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.<\/p>  <p>  In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/framework_for_enhancing_fire_safety_in_dwellings.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/fire_safety_in_ireland_-_report_of_the_fire_safety_task_force.pdf. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going to review Part B &ndash; Fire Safety and a new Part B\/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017.

A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, which includes apartments, is being prepared for public consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade, my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:<\/p>  <p>  -  Amendments to the Building  Control Regulations; <\/p>  <p>  -  Establishment of a  shared services National Building Control Management Project; and<\/p>  <p>  -  The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry   Register Ireland) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600122#WRPPP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":3702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600122#WRPPP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":3703,"qnumday":1404,"qnumall":"[13442\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032600122#WRPPP04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the quarterly social housing construction pipeline report will include Traveller-specific accommodation from the next report; and when the report will be published.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3704,"content":"<p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Status Report, which provides information on the status of many of the various social housing new build projects underway nationally.

Proposals under consideration by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.<\/p>  <p>  Having considered the Working Group's report as well as the recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on short-term lettings, I recently announced plans to introduce a &ldquo;one host, one home&rdquo; model in areas where there is high housing demand. <\/p>  <p>  Homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.<\/p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.<\/p>  <p>  Issues in relation to taxation are a matter for colleague the Minister for Finance.
