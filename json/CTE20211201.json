Over the past number of months the committee has facilitated discussions with us on a number of occasions, and I would like to acknowledge that at the start.  The committee and Chair's continued engagement with young farmers is greatly appreciated.  This evening, our ask has a particular focus on the area of young farmers in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of months and, indeed, even years, the next tranche of the Common Agricultural Policy has been up for debate and negotiation both at the EU and governmental levels.  We are now getting to the crunch period before it has to be submitted to the Commission before the end of December.  The documents that have been circulated on the CAP strategic plan over the past number of months have been positive in light of being visible for farm organisations as well young farmers across the country.  However, we view it in the context of the ever-changing environment in which farmers and young farmers see themselves in, particularly in the context of the European Commission in 2017 and 2018.  Elevating generational renewal is one of the main key deliverables and objectives under this Common Agricultural Policy.  It is key to remember that during the course of those negotiations at European level and, more recently, at national level, the importance that has been placed on ensuring that there is a sustainable and viable sector for future generations to partake in within the sector.  Young farmers play a key role in addressing the challenges that we as an industry face, but also see a huge amount of opportunity in terms of bringing the sector forward over the next number of years and into the decades beyond.  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland, our agricultural land base is primarily based in terms of our livestock sectors, supported by and spread across tillage and other enterprises also.  The breakdown of young farmers across those enterprises over the past decades has decreased significantly.  Even in the five years from 2011 to 2016 there has been a 15% decrease in the number of active young farmers under the age of 35.  It is to the backdrop of those stark figures and in the context of general society, where the workforce within other economic and entrepreneurial sectors across the economy shows that the average workforce under the age of 35 represents almost 30%.  In that context, the support for young farmers in the context of CAP and even in the national envelope needs to be strengthened and increased.  <\/p> <p>  If we look at the traditional barriers that have existed for young farmers over the course of the past number of decades, whether that be access to credit or land, investment support or start-up aid, we see a lack of support and commitment within the current guise of the CAP strategic plan for young farmers to address those barriers that we face on an ongoing basis.  If we also look at our counterparts across other EU member states, covered very eloquently by Diana Lenzi, the current president of Conseil Europ&eacute;en des Jeunes Agriculteurs, CEJA, the European Council of Young Farmers, at our annual conference last Friday, those barriers exist across other EU member states also.  However, there have been discussions and parameters are being put in place to support and address those barriers in other EU member states.  <\/p> <p>  We look a little closer to home in terms of the context of access to land and we look at our own land mobility service being called out within Commission's proposals and documents and the lack of support in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy and the CAP strategic plan.  We acknowledge the commitment from the Minister in the past week for an increase of funding from the national envelope for next year but it is important that service is committed and is provided into longer term.<\/p> <p>  In regard to access to credit from a young farmer's perspective and under current state aid rules, we realise we are working within the parameters of those state aid rules and recognise that one of the only possible alternatives to address that is support for young farmers with financial instruments.  We have seen it called out within the Common Agricultural Policy within the Commission's proposals.  We have also seen some of our counterparts within other EU member states, notified to us by CEJA, have engaged in endorsing and developing financial instruments specifically to support young farmers.  We see that within our own CAP strategic plan that critical access to finance and that the barrier for young farmers over past decades has not been addressed.<\/p><p>We believe that is a significant limiting factor in ensuring the sustainability of the number of young farmers under the age of 35 as we move forward.  From a delivery point of view in the course of this CAP period, we believe the litmus test of this CAP period will be the number of active young farmers under the age of 35 farming actively by 2027.  Agriculture, as I previously touched on, is a complete outlier in terms of what the people and the demographic of the sector look like.  Over the past ten years the number of farmers over the age of 55 and, indeed, 65 has increased, while the number of active and progressive farmers under the age of 35 has decreased.<\/p><p> Addressing the issues in terms of succession pathways to enter the industry has been something that we in Macra na Feirme have called for over many years as well as addressing the need in order to provide an opportunity for older generations to have financial security as they exit farming while also ensuring that young farmers have supports to enter the sector.  In regard to what we can do to develop a succession scheme that provides for that, issues have been identified with previous early retirement schemes.  Our proposals have centred around a succession scheme as opposed to an early retirement scheme.  We recognise that within media outlets over the past number of weeks there has been a recognition or a floating of a scheme related to decarbonising, and a succession scheme relating to that.  We believe any scheme must offer an opportunity for young farmers to enter the sector while also supporting those who are exiting the sector.<\/p><p> The key issue for our members that has spanned almost a decade at this stage has been the forgotten farmers.  This is a cohort of farmers who set up agricultural holdings before 2008, many of whom are still under the age of 40 but have low value entitlements and are also deemed ineligible for young farmers access to the national reserve.  We recognise the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has committed to resolving the matter of forgotten farmers in the context of the new CAP arrangements and to ensure those farmers are not forgotten any longer.  We see within the current proposals of the CAP strategic plan that that cohort of farmers has not been facilitated nor provided for in an amount of funding to address that issue.  Approximately 3,500 farmers are in that category.  They feel they have been forgotten and left out from valued supports, such as installation aid, young farmer top-ups and supporting schemes throughout the CAP.<\/p><p> The other key issue from a young farmer's perspective is start-up aid.  We recognise there is a contribution from the national envelope and tax relief to encourage young farmers to enter enterprises.  However, we recognise and have seen from our counterparts across the EU that start-up aid and installation aid have formed part of previous CAP plans in other EU member states and have been used effectively to ensure that initial boost of capital for young farmers to establish their enterprises while also meeting the challenges of compliance which we understand will increase on farms over the next couple of years.  The cost of establishing and setting up a farm enterprise is a huge initial investment for a young farmer.  For someone coming into the industry who lacks collateral or security, that initial injection of capital investment can prove a barrier.<\/p><p> Moreover and more wholly in terms of the eco-schemes that have been proposed in the context of CAP, we believe there is a gap and a need and an opportunity for additional eco-schemes and measures to be included.  The CAP proposals from a Commission point of view include a progressive and increased day's grazing at grass, while also looking at the actions which enhance animal welfare and address antimicrobial resistance, such as faecal dung sampling and milk recording.  It is in that context that we should continue to improve and drive our performance.  When we compare ourselves on the latter to the average EU performance, we are less than half in terms of our antibiotic use within this country and that is something we should be proud of but also something we should endeavour to improve.  In the context of the eco-schemes and when we look at our countryside, we are unique in the hedgerow cover we have throughout the country.  We have looked for a hedgerow management policy and measure.  That can benefit both the farmer and biodiversity throughout the country.  We recognise this is something that all farmers have a role to play in.<\/p><p> I reiterate my comments at the start.  I appreciate the engagement of the Chair and the committee.  My fellow Macra na Feirme members, Mr. Dillon, Ms Richardson, Mr. Fitzgerald, and I look forward to the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keane.  As usual, that was a very comprehensive statement from Macra na Feirme.  We are focusing on young farmers and I will make one comment before I hand over to the members.  The focus and comments have been on CAP.  It is about generation renewal.  Current farmers have to be confident and secure in passing responsibility on to the next generation.  That is something that needs to be addressed if we are going to encourage transfer of land.  We must think of the older generation as well and ensure it is confident in doing so.  Many points have been very well made there.  The forgotten farmers have been talked about in regard to many CAP programmes but no initiative has been put in place for them.  Hopefully this time around, there will be some financial recognition of the fact that through no fault of their own, they lost out, as Mr. Keane mentioned, on installation aid, young farmer's top-ups and the grants and incentives for younger farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#B00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Keane and his colleagues.  I regret we are not able to meet in the committee room.  I thank Macra na Feirme for its ongoing engagement with the committee and its constructive role not only in assisting this committee in its different deliberations but also in helping to shape Irish farm policy more broadly in a very progressive direction.  I commend everybody involved in that.  For a young farmers' organisation, its professionalism is evident in all of our interactions.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions, which I will ask separately.  Mr. Keane or any of his colleagues can respond to them as they see fit.  The starkest figures referenced in the opening statement were the difference between 2005 and 2016 in terms of young farmers acting as farm managers.  The figure was down from 10.7% in 2005 to 6.1% in 2016.  The overall figures that 5% of our farmers are young farmers and that 30% are over 65 years of age points to a crisis.  Do the witnesses think we have moved from the position where we were heading towards a terminal decline or do we have the foundations, if not the building blocks, to reverse that trend?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keane mentioned that we cannot manage what we do not measure.  What type of targets need to be set in regard to the next CAP so that we can measure the success of the next programme to 2027?  In other words, what is the bare minimum?  Do the witnesses believe the strategic plan, as currently outlined, is fit to deliver that purpose?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#B00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I might bring in my colleague, Mr. Fitzgerald, on this.  To touch on the Deputy's initial remarks in terms of the number of young farmers and the number of farmers over the age of 65, to broaden that out to a wider context and given that we are in Covid-19 times and are joining the meeting through Microsoft Teams, if the health service had an age demographic similar to that we have described in terms of young farmers, the Deputy would be correct in saying that it would be a crisis in that sector.  From a young farmer's point of view in our sector, and addressing the challenges and the opportunities we have to meet as we move forward, where we are right now and given the trend we have seen from 8,700 young farmers in 2016 or 2017 claiming the entitlements and the payments for young farmers, down to about 7,400 last year, show that trend is continuing.<\/p><p>That has to be verified by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, but those are the figures we are dealing with.  I agree there is a need and pressure to ensure that demographic is reversed and changed.  In terms of targets we can set as a sector as we move forward, we benchmark and reference it with other sectors across the economy at somewhere between 35% and 30% under the age of 35.  We must be realistic and live in the real world and realise that we are not going to get to those levels in a three to five-year period.  The measures being proposed to address the key barriers that exist for young farms are not going to deliver a numerical change in the number and percentage of young farmers under the age of 35.  If we look across some of the more progressive EU member states and at supports for young farmers, the percentage of young farmers in Austria and some of the Nordic countries is in the mid-teens, anywhere between 14% and 18%.  There are regional figures in other countries, including Germany, France and elsewhere, where those figures are similar, and even higher.  From our side, that is where we need to aim.  That is the benchmark and the water level on which this CAP strategic plan must deliver.  The key issues are access to land, credit and initial start-up support.  The point the Chairman made about ensuring that older generations have security as they move out of the sector is one of the key things.  As young farmers, we recognise there is a need to ensure that those people who have contributed so much to the economy and to the sector over 30, 40 or 50 years are not just pushed to one side.  We must recognise their experience, their input and the progress they have made in the past 30 and 40 years, and not let that be overlooked.  We must ensure that both ends of the spectrum are supported.  As well as young farmers entering through the measures I have touched on, there should be a succession scheme and a pathway to ensure that older farmers have that financial support and security as they move on their career.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>In terms of the other member states operating within a EU framework that have much better and healthier proportions of young farmers operating, is there a key flagship programme that some of those operate under?

Yes, there are a number of countries with various instruments and schemes.  They are not all solely confined to the CAP.  There are taxation measures within their national envelop that provide for it, whether that be, as I mentioned earlier, early retirement schemes, or early transfer of land and favourable conditions for that within their national taxation systems, or identification of a successor at the mid-50 mark so that somebody is there to take over the farm when those people reach retirement age.  In the context of CAP, we have seen increased supports exist in other EU member states with respect to installation aid or start-up aid.  We have seen higher levels of support in terms of investment support.  We have also seen the use in other EU states of that critical issue of access to credit.  Other member states operate specific targeted financial instruments aimed at supporting young farmers, in particular.  Within our own context of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and other loan schemes for farmers in general, naturally enough, we see that when those are put out through pillar banks and other institutions, the lowest risk option will be selected.  If you compare a young farmer who might have limited collateral, a limited track record or limited security versus the person who has 20 or 30 years' experience in an industry or business, has a more secure backing, some collateral and a proven track record, naturally enough, when there is a limited pot of money, they are going to move towards the latter.  That is why that specific element of the financial support, which we have seen working in other countries and jurisdictions, addresses that key need.  It is something we need in this country for young farmers, in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keane.

When we look at Food Vision 2030 and the ambition to reach &euro;21 billion over that period of time, if the trajectory of the return of the value from the food chain of the farmer continues, despite the value of our product increasing, it will not be delivering for farmers.  That is not a situation farmers can tolerate.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the solution piece, I recognise measures regarding the unfair trading practices, UTPs, have a role to play.  However, when the measures on UTPs were being drafted and were out for public consultation, Macra na Feirme looked for a number of additions to them to further protect farmers.  I cannot provide those off the top of my head right now.  They are not on the tip of my tongue, but we can certainly send them on to the Deputy.  It was more in line with ensuring that the farmer at the base level had more of a say, more control, and more sight over what happened within the supply chain.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the food ombudsman has a role in providing clarity and to help redistribute that.  We understand there is a procedure and a protocol that has to be gone through.  From a farmer's point of view, in general, we recognise that in the 2021 budget, &euro;1 million was set aside for the establishment and development of the national food ombudsman.  Roll the clock 12 months forward, in the 2022 budget, which we heard in October, &euro;4 million was set aside for the establishment and development of the national food ombudsman.  Some 12 months further on, from a layman's and a farmer's point of view, we have not seen much progress in the establishment or development of that.  We understand it is not among the regulations and the Bills in the Houses before Christmas.  There is an urgency around this.  Ensuring farmers have a valued place within the food supply chain has never been more important.  From a young farmer's and a farmer's point of view, it begs the question of the urgency around ensuring that clarity is brought to the sector and that redistribution of supply and power is brought into the sector.  From our side of things, urgency is needed on that given that we are 13 or 14 months on since the initial allocation of &euro;1 million for its establishment and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The big issue is going to be around generation renewal and succession if we are going to do all that Mr. Keane said.

Similar to what happened in the previous one, for a period of five years, there was a stepped payment with the transfer of land for the young farmer over that period of time as well.  That support payment provided to the older farmer is provided on a stepped basis, on a yearly basis, based on the percentage of the land that is transferred to the younger generations.  We also looked at it in the context of the previous scheme, which was called the early retirement scheme, and the need for the older farmer to completely separate himself or herself from on-farm activity.  We recognised that was neither a healthy relationship nor feasible, relevant or practical for the older generations to completely leave the wellingtons at the back door and never go further than that.  There has to be recognition within that that the older generations stepping back from farming still have a role within the farm business, whether that be advisory, herding the cattle or travelling to the local mart.  That social element for the older generation is intrinsically important to ensure their own well-being and their value of place, because we recognise that being in a sector for 30 or 40 years and putting a blunt end at the end of it and stopping one morning is not conducive for the well-being of the older generation.<\/p> <p>  That support payment tapered out over a period of five years as well as the land transaction for the young farmers, the financial contribution from young farmers and the financial understanding of young farmers being developed over that period has been a critical part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Keane happy enough that we can devise a scheme?

That shows there is the opportunity and possibility for that to deliver.  That demonstrates and shows that financial control and financial contribution from a young farmer's point of view, as well as the transfer of the ownership of the land while also recognising, as the Deputy has rightly highlighted, the importance of the older farmer to the enterprise with the knowledge and experience on which you really cannot put a price.

I agree with all of the points made about the succession scheme.  Earlier the Chair also mentioned how important it is that the older generation feel comfortable and confident enough to pass on the farm to the next generation.<\/p> <p>  Last Friday, we had our national conference and Mr. Declan McEvoy of IFAC Accountants made good points on what happens on farms.  As Mr. Keane mentioned, there is a succession scheme.  Obviously there must be a transitional period beforehand.  The whole area around a conversation and communicating about a succession scheme between the parents and their child or whoever is going to inherit the farm must happen early.  That communication is nearly the biggest barrier and in a lot of cases, such communication does not happen soon enough.  It is by starting that conversation that you can get the ball rolling and then look at gradually transferring the land.<\/p> <p>  As for the early retirement scheme, the name of the scheme was probably the biggest mistake as everyone knows that farmers do not retire and they definitely do not retire early.  I think that the older generation still must be involved in farming.  While there is a fear that the older generation will still have control and will not hand over enough responsibility, it is important to strike the right balance because farming requires experience, youth and education.  Once things are done in a transitional way, then the farm succession partnership model is one that can be built on.  Mr. Declan McEvoy mentioned points on a possible top-up in that regard as well and I think that is the approach that has to be taken.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general comment on generational renewal, why numbers are so low and why it is going in the wrong direction.  You need to put yourself in young farmers' shoes - and those of all farmers - and the problem is there is so much uncertainty about the future.  The goalposts are changing the whole time between carbon budgets, nitrates and everything else.  As things are constantly changing every week or two, young farmers find it very hard to plan ahead.  It is very hard to entice young people to join the industry when there is so much uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy has been mentioned.  In terms of the eco-schemes, we welcome the new proposal that is on the table but the original five proposals were all about reduction.  There was nothing really there for progressive and highly educated farmers and when young farmers see that it is not going to entice them into the industry, which is the biggest concern.  A lot of farms all over the country do not provide enough income to support two farm families, which again is not going to encourage generational renewal.<\/p> <p>  It is important to have a clearly defined roadmap for farmers and young farmers in general.  Mr. Keane has already mentioned access to credit, which is a huge barrier for young farmers.  You cannot put a plan in place if you do not know the number of livestock or land area involved.  How can you get finance from the banks if you do not have these projections?  We must plan from year to year and there is no other industry that does that.  I mean everyone else can plan for five or ten years ahead.  Farmers need to have a clearly defined roadmap, need more certainty and need to be supported.<\/p> <p>  As we have constantly stated, young farmers will step up to the plate to tackle environmental challenges and meet targets.  At the moment, we know that we probably can only get to approximately 18% by adopting new technologies such as low-emission slurry spreading and using multiple species of clover.  We rely on research or a silver bullet to come along to reach 22% or 30% because if we do not then there will have to be reductions.  It is important that there is funding and support for Teagasc and for research, that people are educated and that young farmers are supported because we are the ones who are going to adapt to the changes faster and we need to be supported to make these changes.  If young farmers do not join the industry then we do not have a hope of meeting these targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Well said.

A number of young farmers have told us that they have been refused access to credit up to ten times and were eventually successful.  The issues they have clearly identified as barriers are as follows.  First, the pillar banks will seek a proven track record in terms of repayment capacity.  The second thing they seek is collateral or security.  We find that young farmers, naturally enough as they are in the early stage of business, have limited collateral or security to put against a loan for investment in capital infrastructure, livestock, land purchase or whatever.  There is a limited capacity and limited security that can be offered in terms of securing finance. <\/p> <p>  I will outline what young farmers have consistently told us in terms of access to credit.  This follows on from what Mr. Fitzgerald said.  Particularly in the last 12 to 18 months, there has been uncertainty regarding the value of product in terms of what will be achieved from it, as well as the future propositions for the sector in terms of meeting the climate targets and climate ambitions the sector hopes to achieve and which Mr. Fitzgerald has touched on.  The feedback is that the security, certainty and confidence in the ability of a young person, who is, naturally enough, more exposed to fluctuations in the market given his or her position in it and who would find it difficult to meet that repayment capacity, is proving to be a challenge.  That whole area of future certainty and of ensuring there is a value in a product and that the value will be received, as well as the budgeting based on that, is proving to be a challenge.  If you look at the dairy side of things, there is processor uncertainty.  In the beef sector, there is uncertainty around price and in particular around the whole emissions piece, how that will be calculated and the talk about what the national herd will look like in the future.  Action 3.1 in the climate action plan refers to developing a sustainable herd as we move forward but there is no clarity or certainty yet around what that will look like.  That does not provide an environment for certainty on which to base lending or to provide a solid business plan for a young farmer as he or she moves forward because there is no guarantee that the goalposts will not move.  The Ag Climatise roadmap that we developed in 2019 has now been put in the parking lot and we are looking at developing something else in early 2022.  We recognise that change is important and good but at the same time, you need a roadmap for young farmers. <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Dillon, will comment on the solution piece.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Carthy, we have spoken about succession schemes and particular sectors that are challenged whether that is access to credit or availing of other incentives.

We talked about succession earlier.  For sectors that are not incentivised enough by taxation measures - we all know which ones we are talking about - there is an opportunity to tweak existing taxation schemes to make them more attractive to those sectors.<br\/><br\/>Moving to sectors where young farmers have difficulty accessing credit, a report published by Indecon in 2016 was an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation of the use of financial instruments within Ireland's rural development programme at the time.  It identified a market failure to the tune of &euro;105 million in 2016, increasing to &euro;350 million over the 2020s.  A particular group, namely, young farmers, had been experiencing market failure when trying to access credit, particularly within the pillar banks.  A recommendation Indecon made related to the use of financial instruments within the rural development programme.  We have sought that, at a minimum, they would be piloted among young farmers within this rural development programme.<br\/><br\/>This is not new from Macra na Feirme; we sought it in the case of the current development programme.  We cannot see any other solid mechanism, allowed under state aid rules, that would provide for young farmers to be able to access credit outside of financial instruments.  Financial instruments are made available through the rural development programme.  It is an revolving fund that is available and that is self-financing over time.  It supports farmers who experience market failure in accessing credit to be able to avail of investment supports within their sector and to grow and drive their business, naturally on a solid business case, which is still a requirement in the context of financial instruments.  Financial instruments constitute the premise of what we are considering, given that they are allowed under the rural development programme, whereas the other mechanism we examined is not allowed under current state aid rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derrie Dillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am, and always have been, impressed by Mr. Keane and the Macra na Feirme organisation.  Young farmers are in really good hands with the likes of him and his team, and I do not say that in any other way than that which I mean.  They are professional, slick and progressive and are on the message and on the money.  That is not just me saying that; other people have said it to me.  I know from the level of contributions they have made, having engaged with this committee since I have been a member, that they are highly focused and professional and they make really good presentations.  I want them to convey that to their broader executive because it is an important vote of confidence.  It is something I have observed within their organisation and it is worth saying.<\/p> <p>  I took the time earlier to print and examine their draft submissions to the CAP strategic plan 2023-2027 and I noted the professional nature of the document, how it is laid out, the objectives, the key messages and the summaries.  It is slick and professional and it is really good for young farmers that they have people who are advocating so strongly for them.<\/p> <p>  I read Macra na Feirme's statement to the committee, which was submitted and circulated earlier.  We have taken on board, and it has been well covered by Deputy Carthy, the issue of succession pathways, the land mobility services, the forgotten farmers, who are a particularly important cohort, the financial instruments and supports, the start-up grants and the eco systems, which I will focus on for a moment because they are important.  There is much talk about them and there is support for them not only in Europe, in the context of the European Green Deal, and nationally among the tripartite coalition Government.  The reality is that the Green Party is in power and it is an advocate.  There is very much a green agenda - I say that in a positive way - among the Government and we need to tap into and maximise the potential and supports for that.<\/p> <p>  There are the seven strands of eco-schemes.  I do not need to set that out for our guests, given they are at that business every day and know it well.  In their submission, the witnesses state they would like to see further increases in the integrated hedgerow management measure, and I fully agree with and support that.  We have not quite seen that in CAP.  Good hedgerow management should be a key feature of CAP and it is something I would like our guests to tease out in more detail.  It makes absolute sense.  There have been big issues with carbon research and all those areas, and it is a hot topic.  Will our guests tease that out?<\/p> <p>  The reduction of the age of first calving is a reasonable request and it makes sense.  As for the increased number of days of pasture, we have an ideal climate, and for many farmers who outwinter cattle or who could do so for a longer period, that would also make sense and would be good news for them.  I have said so many times at meetings of this committee that I know sections of the west of Ireland where cattle are outwintered all year round successfully and they are in top condition.  They do not call many vets and their cattle are sought after.  They would not call themselves organic farmers but rather practical farmers, and they have developed a system that works for them.  While there might be some controversy about ring feeders, moving around the ground, inspectors and so on, they are successful at what they do.  They manage it well and they have healthy systems.<\/p> <p>  How can we tease out these eco systems and maximise them?  How can we tap in and recognise that farmers are both custodians of the land and business people?  Sometimes people forget that, but it is right and there is a natural synergy between them.  What more can we do in the context of good hedgerow management?  In the hedgerow appraisal system, a survey was carried out by Neil Foulkes, Janice Fuller and Declan Little, with whom our guests may be familiar.  There is much substance in what they say.  The eco systems are the way to go but how can we maximise that?<\/p> <p>  Finally, in the context of the CAP strategic plan, our guests spoke about agriculture initiatives such as further training, innovation and learning modules for young farmers, particularly in a practical way, given that many young farmers work on the farm too.  How is that done in such a way that works around their ability to work and farm?  Are there new initiatives or models in that area our guests would like us to pursue?<\/p> <p>  I thank them for their presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#E00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his kind remarks.  I will direct them to Ms Gillian Richardson, who is attending remotely.  He spoke about professionalism and the slickness of the documents, and I assure him she is almost the sole person responsible for that and she puts in a great deal of effort to it.  I pass all those kudos, therefore, to Ms Richardson.<\/p> <p>  On hedgerow management, I might bring in Mr. Fitzgerald.  The Senator referred to pastures and the age of calving.  Hedgerow management is critical and is even called out in an advisory document from the EU about developing our CAP strategic plan, whereby Ireland benefits and has the advantages of one of the highest shares of farmland given away to permanent grassland but which also has a well-established network of hedgerows that support rich biodiversity and its protection and enhancement, which is important.  Our network of hedgerows averages in the region of 7% or 8% of the coverage across the country in terms of area.<\/p><p>From a management point of view, we recognise the importance to nature of ensuring hedgerows provide a biodiverse rich nature for habitats, creatures, insects and nesting birds.  That is part of what we need to deliver under the CAP.  It is not about reinventing the wheel.  We have hedgerows on every farm across the country.  Therefore, why would we not use them to our benefit and to provide an opportunity for habitats, biodiversity and all of that development? <\/p><p> Moving on specifically to what we are looking for, the Senator mentioned the document and reference was made to some of the research.  The research indicates a hedgerow which is 2.5 m to 3 m wide at the bottom and between 1.5 m to 2 m wide at the top is the most beneficial, secure and provides the most opportunity for nesting birds, biodiversity and habitat development.  If we are to develop a scheme it should enhance the value of develop hedgerows towards those measurements.  The geotagging app has been used for on-farm measurements.  Farmers provide those data and they can be marked on a map, as well as where a photograph was taken.  Those are measures that can be used to monitor and develop a progression model for hedgerow development over a number of years.  We recognise some of the other measures within eco-schemes, whether it be the planting of trees or hedgerows, can be knitted within this measure to improve the overall biodiversity benefit of hedgerows across farms.  We recognise that is a crucial way to move forward.  Integrated management policy is a gap within those eco-schemes.  The Department has highlighted eco-schemes are open to all farmers and there is an opportunity for them to access them.  Integrated hedgerow management is a measure that can be adopted by almost every farmer, if not all farmers, across the country and it can provide a benefit to the farmer, shelter for animals, a habitat and a biodiverse rich nature for nature on farms. <\/p><p> We have mentioned the age of calving, faecal egg sampling and milk recording.  We recognise their benefit and have suggested their use to the Department.  The feedback has been that, from an environmental point of view, they are quite sector-specific in terms of milk recording.  However, with respect to faecal egg sampling and milk recording in the context of antimicrobial resistance and looking to the farm to fork strategy - around which policy is being developed as we speak at European level that will come into effect in the next few years - and the reduction targets around that, and it being called out as one of the seven measures which can be used within eco-schemes, as required by the European Commission from which the Government can select, it would be a missed opportunity not to use those, partly because it can benefit antimicrobial resistant targets at an EU and farm-to-fork level, which will be translated to Government level, and, from a farmer's point of view, it can be used as a practical tool to reduce the antibiotics usage on farms, ensure more appropriate use of them such that they can be specifically targeted when needed.  That can provide benefits for the environment and animals and it would enhance our reputation as a sector on the international scene from a market point of view.  The figures indicate Irish farmers are already among the best in Europe on our antibiotic usage.  We are leaders on it.  Our application of them is less than half the EU average.  Those are measures that would further develop and enhance that reputation, while also providing benefits to the environment, animal welfare and meet our objectives under the farm to fork strategy.  This would be a benefit for all sectors.<\/p><p> Extended grazing has been called out in a Commission communication to our Department.  We have seen the average grazing period of animals across the Europe Union, depending on the member state, ranges from zero up to 80 or 90 days.  We are a complete outlier in having a grazing period of 190 to 210 days.  As progressive young farmers, we are driving the environmental benefits of extended grazing.  Teagasc studies and research on the sector's climate contributions and the emissions profile when animals are out at grass show that emissions are significantly decreased when animals graze outside versus when they are housed.  That is related to the make-up of their diet.  Freshly grazed forage cover from grass at a low cover, which many young farmers are doing, reduces methane output, and the emissions profile of those animals.  Why would we not seek extended grazing or a days-at-grass measure as a key component of an eco-scheme?  Given the nature of our enterprises and our livestock sector and the green image we portray across the world, which is reflected in what we do, outdoor grazing of beef animals or dairy cattle benefits the environment in respect of their emissions profile, it benefits animal welfare and it drives on-farm profitability in ensuring, most importantly, as touched on by Mr. Fitzgerald, that our sector remains viable into the future.  Mr. Fitzgerald might comment on that also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Mr. Keane might also comment on agri-training for young farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#F00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I might comment on that after Mr. Fitzgerald deals with the other point.

I am a dairy farmer with 200 cows in Waterford.  Some people would call that an intensive farm but there is no such thing as an intensive farm in this country.  Some people would lead one to believe that having more than 100 cows constitutes intensive farming.  We have had our cows out full-time, day and night, and they were only been brought in today.  That has been of major benefit to ourselves and the environment.  Very little slurry was produced and we have not had to buy any feed.  It is very efficient and we are self-sufficient.  We have a unique and competitive advantage in this country.  Young farmers are educated.  We are all measuring grass and can utilise it to the best of its ability.  In other countries such as Holland, farmers are paid a bonus for their milk for having cows outdoors for 60 days.  In the UK they get paid a bonus for having them outdoors for 120 days.  Mr. Keane mentioned we have cows outdoors for an average of 190 to 200 days. Why can an eco-scheme not be developed to encourage farmers to graze cows outdoors for up to 250 days or to add an additional days to what they had in previous years?  That could be monitored through Bord Bia.  That is recorded there.  There are ways of doing that.  Having extended grazing is a low- hanging fruit.  It would be a win-win for the farmer and for the environment.  It is definitely a measure that should not be overlooked.<\/p> <p>  Briefly, on hedgerow management and the habitat area, there are four principles with respect to hedgerow management, namely, maintain, retain, enhance and create.  First, we have to maintain and retain what we already have.  That is a key point.  It is great for people to set new hedgerows and that is important but there is no point in planting new hedgerows if you do not maintain those they already have.  That is what happened with previous schemes such as the action-based schemes like the green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, where new hedgerows were planted but the old hedgerows were being managed in a box shape.  They were cut very low and narrow, which was not good for birds, insects or wildlife.  It is important they are managed properly.  Farmers in derogation are doing certain things already.  They are leaving hawthorn trees every 300 m, they are cutting hedgerows on a three-year cycle or cutting a third of the farm every year.  Why can every farmer not do that?  That would be simple to do.  That is an important point.  Hedgerow management needs to improve.  We all see hedgerows that are cut too tight and that is not good for biodiversity.  We have the infrastructure already in place for wildlife; we just need to look after it better.  Introducing an eco-scheme is the perfect way to do that.  Mr. Keane mentioned the other points raised and I will not go into them.<\/p> <p>  On efficiency with respect to the age of first calving, milk recording and faecal sampling, there needs to be more for productive and efficient farmers in eco-schemes.  We cannot have them all geared towards reduction, particularly for young farmers.  We want to be as efficient as we can be to protect our future.  It is important eco-schemes also incorporate some of those more efficient measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Keane want to address the other point Senator Boyhan made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#F00600","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Yes.  On the Senator's question on training modules for farmers and what that looks like, this is not something new for Macra na Feirme.  We conducted research on this in 2015 to 2016 and the Broadmore report was produced by the late Pat Bogue in 2017 on what a continuous professional development, CPD, framework looks like for the agricultural sector.  That is a whole-of-sector approach to developing a CPD framework that delivers for farmers.  We have had that constantly on the agenda for the past three or four years with little movement in getting it developed, bringing the CPD framework into the limelight and having it as an approval system for farmers as they develop.  We should compliment farmers on being very good at what they do but if they were in any other profession, they would have to maintain a certain number of credits or points over three or four years, or whatever it might be.<\/p><p>It offers an opportunity for farmers to get the credit for the training modules they are doing.  They could be on-farm safety, grass production, nutrient management or soil management modules.  Farmers are already actively engaged with all of these things.  It is through such an overall arching framework that we see the development of a training framework for farmers.  We have some offerings where a CPD stamp is put on training modules for farmers when there is no accreditation or verification system and no overall framework for that.  We recognise that within different organisations, our own included, our Skillnet programme has a huge role to play in providing training for farmers and non-farmers alike.  That could be the practical application of farming through the likes of our dairy, artificial insemination, AI, freeze branding or other such practical courses or leadership development, dairy engagement or grassland-based modules.<\/p><p> That is where we see it coming from but there has to be an overall framework in which to develop that.  We have engaged with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Heydon, on it and there has been progress and discussions on it in recent months.  We need that stakeholder group to be set up to oversee the establishment and verification of that.  Macra na Feirme does not want ownership of this and we recognise that other organisations and institutions such as Teagasc have a huge amount to contribute.

Mr. Keane says that 4,000 of 8,700 applicants received the last young farmers scheme payment in 2019, even though many still qualified for it due to the five-year rule.

When we are dealing with it in reality, if you look back to 2014 when the previous CAP was due to expire and the current CAP was due to start, in 2015 there was an increase in the number of young farmers who took up the young farmers scheme and who accessed the national reserve that year because of negotiations and the uncertainty around where the ball would land with it.  We anticipate, as does the Department, that in 2023 there will be some bounce from that also.  I refer to getting more young farmers into that scheme and into the national reserve and what that should look like.  I know the Deputy touched on the five-year rule and we have made contributions to the Department on the extension of same up towards seven years because the reality is that there is a short window in which to draw the funding down.  I might come back to that point later.<\/p> <p>  The number of people entering Teagasc colleges and doing farming-related modules has never been higher than it has been in recent years and that is a credit to the education that is being provided there.  We need to see a follow-through from that education to active young farmers on the ground doing that.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not do that and there is no single measure or silver bullet that will resolve it.  We see addressing those barriers we touched on earlier as the key.  A fully funded national reserve, which we currently have in the draft, is crucially important to that.  The barriers for people starting off in their careers also must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Dillon touched on, those are finance, land and the start-up or installation aid.  That initial boost of capital is crucially important because young farmers are coming back to us and saying that if they are drawing down the investment support under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, at the 60% rate that currently is in place, given the increase in the overall cost of inputs over the past 12 months that we have seen, that 60% represents somewhere more in the region of between 38% and 45% of the overall cost of the investment.  Young farmers do not have the financial capacity to meet that balance, whether that be 40% or 60% of the total cost.  They do not have the financial power or backing to do that.  What is happening is that the necessary development at farm level, whether that be in infrastructure, buildings, livestock, grassland or grazing, is needed by a young farmer in order to provide a lifestyle and an income.  If someone starting out is not able to do that then it becomes an onerous and arduous job because he or she does not have the right facilities, tools or grazing infrastructure and it makes the job difficult.  It is a turn-off for young farmers when they have entered the job.  During the initial two-year period when someone starts out in their career in farming, that start-up and installation aid is providing for that gap in finance, which leaves young farmers the ability to invest in the newest technologies and research that return income and make the lifestyle on the farm easier because those facilities are more amenable to shorter and more productive working hours and reduced labour intensity on the farm.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues will resolve that as opposed to a one-size-fits all approach.

This was needed and Macra na Feirme&rsquo;s initiative has proven to be successful in respect of the level of buy-in to the service.

I understand that Macra na Feirme has been developing links across the EU with a view to expanding it, given that the figures for 2017 showed that 31% of all farmers in the EU were older than 65 and only 5.6% of all European farms were run by farmers under the age of 35.  How are those efforts progressing?  Does Macra na Feirme foresee itself having to adapt the service further to deal with the current transition that farms are undergoing in respect of environmental demands?

On the land mobility service, we have received Department funding for a number of years and that has been increased to &euro;100,000, which the Deputy probably saw last week.  That is welcome and much appreciated.  The service has a footprint and there is support for it through a number of the dairy co-operatives.  That footprint is based around where that support is coming from geographically.  There are areas of the country, be it in the south, the south west or the west, where the service has a limited capacity because the funding is not in place to provide a full service for it.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the CAP, the Deputy is right that our partners in the European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, were instrumental in driving that narrative at Commission and European level for this proven service facilitating land transfer and land mobility in Ireland.<\/p><p>It was adopted into the Commission's proposals as an example of how a land mobility service can work across member states and the European Union.  Through our CEJA context, we have had a number of engagements with our partners in other EU member states on how the service works and what it looks like on a practical basis on the ground.  What we have not seen in the context of our own CAP strategic plan is a long-term sustainable funding element for the land mobility service.  If we are building a service for three to five years, we need to build on what is there in terms of the financial contribution from the Department and we need to develop that on a wider geographical footprint such that we can offer a service across the country as opposed to what is being offered now, which is a footprint across different areas of the country.  If somebody from an area not covered by the service calls on the service he or she is facilitated but there is not a focus in those areas.  We need sustainable funding over a three to five-year period which, essentially, is over the course of the next CAP and ring-fenced funds for the development of a service like this so that we can ensure there is a geographical footprint, as well as a service that matches it.  The feedback from Mr. Austin Finn, the lead person within the land mobility service with over 700 arrangements done at this stage, is that the service can develop both in terms of what we are doing now, that is, developing partnerships, land mobility transfers and share arrangements within farm and that there also is a need for a piece to complement the succession scheme we have proposed, in terms of the conversations that happen around kitchen tables countrywide with farmers, to provide an independent service for mediating that to ensure that both aspects are properly accounted for.  That part of the service will be critical in terms of moving the succession piece forward and having more young farmers under the age of 35 actively farming.  I will ask Mr. Dillon to contribute further on that as I know he is very involved with the intricacies of it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>There are a number of elements to it.

I will try not to plough the same ground, if you will excuse the farming cliche.  I want to hone in on the land mobility service.  To give the president a break, I will direct this question to Mr. Dillon.<\/p> <p>  We know that succession is not an exclusively Irish issue and that it is an issue right across Europe.  Let us call a spade a spade: farming as a career is not the most attractive option.  As rightly stated, under the land mobility service approximately 700 arrangements for 140 farms were put in place in 2020.  The scheme has, undoubtedly, been very successful.  It was mentioned that there are 30,000 farm families.  One of the challenges to date in terms of the mobility service is that success has been very much regionalised.  If one is to be truthful that is because the most - I am loath to say profitable - viable farms are in those regions.  If one goes to the west, it is a harder sell.  In terms of the research, we know that some of those 30,000 farms will never come up with succession plans.  Realistically, what are the numbers for, say, the next five years?  Assuming &euro;1.5 million in funding is secured, based on the current numbers and what we see in terms of profitability, how many of those farms will transition to the next generation?  We are seeing large-scale acquisition of lands as well.   I ask Mr. Dillon to set out what would happen to the landscape if the &euro;1.5 million came into play.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#H00900","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>As stated by the Deputy, there are many variables and many challenges, including cultural challenges.  We see that across European countries.  There are some things that need to align as well to help us.  I mentioned an alignment around the taxation code and schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy.  They are important as well.  The succession partnership which we mentioned earlier is more attractive to the profitable sectors because there is a tax credit per annum.  For sectors that do not have a significant taxable income, the schemes are not as attractive, but that is not to say they cannot be.  With some adjustments, they can be also attractive to those sectors.  That would help on the journey.<\/p> <p>  On the figures, our ambition is to have an average 100 arrangements per facilitator.  There will be many inquiries, perhaps in the range of 500 to 700 per facilitator.  Our ambition is to take on 12 facilitators to cover the country.  Each facilitator could potentially receive up to 750 inquiries, which will then be distilled into the region of 500 practical or measurable engagements, leading to, we would hope, a final outcome of in the region of 100 to 150 arrangements per facilitator per annum.

That is the main reason that has been used.  Some of the reasons used for some of the other proposed eco-scheme options not being taken on board is that they are not as easily inspected or monitored and the administration burden on the Department can be a bit high.  That seems to be the main reason to go against some eco-schemes.  The Department seems to be looking for simple schemes that could be monitored easily.  A lot of them seem to be around land use as well, so that is the reason it is going for such options as the planting of trees, extensive livestock production and fertilisers.  It is not just us, everyone has pushed for milk recording.  Faecal sampling has been mentioned previously and it was included in Ag Climatise to push the antimicrobial side of things.  The Department is probably looking at it from the environmental side and we are trying to come at it from a different perspective as regards antimicrobial resistance.  It does not seem to be something the Department is too happy with at the moment.  Young farmers want to try to encourage more efficient measures to support and facilitate more progressive young farmers.  The likes of these measures are more efficient and avoid wastage but the Department is probably worried about how it would monitor these type of arrangements.  That is where some of these proposals could fall down.

I have one last question, which I will direct to Mr. Keane.  This committee spends a lot of time discussing forestry.  Notwithstanding the challenges in the sector currently, it is probably not hot on the agenda of young farmers.  Traditionally, it is older farmers who go into forestry.  What is the feeling among young farmers on forestry?  Given the issues evident in the sector currently, is it something they are going to avoid or that they will embrace if the seemingly insurmountable issues within the sector can be resolved by the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#J01600","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I have two quick points to make in response to other questions, but I will make them at the end.  Young farmers right now do not see forestry as being a viable opportunity for them, based on the roadblocks that are there, the issues with felling licences and thinning licences.  It comes back to the initial point both Mr. Fitzgerald and I made, which is that certainty into the future is not there for them at the moment.  The number of planting licences this year was reduced and the amount of planting was far below the target of 11,000 ha.  Young farmers are not being provided with certainty at the moment.  It is very much a long-term commitment and investment to put an acre or hectare of ground into forestry.  The current issues could potentially be resolved but it does not provide certainty for young farmers to invest in it as an opportunity.  There is not proving to be a huge appetite for it among our members.  The numbers on both of those fronts would suggest the same as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of land mobility, there is an important piece on it too in terms of the service.  I acknowledge the Minister's comments last week on the role Teagasc and Macra na Feirme will hopefully play together in the coming year or so in terms of the development of the service.  Mr. Dillon touched on the numbers with Deputy Flaherty.  In terms of the development of the relationship and the integration of Teagasc as part of the expansion of the service, there is an opportunity for resources to be aligned and shared.  It involves both education and the provision of a knowledge transfer piece around succession and what the arrangements look like.  In time, you would hope that would drive both the enthusiasm, engagement and need towards a service like the land mobility service.  It is probably a good idea to look at it in terms of its own sphere and what can be delivered on that front.  The multiplier effect of having an organisation and development agency like Teagasc involved as part of the development of the service in the coming years will grow it and develop it and provide a resource piece as well in terms of how we can ensure that the demand is met, should that piece be increased.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the eco-schemes and the antimicrobial resistance piece, part of the feedback relates to how we monitor whether there is a benefit to the antimicrobial resistance piece and the use of antibiotics, as well as the animal welfare piece.<\/p><p>That is the feedback we have got from the Department but from our end, the answers are pretty much straightforward.  We know our average figures for antibiotic usage and our laboratory capacity and throughput of faecal egg sampling.  It is about the implication and monitoring of that on-farm, if we do so through the likes of Bord Bia and our Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, programmes, and having the tools in place to monitor and measure that.  Those are pretty much a win-win for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in to us.

I noticed in the witnesses' submission and I have heard them speak about it previously, a facility through the EU, perhaps a loan facility, for young farmers starting off.  One of the witnesses said he had 200 cows.  The guts of 300 acres are needed for 200 cows.  The average application to the single farm payments is 32 ha, which is 70 or 80 acres.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses whether there is a problem throughout the country in that no more land is being made, to put it very simply.  There is no point in saying there is and we cannot make any more than what is there.  Farms are getting bigger and bigger.  There are parts of the country in which one cannot take land at the price for which it is being sold.  If that continues, fewer farmers will be involved, because land is not available or some farms are getting bigger and bigger, while more are not able to get the facility, depending on the farming they are doing.  I ask the witnesses how we counteract that problem.<\/p> <p>  I was surprised when the witnesses said they welcomed the 90 ha limit being removed from young farmers, because 90 ha is 225 acres, compared to the average 32 ha single farm payment application.  Everyone welcomes the removal of an off-farm income limit.  However, were we not better using the percentage of money going into the pot to help the young farmers starting off by raising the money in the young farmers scheme, for the five-year period, rather than going for more hectares, in order to give more money to more youngsters on less land?  Was that not a better system?<\/p> <p>  As someone who is a farming contractor, if one had a big tractor years ago in 1990 or 1991, such as a Deutz-Fahr tractor, it was like a Rolls Royce pulling up and every youngster in the country wanted to drive it.

A target of 15% of young farmers being under the age of 35, based on the 130,000 farmers, would equate to 19,500 farmers and 20% would be 26,000 farmers.  One is looking at those kinds of numbers coming through agricultural colleges into farming in the coming years to get our percentages up.  That is where we need to set the benchmark.<\/p> <p>  As for the Deputy's question on the bigger farmers getting bigger and smaller farmers going out of business, we absolutely share that concern.  While we are dealing with CAP today, the Vice Chairman might allow me to digress briefly.  The whole suite of policy measures being proposed, such as in respect of the nitrates directive currently being put forward or the increase in output per livestock unit, will only increase the demand for land.  We are coming from a young person's point of view and this concerns all sectors.  Our members who come forward from lower-income sectors, in particular, highlight to us that they simply cannot compete because the measures are not there to support them into the sector.  The measures are not there to establish, because in order to do so you will need somebody's support to get into it to generate an income or the agri-taxation reliefs are not there to meet the requirement on a young farmer starting out.  The measures for access to finance have to be number one and the second measure for access to land and ensuring that young farmers have that support is the most crucial part in terms of addressing that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on the 90 ha for young farmers is in the context of the young farmers scheme and the removal of the &euro;40,000 limit on off-farm income.

Similarly, a funding allocation has not been set aside within any of the proposals or the documentation released by the Minister.  I find it difficult to believe, therefore, that within the context of the CAP as it stands, with both the wording and the financial allocation, and given the Department and the Minister have stated no more money will be found, the Department could say it will be dealt with in the context of the current CAP, unless there is something that will be imminently released that we are not aware of.  That is our currently position on forgotten farmers.<\/p> <p>  We would not accept that a number of forgotten farmers would not be supported by whatever measure is brought in to support them.  All those people who are now farmers were young farmers when, through no fault of their own, they fell through the system.  It does not matter whether they were 34 years old at the time and they are now in their mid-40s, or whether they were 21 years old at the time and are still young farmers.  They were left out at that time and, therefore, they should all be treated equally.<\/p> <p>  On eco-schemes, we believe that from a productive point of view there is an opportunity, among the schemes we have measured such the additional days at grass, the antimicrobial resistance piece and the hedgerow management, that all farmers can access.  There is the wider question from a farming perspective of practical application on the ground.  When the suite of measures contained in the agri-environment climate measures, AECM, under Pillar 2, for the general measure of 30,000 farmers, is compared with the number of eco-schemes, a number of measures under the AECM under Pillar 2 under the general measure contain a higher payment rate than those measures contained in the eco-scheme under Pillar 1.<\/p> <p>  From a practical farmer's point of view, why would he or she not access the measures under the AECM under Pillar 2, get a higher rate of payment and forgo those eco-schemes under Pillar 1 because the payment rate is lower?  That is why we need to see an increase in the number of schemes that diverge from those proposed under the general measures under the AECM in Pillar 2.  We fully recognise the AECM has a limit of 30,000 farmers under the general measure, which we think is not enough, but from a practical sense we need farmers to have measures under eco-schemes they can access that are notably different from those under the measures in the general eco-scheme under Pillar 2, given that the higher rate of payment is contained in Pillar 2.  At the same time, we need farmers to be able to draw down the &euro;74 per hectare payment under Pillar 1, if 85% of farmers took up the schemes.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>What is Macra na Feirme's view on mixed-species swards?

On mixed species, we would welcome the sentiment of the biodiversity element, the carbon element and the production in terms of livestock.  When we look to research and practical implications from an on-farm point of view, we see that some of the herbs contained in some of the mixed-species swards currently out there, such as chicory or plantain, do not survive for more than two years under current grazing conditions, and that is with the help of research and on some of the best farms implementing best practices.<\/p> <p>  Our concern is that if we set the bar at six or seven species in the sward and the farmer has 6% of his or her area under the mixed-species sward, when there is an inspection in year 3 or whenever, the six species may not be in the sward through no fault of the farmer but because the herbs, such as chicory, plantain or whatever it might be, have not survived for longer than two or three years.  There is an element of that uncertainty regarding the mixed-species sward and its persistence over a number of years, particularly in the context of grazing.<\/p> <p>  There are also implications from some of the research, as well as some practical implications that our members have raised regarding mixed species on farms, that in wetter conditions the poaching element is not as durable as grassland species on wetter soils, so on wetter days it is not possible to graze.  Again, the herbs and so forth will die out of the sward, and the early spring and late autumn management is particularly weather dependent as well.  There are a number of elements concerning what mixed-species swards offer for farmers, and research will, I hope, develop over the coming years.  We recognise the role clover has to play in mixed-species swards, in terms of reducing nitrogen, increased protein in the diet and a reduced reliance on forage or imported feed.  There are also benefits from reduced nitrogen and the environmental impact from that.  From a clover point of view in a perennial ryegrass sward, the benefits and the science are shown.<\/p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Fitzgerald to respond to the questions on soil sampling and liming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Soil liming, like multispecies swards, is positive.

If nitrogen has to be reduced on farms and it is done in an efficient way, everything will be okay.  It will save farmers money and the environment will benefit as well.  The problem is that if farmers reduce nitrogen too fast and do not have the appropriate tools in place to mitigate that, it could lead to a higher carbon footprint with more damage to the environment.  By having a reduced feed on the farm, the farmer will not be as self-sufficient and will end up having to buy in more fodder and having more imported feed, which will have a knock-on effect on the financial side of things for the farmer.  The likes of soil sampling and multispecies swards are positive, although there are question marks, as Mr. Keane outlined, over the persistence of multispecies.  Soil sampling can be chosen only once every three years.  We are big advocates for it and the majority of young farmers soil-sample every year, as do farmers in derogation.  That is something we asked for at the start.  The same is true of liming.  Anything that will improve soil health has to be prioritised.

I might ask Ms Richardson to give a piece in terms of the future aspects of them.  We touched on some of them as well but some of our other proposals are on additions.<\/p> <p>  As for the eco-schemes that are there right now, Mr. Fitzgerald touched on some of them.  In the case of the productive farmer, that is, the efficiency farmer which young farmers are absolutely trying to be, if you look at the non-productive areas proposal, whether that be 7% or otherwise, or the extensive livestock proposal in terms of 95 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare - which in money terms at the moment is a suckler cow and a calf - or if you look at the current tree planting measures, while some of them might be beneficial to the environment, they are reductive measures in terms of the area of ground that is available for farmers and for young farmers, in particular.  To follow on from Deputy Fitzmaurice's point, it is important in the context of how no more land is being made.  In addition, from the point of view of our productive and efficient farmers across both livestock enterprises and others, it is proving to be a challenge to meet the obligations under that.  <\/p> <p>  When it comes to the fertiliser application piece and the GPS controlled fertiliser piece, there is no getting away from the fact it is a significant investment for farmers in the order of approximately &euro;25,000 to invest in a load-sensing weight cell piece of machinery for spreading fertiliser.  Practically, that is not something the majority of farmers will do.  There will be reliance on contractors to do that if that measure is selected.  Similar to when the low-emissions slurry spreading was introduced initially, there is a lack of equipment to meet the potential demand that might be there on foot of the requirement to meet that measure.  In that sense, it is a measure which obviously has environmental benefits in reducing nitrogen, N, input, as Mr. Fitzgerald has touched on.  However, from a practical point of view, there is neither the investment capital nor the investment potential there to meet that demand or to buy that piece of equipment for the majority of farmers. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the N rates, we recognise the menu in this regard has increased of those over the past week or so with the Department releasing the figures in respect of the stocking rate and the relatability to the output of N.  This has been warmly received by our members.  It offers an opportunity for farmers to reduce their input while meeting their forage demands through better use of fertilisers, increasing the amount of clover in swards and other environmental practices.  Therefore, that has been positively received. <\/p> <p>  On the measures that we hope will be included, I welcome the Senator's comments, in that we all hope there will be more measures to be included and that they are practical for farmers on the ground.  Ms Richardson will take us through some of the measures which we proposed.

We proposed that the integrated hedgerow management eco-scheme should be included in it.  The majority of farms have hedgerows on them and we would like farmers to improve them, maintain them and increase their number and length.  That would be of benefit to both the farmers themselves and to the eco-schemes within that.  Along with that, we also sought increased days at pasture.  This is something the EU itself has outlined, namely, that Ireland has a high level of days at pasture and this is something that should be encouraged and rewarded.<\/p> <p>  The other one that we were looking at is reduced age at first calving, that is, making sure that the heifers are calving down at a suitable age that is suitable to their weight and age and getting the best out of the animal and for the farmers themselves.

This next point may have been touched on and I do not expect the witnesses to go into it again - just say it has already been dealt with and I will find out about it - but I read recently that a dairy farmer down south had about 150 acres and about 140 cows.  As he said himself, he was not a mad environmentalist, but he had tried the new grass-clover mix.  He found that buying the fertiliser, which is at an extraordinary price - and will be at an extraordinary price in 2022; I do not know how farmers will afford it - and the cost of hiring men to put it out was just short of &euro;30,000 each year.  Therefore, he decided to go over to the grass-clover mixes and reduced fertiliser.  This had cut his costs by up to &euro;20,000.  The point he was making was that the yield from the cows was the very same.  In other words, it had not dropped.  Is this the way forward?  I was just listening to the answers that came on screen.  Is there a difficulty with those mixes in the west, north west or midlands, where a lot of the land is just is not as good?  It might only work well on better grounds.  As I do not know, I am asking for Mr. Keane's opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#M00400","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question.  In terms of the research, which is where I would point, the Senator is absolutely right.  The research that has been done in both Clonakilty and by Teagasc in Moorepark on the clover swards shows it absolutely has a benefit to reducing N input when managed appropriately with the techniques that I am sure the farmer the Senator mentioned is putting in place.  There is no reduction in the output of the sward or the production over the course of the year.  There is that management piece, in that early spring growth of clover is quite low, so your mix of species in your sward that you are sowing in has to have an early growth in the spring from a grassland point of view, to make up for the fact that clover starts growing at around 8&deg;C versus grass at around 6&deg;C.  Absolutely, that is part of it.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the Senator's second question in two parts.  I mentioned this in terms of the mixed species swards earlier but it is absolutely apparent in respect of his question as well that in heavier soils, the requirement in terms of a clover mix is definitely more reliant on the different species of grass that you are going to use.  A diploid perennial ryegrass, which has a much thicker, denser rooting base at the ground, mixed with a clover sward, has been shown to have benefits in terms of reduced N as well as productive growth and meeting that requirement.  Therefore, it is an option in terms of heavier soils as well.  My own farm at home has a heavier soil with that kind of mix in it.  It is down to management as well, because obviously it is not going to be as easy to manage as on drier soils.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the mixed species sward which we have touched on, there is work to be done and more research needed on how long the herbs in the current mixes of the multispecies sward persist over a number of years.  We have the reality on farms and what some farmers have found is that some of those herbs will be waning and weakening over the first number of years and maybe non-existent after a two to three-year period within the sward.  Our worry is that if someone is two or three years into the Common Agricultural Policy and has 6% in his or her multispecies sward and an inspection happens on farm.  You are required to have six species in your sward but through no fault of your own, only two or three or four species are all that remain because some of the herbs have naturally just waned in the sward and that could be an issue. <\/p> <p>  For multispecies mixes, different management is required on wetter soils because of damage to the root, whether that be from a wet day or earlier in the spring because ground conditions are a bit more saturated or similarly at the back end of the year, as the recovery of some of the species in the multispecies sward is not the same as that of a perennial ryegrass plant.  There is work to be done around ensuring that the multispecies mix meets the requirement for that and this is why our proposal is around the clover mixes, whether that be red and white clover mixes with perennial ryegrass included, in terms of availability to heavier soils wherever they are in the country, as they are easier to manage.<\/p><p>Even within that clover, red clover, white clover and perennial ryegrass mix, there are benefits to the animal, the environment and the overall footprint in carbon and nitrogen use being reduced.  We still see benefits from a multispecies point of view to that clover inclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I apologise that I had to step out so my question might have been answered already.

On the draft strategic plan we saw on 8 August, the revised one we saw a number of weeks ago and the financial allocation the Minister released at the end of October, there is neither text in the draft strategic plan or a funding allocation within the funding that has been released from the Department to directly address the issue of the forgotten farmers.  That is a fundamental flaw in the context of the CAP because we have seen the commitment from the Minister that they would be dealt with in the next CAP.  The proposal and solution need to be in the context of the CAP because it gives certainty for five years that these farmers, who have been forgotten for 13 or 14 years, will get continuous support, whether that be to top up the low value basic entitlement they have experienced in recent years, to get access to the grant scheme at the 60% rate that they missed out on when they were young farmers or equivalent support from the installation aid that they also missed out on for that period.  There are three or four different measures that are needed for those farmers and that is in the context of their peers before them receiving that support.  Whatever the average of that was from a young farmers scheme point of view, from an installation aid point of view and from a national reserve point of view, that should be equitable to what is being produced now and being supplied to them.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned that some of those forgotten farmers may now be over the age of 40, under the age of 30 or in their early 30s.  That is irrelevant because they were young farmers at the time that cohort of 3,500 of such farmers were negatively impacted by the policy change and the decisions made.  Regardless of their age now, the impact was felt by them a number of years ago and they need to be dealt with as a full cohort, as opposed to divvying out and dividing them up based on their age or whatever they might be doing now.

We are seeking clarification on one area.  There is a scenario developing where a young farmer, male or female, receives investment support at 60% under TAMS when he or she is under 30 for five years.  We have looked for that TAMS support to increase to 80% in line with what the Commission has said has been the upper ceiling for investment support for young farmers.  That is in the context of the entirety of the conversation we have had today around the challenges for young farmers.  There could now be a position where a young female farmer starting out at 21, 22 or even 25 has five years of access to 60% grant aid support until the age of 30 or 31.  I should say this is our current understanding of the situation.  Then there is a ten, 11, 12 or 13-year gap until that female farmer reaches the age of 40 and requalifies for a 60% grant under TAMS and investment support.  It seems like an inequitable and unfair system that there is a period of development in between where the same support is not in place.  We call for all young farmers to receive support for that period of time when they are defined as young farmers.  We are looking for clarity that this scenario would not materialise for young female farmers and that they would continue to receive investment support.

We can have varying interventions and that is important because one has to see role models and ambassadors in the industry to get other female farmers involved.

We need to remove that barrier and get to the nature of what it really is to get to that justice level that Ms Richardson mentioned.<\/p><p>We need to move beyond equality and equity.  It is like putting supports under people to get them all at the same level.  If they are watching a match, for instance, and the barrier in front of them is too high, you can put boxes under them to raise them up.  Putting those supports under people is the same thing we are trying to do in the short term.  We need to do that but we have to take away the fence that is in front of them in order that everybody can see the match.  Therefore, individual supports would not be needed then because everybody would have equal access and parity and justice.  That is what has to be worked at over time.  It is a conundrum.  It is not easy to get a magic solution to this, but we need to look at it in the short, medium and long term.  Where do we want to get to?  What are the barriers?  We need to identify them clearly and get the supports in to start with.  The supports are not the long-term solution; they are only short-term measures.  That is where we are at presently.  That is how we see it from Macra na Feirme's perspective initially.

As Ms Richardson correctly said, three of our main leaders are fantastic women who are great advocates for the organisation.  In the wider sectoral context, we provide role models and the opportunity for women to come forward.  Looking at the 20x20 project in sport, the slogan was \"If she can't see it, she can't be it\".  There is a role and appetite required in order to provide that equal opportunity for young women to come into our sector.  That is at a number of different strands.  As Ms Richardson said, that includes the conversation at the kitchen table around the expectation of what young female farmers or young women in farming enterprises might like to do.<\/p> <p>  It is also around tailoring an education piece that is suitable for young female farmers that meets their needs and identifies those challenges.  We could look, as a sample, at the tractor course that is run in Pallaskenry in conjunction with the Women in Agriculture Stakeholders Group.  There had been excessive demand there from young female farmers and because of that it was specifically provided for them and identified as a weakness.  It is those kinds of initiatives to provide an opportunity of education for young female farmers that we need entering the sector.  Those supports include the knowledge transfer, KT, groups.  Over a period of time, the integration of those KT groups with those strong female representatives into the wider sector to ensure those role models are present within the sector is needed.<\/p> <p>  It comes down to an attitude shift within the sector as well of the role young female farmers can play as we go forward.  We are all acutely aware in farming families across the country of the role of the female in the household - I am referencing my own mother - and the importance those people have within the farming enterprise is invaluable.  It is about that recognition as well and identifying the barriers in the family home.  The succession pathway is one of those issues about which a piece of research into what those is needed.  There are barriers to education and access to education, be they peer pressure or the opinion one's peers might have of entering farming and that it is not a position or a career for X, Y or Z to take up.  Barriers exist within the wider sector, be they within industry, employment issues, issues in terms of organisational development, us included.  What are those barriers that prevent our young female people entering into those?  There are three or four different strands required from a research point of view to help identify those, as well continuing to support and develop them further to break down both the stigma and the issues that exist around succession at family and farm level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021120100002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the president.

They are all very important parts of what Macra na Feirme's ethos is, including farm tasks.  The organisation would traditionally be in the centre of running its competitions at this time.  The pandemic has had a significant impact on the membership.  Will Mr. Keane give us an update on how they have managed over the past 19 months?  Online has been one way but how has the membership, which is quite large, managed both physically and mentally over the past 19 months regarding the lockdown?

I probably would not define him as not being a younger man any more.  I would not ring-fence him to that solely.  In terms of our activities, it absolutely has been a challenge to Macra na Feirme over the past 19 months.  The online element started in March 2020.  The shift to online was a novelty for three or four months but with that appetite -  no more than with any of us on this committee call - Zoom has had a tiring and fatiguing effect, and that was felt throughout the membership for that period of time.  As we started to return to physical activity over the past six or seven months, it has been a slow process for members to come back and engage with the organisation.  We have seen those same concerns expressed by some of our partner organisations in terms of members re-engaging with the organisation.  Thankfully over the past three to four months we have seen a huge increase in appetite in engaging with club and county activities, which is the bedrock on which we are based.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our social activities and our competition element, I am happy to say that our public speaking, impromptu speaking, national soccer finals, GAA finals and our other elements have gone on over the past number of months.  They were held obviously in a physical context and we look forward to more of those in the springtime.  The uncertainty about the new variant and those kinds of concerns have meant that we had to curtail some of our activities in the run-up to Christmas to ensure members are safe over the Christmas period and that Christmas Day, which is an important piece for an awful lot of people, is protected.  Our club of the year competition, which is a major competition within the organisation, and the young farmer of the year competition, which members will be aware of as well, are considerations in terms of our models of hybrid and are physical.<\/p> <p>  From a membership point of view, the past 20 months have been very challenging in terms of the activity levels and the re-engagement piece.  There is a body of work for us to do in terms of re-engaging with our members and showing us what the organisational benefits were.  From a mental health point of view, and I have seen this through my work in Make the Moove, it has taken a significant toll on the social piece, the isolation piece at club and county level and through the wider demographic of the rural populations.  That need from a mental health point of view post pandemic and even right now is huge, and those rural supports tailored for both young people and older farmers and people feeling loneliness due to isolation will become ever more important as we move into next year and beyond.  That is something that will need resources and investment at rural and local level.<\/p> <p>  To finish, on behalf Ms Richardson, Mr. Dillon and Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Denis Duggan who joined us previously on calls this year -  I am seven months into the role as Macra na Feirme president and this is my fourth or fifth occasion coming before the Oireachtas joint committee on agriculture - I wish to acknowledge the engagement from committee members, including the Chairman, and their openness and wiliness to speak to young farmers on our issues and our perspective on stuff.  It is hugely welcomed and is very beneficial to us as an organisation for the challenge the members of the committee put forward for us to think outside the box and to think differently.  It is hugely important from all our perspectives.  That engagement is greatly appreciated and we acknowledge the elevation of the young-farmer issues within the committee is hugely important.  Bringing those issues to light and into the public arena is something which we are really appreciative of as an organisation and I know our members appreciate this as well.  I thank the Vice Chairman and know he will pass those remarks to the Chairman.

Apologies have been received from Deputies O'Reilly and Bruton.<\/p> <p>  Today's two opening statements have been circulated to the members.  The first item on today's agenda is the sectoral employment order, SEO, for the electrical contracting sector.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a mechanism for sectoral wage setting, known as sectoral employment orders.  This wage-setting mechanism is employed across economic sectors and replaced the previous system known as the registered employment agreement, REA.  The intention of the legislative framework governing the SEO is to establish minimum rates of pay, sick leave provisions and pension provisions for a particular sector.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has received the draft SEO for the electrical contracting sector and has laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation.  Both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have referred this to our committee for consideration.  To assist the committee in considering the sectoral employment order, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, to our meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I now invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement regarding the proposed sectoral employment order for the electrical contracting sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having us today.  At the outset, I want to apologise.  As we informed the Chair and the clerk to the committee, due to the D&aacute;il scheduling I have to be in the D&aacute;il Chamber at 10 a.m. for a debate and, therefore, I am afraid that I can only stay until about 9.55 a.m.  I am sorry that I will miss the discussion on the general scheme of the redundancy payments (amendment) Bill 2021 because it is an important Bill.  Our officials will take members through all of that today.  I apologise that I cannot be there.  It was the intention to be there for that discussion with committee members.  I am happy to engage with them after the committee meeting on any individual piece if need be.  The officials will present it and go through it in great detail.  It is a worthy item of legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the sectoral employment order (electrical contracting sector) 2021, I am pleased to present a draft sectoral employment order for the electrical contracting sector.  The draft order before the committee contains proposals from the Labour Court to introduce new minimum sectoral rates of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements, a dispute resolution process etc. for electricians and apprentices in the electrical contracting sector.  This order, if approved, is to be treated as the first SEO for this economic sector.  Before I introduce a specific draft order, I normally say something about the statutory process.  It is important that I talk the members through that briefly.  I am conscious that some members had a recent discussion with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, a number of weeks ago, but it is important that I go through the process so that everyone knows what role we have in this.<\/p> <p>  A sectoral employment order is a statutory minimum wage-setting mechanism in a given economic sector.  Essentially, a SEO is a unique collective bargaining mechanism which, once the statutory thresholds have been met, gives the Labour Court as a neutral decision maker the power to examine an application for a SEO in a given economic sector.  As part of this examination, the Labour Court must explore all the policy considerations set out in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 by affording all interested parties an opportunity to engage with the proposals and have an opportunity to be heard.  Fundamentally, it is the Labour Court that determines whether a recommendation ought to be made and what the terms of said recommendation ought to be.<\/p> <p>  Once the Labour Court has completed this statutory process as set out in the Act of 2015, it has the power to make a recommendation for a SEO to me or the Minister of the day.  This recommendation must be accompanied by a report that sets out the process and matters which the Labour Court considered in reaching its recommendation.  The purpose of this report is to assist the Minister, and the committee, in satisfying me, him or her that the Labour Court has complied with its statutory functions as required by the Act.<\/p> <p>  The role of the Minister - in this case it is me today -  in this process is extremely limited in terms of my decision to recommend that all the procedures are followed to the letter of the law.  Pursuant to the Act of 2015, the Minister has the power to either accept or reject the recommendation as presented.  In this regard, the Minister is compelled to accept the recommendation if he or she agrees, based on the statutory report which the Labour Court has prepared, that the court has complied with the statutory process.  If the Minister is not satisfied that the Labour Court has complied with its duties as set out in the Act, he or she must return the proposal to the court setting out his or her reasons for not accepting the recommendation.  The Minister does not have any power to engage with the substantive recommendation itself.  It is only about the process and that it aligns with the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The Act of 2015 also sets out that the Houses of the Oireachtas may only accept or reject the draft order as it is.<\/p><p>The Act does not permit any alterations or amendments from the committee to the draft order.  If the Houses do accept the recommendation, I will sign a statutory instrument giving effect to this decision.Should the Houses reject or fail to approve the draft order, the proposal for the SEO will fall.<br\/><br\/>Again, the draft order before originated on foot of a request by Connect Trade Union that applied to the Labour Court pursuant to section 14 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.The request was for the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions relating to the remuneration, and any sick pay scheme or pension scheme, for electricians and apprentices in the electrical contracting sector.  This request was supported by a statutory declaration alongside a report by the Nevin Economic Research Institute.  The report set out the union's position of what the scope or definition of the economic sector is, and that it was substantially representative in terms of its membership in the economic sector.<br\/><br\/>Having examined the submissions and the accompanying supporting materials, the Labour Court reports that it was satisfied that Connect Trade Union was substantially representative of the workers of the particular class, type or group in the economic sector.  Connect had argued that it represents 10,349 workers of the class, type or group.  It also submitted that the number of workers normally employed in the sector to which the request relates consists of approximately 16,650 workers.<br\/><br\/>Having satisfied itself that it had the jurisdiction to proceed with the examination, the Labour Court, as it is required to do under the law, published its intention to undertake an examination of the request and invited submissions on 1 June 2021.  Written submissions were received from seven interested parties that represent employees, employers and pension providers.  These submissions are available on the Labour Court's website.  I have also shared the Labour Court's report to me with the members of this committee in order that they will have had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the detail of the examination.  Members will have seen that the 54-page report is very detailed and went into every issue that was discussed openly and clearly.<br\/><br\/>A public hearing was held on 23 and 24 September 2021.  All interested parties were given an opportunity to be heard and to engage with the various policy considerations, including the Labour Court's earlier decision to proceed with the examination itself.  Members will have seen from the report that the issue of whether the application had been made by a body that was &quot;substantively representative&quot; was debated in detail.  The Labour Court also considered the argument on whether the electricians and apprentices working for small contractors could be excluded from the scope of the SEO.  The Labour Court has concluded, interpreting the construction of the 2015 Act itself, that the SEO terms are binding in nature on all<b><\/b>employers in the economic sector concerned, including subcontractors and posted workers.<br\/><br\/>The other matters that the Labour Court was compelled to consider were whether this SEO will support the maintenance of harmonious relations in the economic sector; the potential impact of the making of an order on levels of employment and unemployment in the economic sector; the potential impact on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned; and whether the SEO would be binding on all<b><\/b>workers and employers in the economic sector concerned.<br\/><br\/>I can confirm to the committee that I have considered this draft recommendation in line with the terms of the 2015 Act, relying on the statutory report outlining the Labour Court's deliberative process.  I am satisfied that the Labour Court has complied with its statutory role and that it was appropriate for me to refer to matter to this committee.  I wrote to the Labour Court on 17 November 2021 to confirm that I accepted this recommendation.  Furthermore, as required by the Act, I laid a draft order before the Houses on 19 November 2021.<br\/><br\/>I hope that the committee will accept this draft order.  I believe this SEO plays a significant role in supporting this very important professional sector.  The terms of the SEO refer merely to the minimum rates of pay and terms and conditions.  At times when the sector is buoyant, as it now is, it is to be expected that remuneration for most electricians will exceed these minimum rates.  The importance of an SEO is to ensure that in times of difficulty or downturns, electricians and apprentices in this sector are properly protected.  By providing statutory certainly about minimum rates of pay the economic sector should maintain its attractiveness as a profession.<br\/><br\/>It has been a long-standing practice of the trade unions and the employers in this economic sector to form agreements that govern the terms and conditions of employment.  These arrangements have been in place for many decades and have provided the industry with cost certainty and stability.  Again, it is important to emphasise that this order, if approved by the committee, will apply to all employees within its scope, regardless of whether they or their employers were involved in this SEO process.  In saying that, I am satisfied that any persons who sought to make submissions to the Labour Court were given an opportunity to be heard and their arguments have informed the Labour Court's recommendation on this matter.  There was certainly plenty of public advertisement of the public hearings and the request for submissions.<br\/><br\/>Should this order be approved by the committee, I will sign an order giving it legal effect.  Its terms will be binding across the entire economic sector.  The new order will become effective on 1 February 2022 and will remain in place for two years with additional increases provided for in 2023.  In conclusion, I thank the Chair and members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#A00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and invite members to contribute to this debate.

I commend Connect Trade Union on successfully convincing the Labour Court of the merits of an SEO, which will benefit all workers across the sector.

Why has his Department not done more to tackle the scourge of bogus self-employment?  I ask because the practice seems to be widening.  I also worry that bogus self-employment will undermine the strong and good conditions that have been set out in the SEO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#B00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Before proceeding I would like to introduce my departmental colleagues.

He has raised this issue before and I can assure him that we take it very seriously both in my own Department and the Department of Social Protection, which is under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, where there is also a lot of focus and concentration on this matter.  We take the issue very seriously.  All cases are investigated when they are brought to our attention through a number of agencies that we operate with as well.  The whole idea of having the conversation that we are having today on the SEO process is about good quality terms and conditions but one needs to be properly employed to be able to administer them as well.  We take the issue seriously and there is strong legislation.  At the moment across Europe, we are having a lot of meetings and the issue is a focus of discussion at the meeting of the European Council next week.

I understand it is not the remit of the Department and it relates more to the Department of Justice, but I would appreciate if the officials could provide feedback to the Department of Justice as there seems to be no consistency across the various embassies, in particular in Karachi and New Delhi in terms of turnaround times, what constitutes a legitimate visa application and why applications and subsequent appeals are turned down.  I do not know if the officials have any further knowledge of the issue or if any fact-finding has been done on it but there seems to be no consistency across the various embassies on it, which is a cause of concern.

Quite a lot of apprentices do not stay.  I know orders like this will probably help in some way and that is one of the reasons they are there.  Has research been carried out as to why apprentices leave?  It may be the case that it is not what they expected when they went in initially but it seems to be a real disruption in young people's lives if they take on a role and then leave, as well as a waste of any training time they encountered.

I have had discussions with some employers recently who made the point that many of the benefits we are introducing, relating to sick pay for example, could be undermined by bogus self-employment.  Some of the very large companies are partaking in this.  I agree with the Minister of State and colleagues that we must do more to deal with this issue.

However, in the construction sector it appears to be the case, anecdotally, that sometimes it is due to the lure of the salaries for unskilled workers.  Having been an apprentice for a few years, you can then become a general operative.  The few euro extra in the pay packet can sometimes be the reason people decide to leave programmes like apprenticeships.  These are issues that need to be considered but they are outside my specific remit.<\/p> <p>  The reality of a sectoral employment order and one of the policy intentions is to demonstrate that if you acquire a skill and you become a craftsperson or a skilled electrician that you have a very valuable profession that has a guaranteed minimum income that will never be below whatever it is and the market can dictate it is much higher.  I hope this will go some way, but I suspect there are further issues that need to be examined in that particular space.<\/p> <p>  Bogus self-employment is not something new or that the Department is not aware of.  It is certainly not something that we are not taking seriously.  I recently had an interdepartmental meeting with my colleagues in Revenue and in the Department of Social Protection.  There are three different regulatory regimes, so the issue is decided in different contexts in different ways.  We are looking into this particular issue.  One of the things that occurs to me, which is merely a suggestion, is that there is a need to promote sectoral employment orders to make sure that people are aware of the benefits.<\/p><p>Whether it is bogus self-employment or whatever, sometimes people may think that being a self-employed person is more attractive scenario but they do not realise the totality of it, such as the benefits of a pension and so on and so forth.  There is a lot of educational work that could be done in this particular area.  I hope that going forward, this is an area where unions and employer bodies will work jointly.  There should be some efforts in that area.

One issue that arises for smaller contractors going on to sites is how they are being treated by general contractors.  This pay floor will obviously mandate that a smaller contractor must offer pension entitlements, sick pay and all the rest.  The Department needs to start looking at the line between general contractors and small-term subcontractors and how they are treated.  Ultimately, a subcontractor has to provide this additional floor to all of his or her workers, while still trying to get paid by the general contractors.  A feature of the construction sector in Ireland for many years, which probably is starting again, is that subcontractors oftentimes get hit with charges with lack of payment from general contractors.

I hugely welcome the giving of the legal effect of the sectoral employment order.  It is a real vindication of the processes of the Labour Court.  In particular, I want to pay tribute to the perseverance of Connect Trade Union in ensuring that this SEO was considered by the Labour Court, as well as that the Labour Court has now made its decision.<\/p> <p>  From reading the submissions and the Labour Court report, there is evidently a serious dispute at the heart of it all about who is substantially representative of workers in electrical contracting.  That raises serious questions about the enforcement of the SEO, as well as the responsibility of the State, the Government and the WRC to ensure that this SEO is implemented and enforced.  While I appreciate that there might have been a slight defensiveness on the part of the Minister of State earlier to the effect that laws are in place, it is important that we do not overestimate the effect of anti-discrimination clauses within our legislation.  Ultimately, it is only when we have people working with those who are victimised, when we have trade unions representing those who are put into vulnerable situations, that we will see the effect of those anti-victimisation clauses.<\/p> <p>  Normally, I might be a bit disgruntled to be coming at the end of a conversation.  However, I note what Deputy Shanahan highlighted with regards to subcontracting, as well as the comment earlier by Ms Coogan with regards to the information campaign that needs to take place with regard to bogus self-employment.  There are two issues here, bogus self-employment and subcontracting.  Both have been distinct and indeed related features within the wider construction sector for many years.  There are particular issues associated with both.  The enormous growth of subcontracting has had all sorts of implications for the taking on of apprentices, for the payment by the main contractors to subcontractors and a whole raft of other issues.<\/p> <p>  With regards to bogus self-employment, it is important that the Government, employers and trade unions are brought into the room to discuss how we combat this.  This should not just be about trade unions talking about it, or indeed the Government talking about it but should be about employers as well.  In this particular instance, it should include employers in electrical contracting.  There is a responsibility on the part of employers to say that this is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  I believe that employers have to a certain extent have been let off the hook over a number of years.  The Government could do a lot more.  Trade unions have been talking about the costs associated with bogus self-employment.  A message should go out that employers need to be brought into the room as to how we finally stamp this out.  Bogus self-employment is not good for employers, it is not good for workers and it is not good for the State either, considering taxes lost.<\/p> <p>  I want to say that I very much welcome this SEO, but really, we will need to focus on enforcement now.  In particular, this is because of the issues with trying to bring this SEO to the Labour Court, with getting the Labour Court to make its decision and with the disputes along the way.  Enforcement is vital.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#E01200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Does Ms Coogan have a comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#E01300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Was there a question in Senator Sherlock&rsquo;s contribution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Coogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>It was more a contribution, I had thought, to be honest with you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#E01500","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>It is all right, I do not require any response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#E01600","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>That concludes our consideration of the matter.

The Bill will provide for the making of a State-funded payment to employees facing redundancy of lost opportunity accrual for reckonable service due to lay-offs caused by the Covid-19 restrictions since last year.  As things stand, employees who have been laid off due to the Covid-19 restrictions will not have this period counted towards reckonable service where they have already been made redundant or are made redundant within the next three years.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is collaborating with the Department of Social Protection on this matter.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Orla Mulready.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, is unfortunately not available because of other parliamentary commitments, I am pleased to present the general scheme of the redundancy payments (amendment) Bill 2021 for the committee&rsquo;s consideration.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 pandemic response has had enormous impacts on virtually every aspect of life in the State over the past 20 months.  Its impact on work and employment has been particularly substantial.  Many people lost their jobs, either temporarily or for a longer period, owing to the pandemic.  While we are now experiencing a significant economic resurgence, unfortunately some jobs will not return, and some workers have been made redundant already or will become so in the time ahead.  This general scheme is designed to mitigate a particular issue arising for workers who become redundant after being laid off because of Covid restrictions for some part of the Covid emergency period.  The issue is that under the Redundancy Payments Acts, statutory redundancy is based on duration of service.  A qualified employee is entitled to two weeks of pay per year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a cap of &euro;600 in earnings per week.  However, periods of lay-off in the final three years of service do not count as reckonable service.  This means that in the case of redundancies now arising, where the qualified employee may have been on Covid-related lay-off for protracted periods, his or her redundancy entitlement will not factor in those periods.  For an employee normally earning in excess of &euro;600 a week who has been on lay-off for, say, 12 months cumulatively and is subsequently made redundant, this could mean a reduction of &euro;1,200 in his or her statutory redundancy entitlement.  The provisions set out within this general scheme are designed to plug that gap through a direct payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  The payment will ensure that the employee being made redundant will receive the same overall redundancy payment as though he or she had not been laid off during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  In the normal course of events, employers are liable for the cost of lump sums on redundancy, and this continues to be the case.  However, the cost of this additional payment covering Covid-related lay-off periods will not be imposed on employers because the pandemic-related restrictions were outside of their control.  Furthermore, were the cost imposed on them, that could endanger the viability of some businesses that would otherwise be able to recover.  All qualified employees will benefit from the proposals in the general scheme.  They do not need to have gone onto any particular form of State payment on being laid off.  The criteria are simply that the person qualifies for redundancy in the usual way and was laid off because of Covid restrictions during the emergency period.<\/p> <p>  I would like to explain how we are defining the emergency period.  In normal times, an employee who is on protracted lay-off has the right to trigger a claim for redundancy.  This right is set out in section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act.  The right was suspended as part of the Government&rsquo;s pandemic response.  This was part of a package of measures to help preserve employer-employee relationships and safeguard business viability, as an otherwise viable business could be driven into insolvency if a large proportion of employees claimed redundancy.  The right was suspended from 13 March 2020 until 30 September 2021.  An employee&rsquo;s right to claim redundancy is now fully restored.  The emergency period for the purposes of this general scheme is aligned with the period during which the right to claim for redundancy was suspended.  This corresponds with the period of greatest pandemic-related restrictions and uncertainty.  An employee who has been laid off for protracted periods now has again the right to trigger a redundancy claim, which carries with it a corresponding possibility for an employer to bring back the employee.  With the reopening of large sectors of the economy, the rules regarding redundancy and the mutual rights and responsibilities of employees and employers are normalised.  Because periods of lay-off within the last three years of employment do not count as reckonable service towards the statutory redundancy lump sum, the people who will benefit from these proposals are employees who have been made redundant over the course of the pandemic or who are made redundant within three years of the end of the emergency period, having been laid off for some part of the emergency period.  Therefore, the general scheme refers to 30 September 2024 and this is essentially a built-in sunset clause.  It means that the exposure of the Social Insurance Fund to claims for this additional payment will cease for redundancies occurring from October 2024 onwards.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the overall cost of the proposals, I have to say that this remains quite uncertain for a number of reasons.  While the economic bounce-back has been significant, many people have already been made redundant.  We can also unfortunately expect that some businesses will not survive, leading to further redundancies.  However, one measure of returned employment is the number of people exiting the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and not entering the live register, and those figures are encouraging.  For example, in the first transition of PUP recipients to the live register, PUP claims fell by almost 13,000 but live register claims rose by only 2,600.  In the second phase in mid-November, PUP claims fell by over 14,000 and the live register also fell.  This makes it very difficult to quantify the overall likely cost.  What we can say with certainty is that the maximum sum to which any one employee will be entitled is &euro;1,860.  This is based on an employee normally earning more than &euro;600 per week, who was laid off for the entirety of the emergency period and is subsequently made redundant.  The worst-case scenario, modelled about six weeks ago but possibly already out of date, was that the maximum redundancies at the higher end of the scale would see a total exposure of almost &euro;150 million.  The Department already thinks that is very much on the high side.  However, I stress that this is not the expected outturn, given the significant reopening of economic sectors and return to employment that is already in evidence.<\/p> <p>  I know there have been some concerns raised about the effect of short time on redundancy entitlements.  I am happy to confirm that periods on short time are reckonable service for the purposes of statutory redundancy entitlements.  I thank members for their attention and I am happy to take any queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Breathnach"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I invite members to discuss the proposed Bill with Ms Breathnach and Ms Mulready.

They would have expected to be back in employment after that date as the tourism season kicks off from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day onwards but because businesses were shut down they were not able to go back into employment.

There is nothing in the general scheme which directly addresses those.

I very much welcome this small but important item of legislation that will have a real benefit and impact on those workers who are facing into a redundancy situation in the next number of months and, obviously, a very difficult time.  I am conscious that while the Department has responsibility for the legislation, the Department of Social Protection effectively will be administrating the scheme, if I understand it correctly.  I have a number of questions which the witnesses may or may not be able to answer on that but it is important that we get clarity in the answers to these questions.<\/p><p>How quickly will an application be dealt with?  What safeguards are in place to ensure that once an application is made by an employer or directly by an employee it will be dealt with quickly?  I am not clear on the time it will take to process the administration of a payment.  There would be a concern there might be a delay between the payment by the employer relative to the payment by the State.  <\/p><p> Regarding the circumstance in which an employee directly applies to the scheme, Senator Gavan spoke of a number of employers refusing to engage.  I seek clarity on the other circumstances in which an employee would be able to directly apply to the scheme because there is a degree of understandable confusion and nervousness about the process.  It was suspended and that suspension has just been lifted.  There is a degree of confusion as to what workers are entitled to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#G01700","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  The scheme cannot be launched until the legislation has made its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the earliest constraint but our colleagues in the Department of Social Protection also need to set up the necessary application system.  That involves the development of a significant piece of information technology with a platform that will be familiar to employers.  That is why it is largely intended to be an employer-led application process where employers have had to make people redundant over the course of the pandemic or where they will have to make them redundant in the coming years.  That will be part of that termination process.  It is expected the system will be online and available in the first half of next year.  We hope it will be on the early side of that first half of next year but we cannot give a commitment on that at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The administration of the payment is not intended or expected to be a very long process.  The Department of Social Protection is very experienced in delivering schemes comparable to this one, for example, in situations where it is funding redundancy payments because of an employer&rsquo;s inability to pay.  There may well be some crossover in this case as well, with employers having to let people go and they might end up having the redundancy payments on the Social Insurance Fund, as already happens under law when the employer cannot pay, and having this additional payment as well.  That addresses the Senator's first two questions.  <\/p> <p>  Her final question was on the circumstances in which an employee would have to make the application.  That is very much a case where the employee's former employer simply will not engage and refuses to make the application on the employee's behalf.  We very much hope that would happen in only a very small minority of cases.  Many employers will still want to maintain some form of goodwill with those former staff members.  This will not involve any skin off the employer's nose because the employer is not liable for the payment.  There is no debt raised against the employer when the payment is made to the employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021120100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Breathnach"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Breathnach for that response.

I am thankful for the opportunity to present details of the Supplementary Estimates for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - Vote 29.  The Supplementary Estimate for the Department is a technical Estimate regarding the reallocation of savings within the Department subhead.  A sum of &euro;28 million is being reallocated from the communications programme to the energy programme and will be added to a &euro;132 million forecasted capital underspend on the sustainable energy programmes to facilitate the transfer of &euro;160 million to the energy efficiency national fund.  The transfer to this fund has been approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to provide additional support to households impacted by rising energy prices in 2022.  It includes &euro;60 million for the proposed low interest rate loan scheme for homeowners to improve the affordability of energy efficiency retrofits.  The remaining &euro;100 million will be used to address waiting times under the warmer homes scheme and to increase the number of retrofits supported through other Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, residential and community energy efficiency schemes.<\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;24.5 million is being allocated from the communications programme for the environment and waste management programme to provide additional funding in 2021 for climate financing, litter initiatives and additional carbon credit purchases.  Ireland is committed to concerted global action to address the climate crisis and engages in negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement through its membership of the European Union.  Climate finance plays a critical role in supporting development countries to address climate change.<\/p> <p>  At COP26, the Taoiseach outlined Ireland's commitment to increase its financial contribution to climate financing to &euro;225 million by 2025.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, very much welcomes this commitment and, in support of it, is increasing the climate finance contribution from his Department from &euro;5 million annually to &euro;15 million.  The reallocation requested in the Supplementary Estimate allows for that increase to come into effect from 2021.<\/p> <p>  In addition, funding is being provided for the reimbursement climate action fund for 2021 for expenditure on the Bord na M&oacute;na bog rehabilitation project.  The rehabilitation project is being carried out on 33,000 ha of peatlands.  The works under the scheme are expected to create 350 jobs in total and will contribute to Ireland's target of being carbon neutral by 2050.  Rehabilitation works under the scheme have commenced on 18 bogs and all operatives involved have been reassigned from peat harvesting activities.<\/p> <p>  By year end, the Department is forecasting a substantial capital surplus of &euro;246 million.  This arises mainly due to the impact of Covid-19 on the delivery of two of the Department's largest projects, &euro;132 million in the sustainable energy programmes and &euro;79 million on the national broadband plan.  The extent of Covid-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April this year had a significant impact on activity in the sustainable energy programmes and national broadband plan.<\/p> <p>  Progress on sustainable energy programmes was severely impacted by the level 5 restrictions in place in 2020 and from January to April in 2021.  As a result, the waiting lists and waiting times for the warmer homes scheme have grown.  There are currently just over 7,000 homeowners on the warmer homes scheme work programme.  The SEAI data indicate that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was almost 26 months.<\/p><p>Every effort is being made to maximise activity output since the recommencement of construction activity in the residential and commercial sectors in mid-April.  However, it is inevitable that a substantial budget underspend will accrue by the end of the year.  The Department will be using some of the additional resources from the energy efficiency national fund to increase output under the warmer homes scheme.  This is a targeted measure to protect vulnerable consumers, further shielding them from the impact of future energy price spikes.<\/p><p> On the national broadband plan, National Broadband Ireland commenced connections to the new fibre network in January of this year, but due to the level 5 Covid-19 restrictions in place until April, which closed the construction industry with certain exceptions, it sought an extension of milestones to be delivered in 2021.  A revised target of 59,432 premises passed was agreed with the Department.  This is a 40% reduction on the original target of 102,000 premises passed.<\/p><p> National Broadband Ireland has also faced further complexities working with existing networks, which have also impacted on progress.  This includes challenges arising in rolling out fibre broadband in a rural environment, such as significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles and remediation of ducting.  Building work is now progressing across the 20 deployment areas, with 277,000 premises now surveyed, and enabling work is under way in a further 16 deployment areas.<\/p><p> There is no additional cost to the Exchequer associated with the initiatives being brought before the committee today.  They are being funded from within the 2021 allocation for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on a once-off basis.

The Comptroller and Auditor General said that because the Department does not have control over the investment decisions, including the pace at which those investments are made, he would have concerns about it.  He also had concerns about the significant professional services costs associated with it.

There are three broad categories in the context of retrofit.  There is the local authority grant scheme, which is 100% funding for people in local authority housing.  As I understand it, that is set at &euro;85 million for next year.  There is the better energy, warmer homes scheme.  It is entirely funded from the Exchequer.  It is for people who are on a low income but own their home.  For example, the house may have been purchased from a local authority or something like that and the person may be on a welfare payment.  That has &euro;109 million projected for next year and it will be greatly increased by these transfers.  That will mean many more people who are not renting from a local authority but who are living on a welfare payment and are homeowners will be entitled to have their home upgraded next year.<\/p> <p>  The final category is those who are not living on a welfare payment but are homeowners.  They come under the general retrofit scheme.  The intention was that there would be approximately &euro;100 million for that section.  For that section, a new national retrofit scheme will be announced in January.  Part of that will be a loan scheme so that people who wish to retrofit their home but do not have any capital or savings will be able to get a portion of it paid for through a grant and the remainder paid for through a low-interest loan with some kind of Government security behind it.  The payments on the loan would be paid off through the savings as a result of increased energy efficiency.<\/p> <p>  Those three schemes come to approximately &euro;300 million between them before we make these transfers into the fund for next year, and two thirds of that money is directed towards people on low incomes.  It is very much focused on the people who need it most.  The reason for focusing it towards people on low incomes is that they are the people who are in energy poverty, who have not had upgrades to their houses and who do not have double-glazed windows or whatever.  Those are basically the people whom we need to target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021120100002#C00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I could divide the figure by the average amount for a retrofit but, to give a proper estimate, I will wait until January when we will announce the national retrofit scheme.  I will have accurate numbers at that stage in terms of how many people this affects.  Obviously, it is a large number.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about waiting list times, to which I referred in my opening statement.  The big problem here is that during the pandemic restriction period, construction was stopped altogether.  There was a period of three months when we could not do anything.  Everything got delayed by that number of months.  It will certainly help.  The nature of this is that because the better energy, warmer homes scheme is entirely paid for, there is significant demand for it.  Nearly everybody who qualifies for it wishes to avail of it.  There is enormous demand.  There is also demand among people who do not qualify and are outside the income bands.  Broadly speaking, everybody wants to have their house retrofitted if they can.  There is significant demand.  We are trying to upgrade 500,000 homes in ten years.  It is a decade-long programme and I am sure there will be enormous demand at the start.  In January, I will have numbers on exactly what that will be.<\/p> <p>  As regards the &euro;1.5 million in carbon credits, normally the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, would invoice a year in arrears, but its auditor recommended that it be done this year.  As such, we have been asked to pay out this year the &euro;1.5 million we would have paid out in carbon credits next year.  That is why we moved it in.  It was a technical accounting request that came from the auditors.  I am not sure I can say any more about that.<\/p> <p>  As regards the better energy, warmer homes scheme and the waiting times for the scheme, we are focusing on the people who are waiting longest.  Their homes will be tackled first.

It is imperative that they comply with such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should be also mindful of the domestic law as they give evidence.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I will say a few words on the agency.  The mandate of the agency is to assist member states in the Union in their pursuit of establishing a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union.  Of course, we mainly focus our work on ensuring that cybersecurity, a critical service, and the providers of this service, are of a high level.  Under the network information security, NIS, directive, approximately 70 entities in Ireland were designated as essential service providers.  I am not saying it is too low of a number, but it is clear that across the Union we seem to have a different understanding of what \"critical\" means.  For example, in Finland, 10,000 entities have been designated as operators of essential services.  Cyber threats are cross-border and as long as we seem to have differences in defining what is critical and what is not critical, there always will be an issue regarding how to set a common standard across the Union.  We need a revision of the network information security directive so that we have a more common understanding of what critical means and how to protect critical service providers.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has recently experienced an attack on its heath service providers, and members know the consequences of it; obviously, we should draw our own conclusions as well.  From the cybersecurity point of view, the Irish National Cyber Security Centre does an excellent job, not only in responding to the crisis, but also in making sure that entities are well prepared.  It rolled out procedural guidelines, manuals, trainings and exercises.  It responded in an agile and prompt fashion and it shared information with other member states with the computer security incidence response teams, CSIRT, network so that other member states were knowledgeable about what was going on and could prepare as well.  It was an exemplary response.  <\/p> <p>  One might ask, of course, why the attack was successful.  At the EU level, most entities of essential service providers fail normally because, perhaps somewhat naturally, cybersecurity is not seen as part of their core mandates or core missions.  Guidelines and trainings are not picked up because organisations have not invested in their human resources to make them work.  They lack a dedicated and sufficient number of experts to make things work and they do not invest in cybersecurity.  Some 67% of operators of essential service providers across the EU have told us they need more investments to make the network information security directive work for them.  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we surveyed 36 operators of essential service providers in 2021 and 22 of them said they need more investments.  Overall, EU entities invest 41% less in cybersecurity than their counterparts in the United States.  On average, the budget that goes to cybersecurity is around 10% of the IT investments that these entities make.  Money will not do the trick and service providers need to invest in their staff, and not only into their IT and cybersecurity experts.  <\/p> <p>  Perhaps following the lessons learned, Irish entities are showing the way.  The median number of new hires for cybersecurity functions is highest among all the EU member states.  Also, 50% of the surveyed operators of essential service providers in Ireland have cyber insurance, whereas the EU average is 43%.  <\/p> <p>  For the benefit of the common level of cybersecurity across the EU, I call on this committee to do two things.  First, I call on it to express its support for the quick and swift adoption of the review of the network information security directive that should bring a better common understanding on which critical entities need to be protected across the Union.<\/p><p>Second, I call on it to find ways to support an increase of cybersecurity investments by the entities that operate in critical sectors and ring-fence these investments in cybersecurity.  Member states have different practices.  For example in Germany, by law, all health service providers must invest at least 15% of their total digital investments into cybersecurity.  We hope that in the long term this will make these entities more resilient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lepassaar for that contribution.

That was put in a very straight forward fashion by Mr. Lepassaar in the sense that Finland has it down as 10,000 and this State has it as 70.  It is vital that to get the correct answers we need to ask the correct questions.  Would Mr. Lepassaar foresee that the update of this and the review will take all these factors into account?

I would not  dare to pronounce his name, and I am sorry about that.  On the issue of where the threshold is, where we say that something is critical or not critical, what the Network Information Security, NIS, directive revision does is that it establishes a common minimum threshold across the European Union which captures entities above a certain size.  Given that the negotiations at EU level, among member states and the Parliament, are still ongoing, I do not want to step into this, but the proposal of the directive also foresees an option for member states to include entities which are below this threshold.  That is a good provision because member states have very different economic and social frameworks in place.  Big entities in some member states might be small entities in others.  The country I know best is a very small one.  Critical entities in this country also may have an employee count of only 50, which would not even be considered a start up in some other member states.  There is flexibility but at the same time the NIS directive foresees certain common thresholds.  It is important that we establish this common threshold because if we do not protect critical service providers in a similar fashion across borders, then we establish loopholes.  As is common in cybersecurity, the strength of the chain is determined by the weakest link.  That is why it is important that we have a certain harmony in establishing what these entities are and where the threshold is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>That makes complete sense and there is obviously the need for flexibility because all member states are coming from a different place in regard to this.

That was also the premise of the Commission's proposal to establish a joint cyber unit.  The name is a bit misleading because no structured unit will be established.  Rather it is foreseen as a collaboration platform or a co-ordination framework so that different actors who deal with cybersecurity at the EU level, first and foremost, co-ordinate their activities for the benefit of the member states.  For example, ENISA has a mandate to establish synergies when it comes to operational co-operation in cybersecurity at EU level between different EU actors.  Let us imagine the situation whereby there is a crisis that involves a certain sector which is deemed a critical sector at EU level.  Of course it is the member states which are in charge of the response but they may need assistance.  The EU will then co-ordinate assistance to members states.  It could be the agency I am in, it could be Europol or it could be a specific agency in the sector such as the European Union Agency for Railways for the railway sector or the European Maritime Safety Agency for the maritime sector, or the European Banking Authority for the financial services.  We all have one bit of cybersecurity in our mandates.  To be useful for the member states in these terms, and not only to respond to crises but to prepare for crises and understand the situation and create a common situational awareness, these different bodies of the EU need to collaborate and co-ordinate their activities better so that one plus one plus one does not equal only three, but five.  That is the premise of the joint cyber unit.<\/p><p>Of course the European Defence Agency has a very important role to play when it comes to raising the capacity of member states in terms of defence and cybersecurity capacities.  Again, as I said at the beginning, we also need to respect each other's domain of action and ENISA is, first and foremost, the cybersecurity for the Internal Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I appreciate all that and I will finish by asking a short question.<\/p> <p>  I imagine that Mr. Lepassaar's answer will be that he foresees that the review will deal with the due diligence that will be required in this field.  What sort of structure is needed?  What sort of lead operation do we need that would make sure that we covered all of the bases?  I get the idea of a framework that respects individual states and their wants, needs and requirements.  Obviously one is going to have digital hygiene.  That is absolutely necessary and would stop this before it happens, particularly if we consider the ransomware attack.  Obviously there is a wider issue.  On the defence end, people are in great fear of a cyberattack, which is an almost like a physical attack, and I do not know how one could get collaborative results.  Where defence meets disruption, and I have heard it said and I used the term before, everyone needs a counter strike capacity.  I do not mean that one engages a huge amount of hackers to attack but more to disrupt in the middle of a chain of attacks.

Let me consider preparedness and raising resilience.  What we have at the European level in terms of framework is the network information security directive and the Cybersecurity Act.  There is a lot of collaboration taking place among the member states in the NIS Cooperation Group, which is a group of experts that deals with exchanging best practices when it comes to implementing the NIS directive in different sectors.  The good work they have done is something we should also appreciate.<\/p> <p>  The second level is operational response and co-ordination.  We have two levels.  First, we have the technical level, which is the Computer Security Incident Response Teams, CSIRTs, network, which are national CSIRTs that collaborate in a cross-border manner.  This is a network that was instrumental during the attack against the Irish health sector providers.  It enabled the Irish authorities to share information so that all other member states were knowledgeable about what was happening and shared the technical details about it so that everybody was aware of the attack.  Also, they could rely on the network to extract expertise and member states could, in practice, require assistance from experts.<\/p> <p>  Second, there is the operational level which is relatively new.  It is built on the blueprint, which is a political framework that foresees co-ordination and collaboration between the heads of the EU cybersecurity agencies.  This is the part where the network information security directive really institutionalises this kind of collaboration.  Of course there is a diplomatic toolbox at EU level to co-ordinate a potential joint response by member states, where it is non-EU actors, but when it necessary and required.  At EU level we seem to have all the boxes but now the question is to make them more resilient, more stronger and more effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>So the message is they must be tweaked and ramped up.

What we have seen, which is not a surprise, is that ransomware is a rising and increasing threat to different sectors.  It has become increasingly easy because ransomware is used as a service by some malicious actors.  Of course that means it has become easier for an attacker not only to attack but monetise an attack.  However, we need to defend ourselves from any possible attacking actor, which is always costly and requires more money.  There is a dichotomy or imbalance from the point of view of the defender and that of the attacker.  That is difficult to manage if these organisations that need to defend themselves do not prioritise cybersecurity investments, if they do not have incentives built into their own policies to tackle these issues or if their boards and stakeholders do not want them to invest in cybersecurity.

Unfortunately, I do not have a day to give a full brief.<\/p><p>I will address the questions one by one.  The budget of the agency for this year is &euro;24 million.  It will increase slightly again next year.  There has been a huge increase in the budget over the past three years, which was due to the adoption of the cybersecurity Acts.  If the Senator is asking me whether these funds are sufficient, my response would be sufficient for what purpose? <\/p><p> On the objectives, under the strategic objectives of the ENISA, there are seven clear objectives in terms of what we want to achieve.  The first is that all policy domains in the Union take cybersecurity as one of their core missions.  Cybersecurity should not be regarded as an annex or an afterthought.  When we build new policies, we should try to make them cyber secure by nature and design.<\/p><p> The second big objective is to make sure that the products that are in the EU Internal Market are cyber secure and that there is trust from the end-user in these products.  At the same time, we also try to raise capacities of the member states of the organisation so that they become more cyber resilient.  We try to help member states in times of crisis, but also to prepare for crisis.  We do not look at everything; we concentrate on potential cross-border large-scale cyber events.  The organisation cannot do all of these things alone and so one of our biggest cybersecurity strategic objectives is to ensure that we have communities that work with us.  These communities are well-organised, they know what to do and they feed their own desires into the agency.  These are the five big objectives.  We have an understanding as well that we need to be knowledgeable of the future threats and risks.  We should have foresight of what is coming around the corner, but while doing that we should not forget that the majority of cybersecurity incidents happen because of existing vulnerabilities in legacy systems.  The future is important, but the past is as important.  <\/p><p> On the final question with regard to the obstacles, one of the biggest obstacles I see at EU level is how we deal with the past not only in terms of how we deal with legacy systems in technical terms because they include technical vulnerabilities - the Internet was not built for cybersecurity; it was built for free-flow of information - but how we deal with the past in policy terms and how we deal with the fact that the majority of software providers do not have the same level of responsibility or liability when it comes to the cybersecurity of their products as, for example, do manufacturers of physical objects or products in the Internal Market.  Cybersecurity was not a mature policy domain, but it is becoming gradually more mature.  With this, we need to reassess whether the rights and obligations that were put in place or existed within the policy framework need to be reviewed now and whether it is now time to make the products and services that circulate within our Internal Market more cyber secure by putting more obligations on manufacturers of these services and products so that the end-users do not have to bare the responsibility of always worrying about whether the service or the software they use is cyber secure, but so too do the producers of this software.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lepassaar for his very comprehensive reply.

Does it deal directly with big producers such as Intel, Microsoft and so on?  What type of interaction does the agency have with them?  If the agency finds - I am not trying to implicate any of those companies - that a product or software is not meeting a certain standard, what steps does it take?  Is there a reporting line or are there sanctions?  If a standard is not being met, what is the next step?<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask another question not related to my previous line of questioning.  In terms of the agency's work, what are the top three threats in the EU?  What are the three areas it is monitoring the most?  Has the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the agency's work?  Has it looked at other areas, changed its approach or identified any new or different threats to assess because of the pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#D00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I do not want to create an impression that the companies that produce software do not care about cybersecurity.

Is it tilted more towards the consumer or the provider?  We need to assess whether the balance is right for the current environment.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to threats, it is difficult to say what are the top three.  I will start with the critical sectors because this is where the focus still is.  We have critical sectors that are more mature and critical sectors that are less mature.  There are other sectors which we now think are critical but they are not covered by the network and information security directive.  We found that out because of the pandemic.  There is a second category.  Cyber threats are becoming more hybrid and more linked to other threats.  Whenever a certain sector or domain is under attack, we see an uptake of cyber attacks against this sector.  It happened during the pandemic when it came to health service providers.  Vaccine makers were also targeted.  Research and innovation is not currently covered under the network and information security directive, and neither are higher education and food service providers.  The hybrid nature of the cyber attack means it is becoming more ingrained into the overall threats landscape.  That worries me.  The fact that most products and services that are circulating in the market are not resilient or as high-level in terms of their cybersecurity as they could or should be and that the security by design and default approach is not ingrained into the product design worries me a lot as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lepassaar.  If I may, I would like to pose a couple of questions.  We are looking at the impact of the cyberattack on our health system, which literally not only cost enormous sums of money, but cost lives, and at how we can make ourselves more resilient.  I am taken by Mr. Lepassaar's observation that Germany has a legal obligation on some actors to invest a percentage of its IT budget in cybersecurity.  In Mr. Lepassaar's view, is that a model that should have general application across all states and public agencies and is 10%, which is the figure mentioned by him in regard to Germany, the optimum or what other figure should we be looking at for legislation?<\/p><p> My second question relates to a response to external actors, non-EU actors, in that regard.

The average percentage of investments across the almost 1,000 entities of essential service providers we surveyed this year is 10%.  When I say on average, they also seem to invest 41% less than their US counterparts.  If we put those two together, we arrive more or less at the 15% category.  I would say 15% is a good number from which to start but I am a cybersecurity expert.<\/p> <p>  The key factor behind any kind of collaborative or co-operative response is trust.  We see a rise in trust at the technical level among CSIRT network members, which is very encouraging because, essentially, that enables member states to reach out in times of crisis both to share information and to find more collaborative ways to respond to potential crisis, and during a crisis to reach out to seek assistance if it is needed.  The determining factor in that instance is the will of the member state.  The Union cannot and should not impose any kind of collaboration.  It should come from member states and they can only probably do that if they have a sufficient level of trust among themselves.  We need to find ways to make these collaborative platforms more trustworthy and to ingrain mechanisms to ensure the different actors involved have a certain level of maturity and that maturity is maintained in order that the trust will not diminish.  This is something ENISA is in charge of and it should help these platforms to achieve.  Whether the capacities or capabilities are there depends very much on this level of trust.  I repeat the very good approach of the Irish National Cyber Security Centre.  It has invested in building this trust not only within Ireland but across the EU, for which I am very thankful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juhan Lepassaar"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I have one supplementary question.

I am joined by Mr. Richard Browne, acting director of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, my adviser, Mr. David Clarke, and Mr. Peter Hogan, principal officer in the cybersecurity and Internet policy division of my Department.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in this important issue.  Cybersecurity has correctly been identified as a strategic priority for the European Union to safeguard the benefits of the digital transformation happening throughout Europe.  In addition to the growing interconnectedness of digital services, we must recognise that cyber criminals do not respect national borders.  Thus, it is essential that the member states of the EU work together to strengthen co-operation and information sharing across borders.<\/p> <p>  The EU&rsquo;s cybersecurity strategy for the digital decade sets out an ambitious agenda to meet the growing challenge of cyber threats.  The EU has, correctly, seized the opportunity to be a global leader in promoting and protecting an open, free, stable and secure cyberspace grounded in human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  The strategy includes an ambition for the EU to achieve technological sovereignty in response to emerging supply chain risks.  This will involve strengthening cybersecurity capabilities within the Union through the EU&rsquo;s industrial strategy, as well as funding cybersecurity skills development and research.<\/p> <p>  The strategy includes some novel and interesting proposals to enhance co-operation and information exchange between member states and with relevant EU bodies, including a proposal for a secure connectivity system, utilising quantum computing and satellite communications infrastructure.  The strategy also details the range of cybersecurity legal instruments the EU has published and will follow, such as the review of the network and information security, NIS, directive; the implementation of common cybersecurity standards for EU institutions, bodies and agencies; and the proposal for horizontal legislation on security standards for connected devices. <\/p> <p>  I share the ambition of technological sovereignty and supporting indigenous enterprises and academic institutions to deliver Irish and European solutions to strengthen the security of data and critical services.  However, as the European Council has emphasised, this must be balanced with the Union&rsquo;s key objective of preserving an open economy.  I am also conscious of the rapid increase in the number of cyber attacks and the crippling impact they can have, as we saw earlier this year with the ransomware attack on the HSE.  While it is important to develop the European cybersecurity ecosystem, we cannot lose sight of the need to take positive steps, today and tomorrow, to deploy best-in-class hardware and software to defend networks and systems, whether these come from Europe, the US or elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  I also highlight the importance of global co-operation to combat cyber criminals.  When Ireland suffered its most serious cybersecurity incident last March, we shared information with partners in Europe and received great assistance from the cyber incident response teams in a number of member states.  We also received assistance from agencies in the UK, the US and further afield.  I am convinced of the need to enhance information sharing and co-operation throughout the Union and with like-minded third countries.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the leadership shown by President Biden and his administration in building a global alliance to combat the ransomware gangs who have caused havoc in recent years.  In the Irish context, co-operation and information-sharing with the UK Government is vital and there is excellent engagement between the NCSC and its counterparts, both on a North-South and east-west basis. <\/p> <p>  The NIS 2 proposal will be the key implementing Act for the EU&rsquo;s cybersecurity strategy.  Ireland is playing an active role in the ongoing negotiations in the European Council.  We welcome the Commission&rsquo;s initiative and it is timely to review the NIS directive, in light of the massive shifts in the global cyber threat landscape.  Our focus in the negotiations is to ensure the directive, when finalised, provides a solid basis for practical measures at national and Union level to strengthen the cyber resilience of critical services and important industry sectors; to facilitate information sharing and exchange of best practices; and to strengthen our capacity to respond to major cybersecurity incidents.  This is a considerably important legislative file and it is vital we get this right.<\/p> <p>  I will speak briefly about Ireland&rsquo;s second national cybersecurity strategy, which was published in 2019.  The vision behind the 2019 strategy is to allow Ireland to continue to safely enjoy the benefits of the digital revolution and to play a full part in shaping the future of the Internet.  This involves the protection of the State and its people and critical national infrastructure from threats in the cybersecurity realm; the development of the capacity of the State, research institutions, businesses and people to better understand and manage the nature of the challenges we face in this space; and engagement by the State, nationally and internationally, in a strategic manner, to support a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace.<\/p> <p>  Under the NIS directive, we are required to review the strategy next year.  This was also a recommendation of the NCSC capacity review which we commissioned earlier this year.  I welcome the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the EU cyber strategy and look forward to its report.  I have no doubt that report will be a valuable resource to inform the review of our national strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#F00600","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the committee to deal with this vital issue.  We have had previous interactions on this, in particular at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  We have also had the NCSC review, the full report of which I request for this committee, excepting the redactions.  It would be useful for what we are talking about.  We all welcomed the increase in funding and capacity.  I have previously said some of the experts said they believed there had been a failure to use the expert knowledge base we had in this State, especially in third level institutions, that had made a detailed study of this.  However, we are where we are.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lepassaar spoke about critical sectors or critical service providers, of which we have 70.<\/p><p>However, Finland has approximately 10,000.  I accept that every state is not the same.  I put it to the Minister of State that there is possibly a requirement for a reassessment in regard to that.  He also spoke about investment across the board by American companies in cybersecurity being at 15%.  While there has been an increase across Europe, it has possibly been insufficient.  Perhaps it is something of an obligation that has been put in.  This would probably need to be addressed more at a European level.  I refer to operating systems built with a different business model at a different time.  Software is not necessarily always suited from a cybersecurity point of view.  Is there a possibility that there would be a requirement to put an obligation in that regard?<\/p><p> Regarding his own baseline standards for cybersecurity that have been released recently that go into that, it comes back to the scenario of where we are and what our plan is to ensure that we have all the due diligence done and as best we can.  That is accepting that we have to be able to disrupt and avoid attacks for hygiene reasons and to have whatever defensive or counter-strike capacity that is required, to which I previously referred, but I accept does not fall within the remit of the NCSC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021120100002#F00700","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>We have discussed cybersecurity in a number of different contexts before and also on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked about the capacity review.  We published the executive summary and we will publish the entire report in a redacted form before the year end.  I will share it with this committee as well.  I commit to that for a start.<\/p> <p>  The question about other member states having a much larger number of operators of essential services, OESs, is a reasonable one to ask.  We have chosen as a national strategy to focus on a smaller number of OESs and to do that in more depth.  The NIS 2 directive is coming and I expect to be in Brussels on Friday negotiating this with other Ministers.  Part of the NIS 2 directive is to extend the number of OESs to a much broader sector.  Basically, everybody within the sector that is above a certain size will be included.  A set number of sectors are included and defined as being OES sectors and every company in that sector will be considered an OES if it is above a certain size.  As I understand, that is the proposal at the moment.  That would lead to a much larger number.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned a secure by design approach for software developers.  It is true that we need to design security in from the start.  It is not something that should be retrofitted afterwards, or it is much more expensive to do it that way and less effective.  I agree with that point.  It comes down to there being an education part and a standards part to that as well.  In fact, the Deputy may have noticed that yesterday the National Cyber Security Centre published its baseline security standards for public sector bodies and that provides very clear guidelines and a checklist they should all be doing already.  This is a very clear and accessible guide for anyone who is running a public sector body and wants to know that the IT security manager is doing what he or she should be doing.  Managers can ask if they have identified the key assets to protect, if they are being correctly protected with firewalls or other virus protection, if an intrusion detection system in place, if there is a plan for how to respond and how to recover based on disaster recovery.  It is very clear and straightforward and is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, in America.

I gave the American example, which could be based on the fact that they have been under attack for longer, so it has just been built into their psyche and planning from the point of view of companies.  I ask the Minister of State to deal with that and whether we are now engaging with third level and the expert knowledge base that we have within the State and beyond it.  Is he happy that the joint cyber unit framework will be sufficient for whatever collaborative processes we need to be involved in?<\/p> <p>  Could the Minister of State also provide a little information on the proposal for a secure connectivity system utilising quantum computing and satellite communications infrastructure?  We will probably be the only two people interested in this issue, but I would appreciate hearing about it.  Beyond that, the baseline standards are welcome.

Many of the OESs that are defined already are in the private sector and that is going to be a much larger number than when the NIS 2 directive comes in.  They will be subject to a much stricter enforcement regime than has been in place before, although there is already power to force compliance.  That does apply to the private sector.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on whether we are working with academia.  The answer is that we always have.  It is a very important part of our defence.  When the HSE attack happened, a number of academics volunteered to help us and came in and provided assistance.  They were on site as well.  I thank them for that as it is vital.  A lot of cyberdefence is based around education &ndash; user education, education at primary and secondary levels, but also the advanced third level element as well.

The downside is that it is an input measure, which means there is a target that is all about what is put into the system rather than what is got out of it.  Our opinion is that we want to see measures of performance, that is, what is being done and achieved and what standards are being reached, rather than how much money is being put into the system.  As a result, we do not support that approach.<\/p> <p>  On security by design and what could be done to ensure companies have secure products, work is being done at EU level on a cyber resilience directive.  Members will see in the 5G toolbox produced by the European Commission that there is concern about and interest in whether products are safe to use, whether they have security designed into them and whether they come from trustworthy companies, that is, whether the suppliers can be relied on to supply software that can be used in our critical infrastructure.

Nevertheless, it seems that if Germany is doing this, and if state actors are already spending enormous sums, we should ensure the infrastructure on which we are spending these enormous sums is as secure as it can be from attack.

I will now cover the key summary points of my opening statement shared with the committee earlier.<\/p> <p>  On 22 October 2021, KBCI confirmed that it had entered into a legally binding agreement with Bank of Ireland following the entering into a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the two groups on 16 April 2021.  This transaction remains subject to respective regulatory approvals.  It is our intention to be as comprehensive as possible in answering any questions, while fully respecting the boundaries set by the ongoing approval processes.  While it is our intention to withdraw from the Irish market, I wish to reiterate our strong commitment of support and responsibility towards our customers, colleagues, communities and all stakeholders within Irish society.  We intend that any exit will be carried out in an orderly and responsible manner fully respecting all of the obligations we hold.  <\/p> <p>  We see Ireland as a progressive, open economy that is very successful with an outward-looking society that is attractive to international investment.  At the same time, the model of retail banking is evolving in Ireland and across Europe in response to how consumers want to access financial products and services.  This transformation is also driven by technological changes and new forms of delivering banking and financial services.  This evolution presents challenge and opportunity in equal measure for all retail banks in all markets.  Included in these challenges is the ability to achieve reasonable and sustainable returns on investment.  In this respect, we welcome the recent publication of the terms of reference for the retail banking review and we will contribute positively to that review.<\/p> <p>  While we believe we have been a positive force in the Irish market since 1973, the tracker mortgage issue is a hugely regrettable chapter in what we have done in Ireland.  We have learned significant lessons from our mistakes.  We have apologised in this forum for those wrongs we have caused our customers and I now apologise again here.  At the same time, KBC Bank has gone through substantial cultural change, re-embedding responsible behaviour frameworks in its activities.  Our customers remain central to every action we take and our exit from the Irish market will not be considered complete until we do right by each of them.  Our mission for our customers is to support them in any action we are required to take.  We will ensure customers are provided with plenty of notice of any impact or changes to their account in line with all legal and regulatory protections.  Service remains our top priority.<\/p><p>We maintain strong lines of communication with our colleagues directly or through an employee council.  We agreed on strong terms of voluntary redundancy with the employee council that reflect our deep appreciation of the service given by our employees.  On the transfer of undertakings, TUPE, KBC will, of course, fully comply with its duties to provide choice to entitled employees.  <\/p><p> We have strengthened our employee well-being programme, providing a range of support to staff to help them manage their own resilience and well-being in this time of uncertainty.  We are also supporting staff in preparing them for their future careers with management programmes and career coaching workshops to discuss options available to them when transitioning into the labour market.  <\/p><p> We will continue engage comprehensively with all stakeholders in Ireland.  The board and executive committee of KBC Bank Ireland are fully conscious of their responsibilities to our customers and employees and we are committed to fulfil these responsibilities. <\/p><p> Thank you for hearing our perspective and we are now happy to answer any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ale&scaron; Bla&zcaron;ek","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bla&zcaron;ek very much for his opening statement.

They will require comprehensive answers.  I will try to answer all of them.  As mentioned, we entered into a binding contract with Bank of Ireland on 22 October.  That agreement covers all of the performing assets; &euro;8.8 billion of assets of KBC Ireland.  It also includes the deposits which are in our portfolio.  There are assets, performing assets, and deposits, and the assets are primarily formed by mortgages.  As soon as we signed the contract with Bank of Ireland, we entered into detailed migration talks, through which we are dealing with the technical aspects of the transfer of those assets to Bank of Ireland.  Those discussions are continuing and we probably will have results of those discussions in the near future.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the CCPC, we have entered into the second stage of the review by the CCPC.  Both Bank of Ireland and KBC Ireland are providing full co-operation with any questions or inquiries the CCPC has.<\/p><p>That dialogue is continuing as we speak in a written format.  It is hard to assess when the CCPC will make a decision regarding this procedure because it depends on whether the CCPC requires additional information.  If it does, the certain period may be stopped while that information is required.  We assume, which assumption may not be fully correct, that at the beginning of the second quarter next year we will know the resolution or decision of the CCPC on this review. <\/p><p> As I mentioned at the beginning, this transaction is still subject to that approval.  If the approval is not provided, the transaction will not proceed.  If approval is granted, we assume those assets will be transferred in the second half, more likely in the fourth quarter, of next year.  That depends on when we receive the necessary approvals and on the details of how the assets will be migrated.<\/p><p> The last part of the Deputy's question related to competition in the Irish market.  I will answer it more broadly to explain what is happening not only in Ireland but in banking more broadly.  Banking, including retail banking, is undergoing a massive change.  I think the Deputy called it seismic and that is correct.  There is a huge transition to digital and to a model where banking products are not only provided by banks, but also by fintechs operating across the European Union and more broadly internationally.  Then there are the financial services and banking provided by big techs.  Retail banking 20 years ago was provided largely by retail banks but that is not the case any more.  Retail banking is provided by many participants, including retail banks, but there are niche providers in each segment, such as payments, accounts and loans.  Today the customer has a much broader choice of where to purchase financial banking products than 20 years ago.  Consolidation in the retail market is taking place everywhere, including Europe, the US and many markets in Asia.  It is driven by the technological changes and other big shifts which I mentioned.  <\/p><p> To return to the Irish market, I believe the Irish customer has an abundance of choice in all the products he or she wants to acquire, whether accounts, payment cards or loans.  It is through retail banks and also through new entrants, new banks, big techs and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ale&scaron; Bla&zcaron;ek","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bla&zcaron;ek for a comprehensive response.  My next question is in two parts.  One relates to non-performing loans.  We know KBC has sold non-performing loans related to 5,000 buy-to-let homes to a vulture, namely, CarVal, to be administered by Pepper Finance.  Mr. Bla&zcaron;ek will be mindful that the deputy governor, Ed Sibley, said in November 2019 that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Central Bank does not have a preference for loan sales.  We have a preference for sustainably reducing non-performing loans. ... Banks need to engage with their customers in a sensible and proactive manner with a view to finding long-term solutions that work for both parties. <\/blockquote> <p>I am of the view that is not happening.  As a bank that is leaving the market, does KBC see this suite of repayment arrangements as options or requirements on the bank?  They are not followed by all banks.  Some banks only choose a number of them as options for the customer; others have a different suite of options. <\/p><p>The second part of the question relates to Mr. Bla&zcaron;ek's comments, which were interesting.  I was thinking of the future of banking forum.  We have long called for the establishment of such a forum to look at how banking is evolving, what is needed for the future, how fintechs are playing and all of that.  As a bank that is withdrawing from the Irish market, what advice would KBC have for the State on attracting a new bank?  What issues would need to be overcome?  There has been discussion on the level of capital banks have to hold as a result of the crash and whether they are fit for purpose in the long term.  There are issues relating to how technology is evolving and so on.  What would need to happen for Ireland to be in a better position to attract new entrants, whether KBC in the future or another bank?  <\/p><p>What was KBC's relationship with the Central Bank?

The propaganda claim around that time was that the retail banks were losing as a result of the tracker mortgages.  They were not losing, because they borrowed the money on the international market at a very low rate and had an entitlement to maintain those mortgages throughout the European Union, not to decide to on a country-by-country basis or based on where there was least resistance.  KBC did not have the authority to withdraw that facility from the people, many of whom were penalised, to which my colleague referred at length.  I am trying to figure out from where the inspiration came to apply that new rule.

The key element through the review is for those customers from whom a tracker product was withdrawn or not facilitated and through the examination challenge, we have corrected approximately 3,785 accounts.  As it stands, we still have a large quantity of mortgages on a tracker rate that make up approximately 22% of our portfolio at &euro;2.3 billion.

That was an arbitrary declaration by the bank based on a box-ticking exercise drawn up by all the banks, to which I also strongly object.  There is no arbitration in that whatsoever.  There is no attempt being made to accommodate the various possibilities, except on the basis of the bank's assessment of the situation.<\/p><p> The bank will still retain some interests in this country after its withdrawal.   Mr. Bla&zcaron;ek might mention some of the interests it will retain.  I understand that is the case also with other banks leaving the jurisdiction.  Is this a cherry-picking exercise or is it to maintain a foothold in the market?<\/p><p> Has Ireland become a place where banks do not wish to do business or cannot make sufficient profit on the basis of the size of the market?  I again emphasise that all banks have a right to operate throughout the European Union, but they do not have the right to declare the manner in which they operate in certain sectors of the European Union.  Otherwise, again, the Single Market applies.  It must be absolutely clear from everybody's point of view that if an institution, whether a bank or other, sets up in this country, it is setting up in part of the European Union and the rules apply and they cannot and should not be changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#D01500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

That is something which is important.  It is driven by a number of factors.  It is the competition in the Irish market and some of the aspects of the higher capital requirements for assets which we have to hold in Ireland.  As I mentioned, it is also a function of structural changes that are taking place in other markets and in Ireland as well.  Similar to us withdrawing from Ireland, there are other markets which experience such a similar withdrawal of other participants and they are selling their activities to their competitors.  The consolidation is a trend which is taking place across retail banking.

It is important to understand that the regulatory and legal corporate framework is very standard in Ireland and very similar to all European states.  There are no real differences in this respect.  Also, Ireland is an extremely attractive country in terms of its fluency and gravity of economy.  It is a very successful economy.  New entrants have already entered the market but they have focused more on niche products.  They have not initially started with the global comprehensive retail banking offering but they have either offered current account payments and lending, including mortgages.  That will continue, I believe.  Ireland is a growing economy with an affluent population.  It is very successful in the global economy.  I believe Ireland inevitably will attract those investments.  I cannot point to any specific cases of organisations that will come in the future but I understand there are a few banking groups from the Continent that are considering coming to Ireland to do certain projects because they feel there is an opportunity for them.  That would be the advice. <\/p> <p>  I would probably not advise any entity to do the holistic retail banking, similar to what KBCI has been doing.  The main reason for that is that it requires extremely high and ongoing investment.  That complexity of universal banking requires a large number of customers to support that cost.  Without a large number of customers, inevitably you end up in a situation where costs are not equal to revenues and then the cost of capital goes up.  That would be my advice.  For universal banks, Ireland is in a position which is quite standard.

I agree that the rights of the employees have to be fully protected.  Even though I have not been working with colleagues in KBC Ireland for that long, that for me is one of the biggest positives of my work.  We have extremely good and dedicated colleagues, who have showed incredible and admirable flexibility.  We are focusing on their well-being in many aspects.  The Deputy mention the pensions, which is one aspect.  As I mentioned at the beginning of this meeting, we have programmes with respect to the well-being of colleagues.  We also have training programmes to prepare them well for the future, whatever their career plans may be, in order that they get an appropriate framework in which they can operate.  My belief is that our colleagues are extremely well prepared for entering the job market in Ireland.  Today, there was an announcement of very low unemployment numbers.  Other colleagues have ample opportunity in the job market with their skill sets which they have acquired through KBCI.<\/p><p>We have also put in place quite a good framework on redundancy, which is extremely favourable for other employees.  We have respected all groups of employees appropriately in order that no one is left behind and this is the market standard at present in Ireland.<\/p><p> On the issue of representation, we do our best to have a direct engagement model in Ireland with other employees.  We have had that engagement model for the past 40 years through employee councils and that model has worked and is working quite well in our case.  The employee council properly represents all areas of the bank.  All areas of the bank have elected their representatives in the employee council.  There is direct engagement with the management, with me and with the employee council and we communicate on a regular and robust basis.  Also, the employee council has demonstrated its value in appropriately perfecting employee rights in many aspects of how we progress with the preparation of the transaction and possible wind-down.<\/p><p> I am personally convinced that the model we have had in Ireland for the past 40 years, and which we have now enhanced, works extremely well for employees.

The fact that Ulster Bank and KBC are leaving means there is more concentration happening within the pillar banks.  More concentration leads to an oligopoly, which leads to enormous power within those banks.  They can determine all aspects of the engagements they have with customers because customers have no choice.  There is a banking review happening soon.

Eleven key issues for the public debate are identified, all posed as questions. <\/p> <p>  The first questions reads, \"How can the framework be improved to ensure sustainable public finances in all Member States and to help eliminate existing macroeconomic imbalances and avoid new ones arising?\"  From an economic point of view, this is an interesting question.  There is no definition of sustainable public finances.  I would argue that there cannot be one.  A central bank is the monopoly supplier of money and it executes a government&rsquo;s payments by creating money.  The President of the European Central Bank, ECB, Christine Lagarde, confirmed last year that neither the ECB nor the national central banks, or the Eurosystem, can run out of euro.  Therefore, as long as the Eurosystem is buying up sufficient government bonds within the pandemic emergency purchase programme, PEPP, eurozone governments like those in Ireland, Italy or Greece will not and cannot run out of money.  Since deficit limits are off as well - the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, was deactivated in the spring of 2020 - there is no punishment for overspending, however overspending would be defined.  Therefore, there is no limit to the amount of euro a government in the eurozone can spend today.  This seems to be working rather well.<\/p> <p>  In June 2021, the Commissioner for the Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, stated &ldquo;Strong common fiscal rules should take into account two problems: First, the reality of our different fiscal situation in public finance [meaning the eurozone countries] and second, the need that we have to support growth and sustainable growth&rdquo;.  There is broad consensus that the framework does not work.  Why would it be so bad when the old rules return?  Ireland would return to drafting a budget with a fiscal deficit in mind, instead of addressing the environmental crisis, social deficits and other ills.  The Irish unemployment rate as of October 2021 was 5.2%.  This means that there are plenty of workers available who could be employed to increase, for example, green public investment.  On returning to the old rules, that could not happen.<\/p> <p>  Olivier Blanchard, the former International Money Fund, IMF, chief economist, called for fiscal standards to replace fiscal rules that are one-size-fits-all.  It would be a step forward to revise the economic governance framework in order that the public deficit and debt limits are replaced by employment and European Green Deal mission targets.  If that does not find a majority, then green investment should perhaps be exempted from calculations of public deficit and public debt.  Upcoming changes in the global tax code might reduce Irish GDP and hence increase the public deficit and public debt-to-GDP ratios.  It makes no sense to cut Government spending in Ireland, just because some multinational companies switched their headquarters.  The framework should be more flexible to deal with issues like this.  <\/p> <p>  The economic governance framework should reflect, then, that government spending is essential to generate employment and address society&rsquo;s ills.  The wage growth of public workers is a key determinant of the rate of inflation.  The existing rules have been too tight.  The ECB did not hit its inflation target in the past decade because wage growth and government spending were too low.  Also, the eurozone&rsquo;s unemployment rate never fell below 7%.  That figure is too high.  The rules need to be more expansionary and mission-oriented.  They also need to be tailored to the specific conditions in which the eurozone countries find themselves. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ehnts.  I will begin with my own questions initially.  I wonder about the origin of the fiscal rules and how they came about.  There is the 3% debt-to-GDP rule and the 60% public debt level rule.  I wonder if those figures are supported by any evidence.  If not, why were those particular figures chosen?

The 3% rule for public deficit-to-GDP rule was invented by a low-ranking employee at the French Treasury in 1981.  His name is Guy Abeille.  He had the task of finding a deficit-to-GDP rule.  He saw that the French Government at the time had a deficit-to-GDP ratio of roughly 2.6%.  He thought that 1% would not be enough, 2% would also not be enough yet, but maybe 3% would be a good ratio, because it would give the French Government some fiscal space.  That is how they picked the rule.  There is no scientific evidence that would back up this claim that this figure is some kind of equilibrium rule or socially optimal rule.  There was no scientific discussion in the 1980s about what kind of specific numbers to choose.<\/p> <p>  There is also the public debt-to-GDP ratio, which is 60%.  It is the same in this case.  There was no decision or debate.  The figure was more or less picked because it was a number that was roughly the average of the eurozone&rsquo;s public debt-to-GDP ratios.  That is how they came up with these rules.  The odd thing is that one would normally expect that if a deficit is always to be 3% or less, public debts should rise.  It is not clear how it is possible to fit this 3% deficit rule together with the 60% public debt rule.  If a country runs constant deficits, of course its public debt will rise.  The two numbers are therefore inconsistent.  There has been no evidence that countries with fiscal frameworks like this would somehow grow faster, have less unemployment, or hit any other mission targets better than countries that do not have these kinds of rules.  That came out of, I would say, the ideology of the 1980s and 1990s, that the markets would somehow fix things and that the governments should not play too strong a role in the economy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>That is quite interesting about how that figure of 3% came about.

They also need public investment connected to the green deal.  That means we have to rethink the rules completely.  Many countries now have debt of more than 100% of GDP.  It is not possible to go back to those old rules because we did not hit those targets anyway.  It we have to choose either to hit fiscal deficit targets or have the green investment we want - and the European Green Deal is a European Commission policy - we should opt for the real-world result rather than an abstract target invented by some low-ranking French bureaucrat.

We should imagine the monetary system as one run by a government to provide itself with the resources it needs to do its job.  That is why we have modern monetary systems and why we charge our citizens with tax liabilities, so they offer goods, services and work to the government.  In the end, the euro is a tax credit we use to get rid of our tax liabilities.  If you want to redefine public debt, you could say it is the money a government has spent and has not yet received back in the form of taxes.  The government cannot go bankrupt.  We have clearly seen this in the last two years when the ECB steps in and buys up government bonds.  Technically, the ECB buying government bonds is creating a green light at the national central banks for governments selling those bonds.  As long as the ECB does this, there cannot be a repeat of the Greek situation when that country ran out of money in the early 2010s because the ECB did not get behind it.<\/p> <p>  The monetary system in a democracy, and we are democracies in the European Union, should support democracy.  If a budget is drafted with a majority in a national parliament, then the money that needs to be spent should be made available by a national central bank.  If there is further co-ordination, we can talk about it but it is unacceptable to have an unemployment rate of 7% or more for more or less 20 years in the eurozone.  People want to work and we can easily create or find jobs for these people because they are productive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>My last question follows on from that.

All the other countries have central banks which support the national government. They make sure the national government never runs out of money, even if tax revenues plummet because of a pandemic, for example.  No country with its own currency went bankrupt or ran out of money in the current crisis.  Even as the eurozone, we understood this and I think the ECB has done a great job with the PEPP programme.  It is up to us now to say we can make the money available, so let us target the missions.  Let us have the governments pick some missions they want to fulfil.  Employment targets, for example, would be a great idea.  After years of austerity, policymakers still have the idea that budgets should be drafted with a certain deficit target that must be hit.  They think about public purpose and things to do for the people but it would be better to switch focus and directly address the problems we have today, such as the climate crisis and unemployment.

I will pick up where he left off on what he describes as missions.  That is about what gets measured in the fiscal process.  I gained experience of tracking the EU semester process when I was a civil society advocate and part of the Better Europe Alliance of civil society groups.  What we measure is important.  I had questions around fiscal rules.  Dr. Ehnts has answered those clearly but there was a concern during the previous semester process, which was the annual instrument to measure the application of the fiscal rules and to send country-specific recommendations.  What we found was that not just national missions but agreed collective missions of Europe such as the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth - which was what Europe was meant to have as its mission for the last decade - kind of got put aside for short-term fiscal targets.  We lost a decade when Europe could have invested in the transformations needed on climate change.  We have done some good things in digital governance but we lost a lot of time in investment in the digital area.  We have had inequalities within and between countries.  These are recognised by the European Commission as current financial problems for Europe.  With regard to many of them, their hands were tied in addressing them.  It is about what we measure and the timeframes.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  The first concerns what we measure.  Dr. Ehnts has mentioned employment targets.  The sustainable development goals and indicators from them form a qualitative measurement.  Will he comment on that?  That is important in terms of environmental and social targets and how we measure them qualitatively. <\/p> <p>  Dr. Ehnts mentioned Mr. Blanchard.  While his proposition of fiscal standards as a replacement for fiscal rules contains something positive, they are still economic formulae.  I credit the Acting Chairman for the phrasing because she has said that a rule might be \"Don't drive above 60 km\" and a standard is \"Don't drive at excessive speed\".  A standard is an improvement but it is still a custom macroeconomic formula, whereas many indicators we need might be things like the sustainable development goals and climate goals.  I will let Dr. Ehnts answer that and come back in with a question on timeframes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#O00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":483,"content":"<p>On how to measure those targets, that is a task I would give to people who are experts in their fields.  We have a wide range of targets and should agree on what the targets are.  We can pick some realistic targets, hopefully, and try to aim at them.  It is difficult because we cannot project how much money we need to hit those targets.  It will be interesting to see what eurozone nations will do and what is cost-efficient and resource-efficient in terms of reaching those goals and addressing those problems.  Sometimes it is not about the money but about looking for the right mechanism to reach a target.  We tend to discuss the money but do not address the resources.  If Germany, for example, were to have full employment and we tried to hire workers to hit some kind of target, it would be difficult.  However, if another country still had unemployed workers, it would be easy for that country to hire those people.<\/p><p>We should focus more on the energy we have, the raw materials, the resources and the workers, and not so much on terms such as GDP and euro.  As I said, I would leave that definition of targets to another economist or specialist in the field.<\/p><p> On the fiscal standards, I think the Senator is correct.  Blanchard&rsquo;s proposal is a compromise; with regard to fiscal standards, the rules are not completely thrown out the window.  It is very complicated in the eurozone because some people are afraid of eurozone governments spending too much money, and if the rules are as they are today, there is no limit.  Government spending could just be increased, and it would be possible for any country to buy some kind of firm from another country and move the production to a domestic location.  The euro is an experiment and it is difficult.  It is quite clear that countries should not be able to spend whatever they want but it is also clear the rules have been too tight, given there was an above-average rate of unemployment for the past 20 years.  There was an above-average rate before, during and after the global financial crisis, so there is a problem.<\/p><p> The macroeconomic mindset that applies to policymakers suggests they still believe in and think in austerity, so it is more important to be expansionary and to deal with the problem of governments overspending when it arises.  There is no problem of governments overspending at a national level.  That has not been a problem for the past 20 years and I do not expect it will be a problem for a further ten at least.  Why should we use this kind of fiscal framework to address a problem we do not have?  Of course, one could argue we do not have this problem because we have these fiscal standards, but other countries such as Canada do not have these fiscal standards and they are doing fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>When we talk about what is measured and resources, it strikes me that, while there is infinite inflexibility in regard to how we approach the monetary aspect, there is a hard resource limit in regard to the planetary boundary limit.  There is a shadow cost to carbon, that is, not in the economic sense.  Sometimes I wonder whether we try to fit carbon into the economic model rather than recognising that the economic model needs to operate within a hard and non-negotiable limit in terms of carbon.  The question of which fits inside the other really matters.  Perhaps Dr. Ehnts will comment on the importance of that in the context of our new fiscal rules such that they will understand themselves within that constraint, rather than having it as a kind of an add-on factor that can adapt itself to the fiscal aspects.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Ehnts mentioned that we have not had the issue of overspending for some time.  Will he comment on the idea of the annual framework?  There was almost a move back to having a quarterly report and a market-mood response.  If that same kind of a timeframe is brought in to any new fiscal rules or economic governance framework, how could it curtail us in taking five-year or ten-year investment actions, where the rewards and the necessary changes are going to come in five or ten years?  There is much focus on the suspension of the fiscal rules to allow investment to bridge the crisis, and there may be some arguments, which Dr. Ehnts might comment on, for that needing to be extended for a period.  Nevertheless, there is also a strong argument that after the protection role, there is the transformation role.

The way we are addressing the climate emergency right now is that we are muddling through and experiencing crisis.  Of course, the argument can be made that the Covid-19 pandemic was man-made, in a way.  Scientists have for years been warning in books about this kind of virus emerging at some point in the future, given that land use has increased throughout the planet.

If we want to change the way we interact with nature, recognising we are part of nature and that we cannot overstep the planetary boundaries without threatening our survival on this planet, of course we will need to address it on a longer timeframe.  A quarterly report to update on progress will not be enough and, in fact, it will be counterproductive.  I agree we need plans that are much longer and a time horizon of perhaps ten years, like the Europe 2020 strategy, for example.  That is the way to address those matters.  Forcing countries to hit fiscal targets every year, with the policy targets and emission goals becoming a secondary target, is definitely not helpful.<\/p> <p>  The European Union has to make up its mind.  Do we want the European Green Deal, whereby governments are involved more heavily, or should we stay with the old ideology of public finance sustainability and public debt sustainability first?  No such definition exists.  In a way, you could argue public debt should be zero because in that sense, we could not run out of money.  Perhaps in the next crisis, there will again be falling tax revenues, so maybe government debt should be negative.<\/p> <p>  All these matters are not very scientific.

The Commission indicates public investment should not be made unless there is market failure, which is a very high bar to prove.  Both private and public investment may have a role.  From an economic perspective, however, are there times when public investment to bring about major changes, such as with the European Green Deal and on climate, can be more economically, socially and perhaps environmentally efficient, as well as more sustainable through long-term control in being able to continue to adapt as required to an evolving issue such as climate?<\/p> <p>  Public investment is constrained.  There has been an obsession with things being done off balance sheet and there has been a dynamic whereby the state's role is to create an enabling environment for private investment.  It strikes me, however, that there is a risk in leaving crucial building blocks of society to the private market, such as housing, where there is an inflationary trend that is completely out of kilter with inflation in wages, because we are building in a speculative vulnerability.  Will Dr. Ehnts comment on that?  Is this a period for front-loading public investment, which would in turn support more economic opportunity down the line?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#P00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator's broad points.<\/p><p>The question is do we want to have a larger state or a smaller state.  It is depends on what our targets or aims are.  If we have to create new infrastructure, because we understand we cannot move forward with the infrastructure that we have in place and we must green our infrastructure, for example, it would be a difficult decision for private investors as to whether to invest in that.  They would either have profits or not have profits in 20 or 30 years because we are talking about infrastructure that would be built and would last half a century or even a century.  Often much uncertainty surrounds that.  The private sector normally would not want to invest in those things and it would try to get the public sector into that area to guarantee it profits but that is inefficient.  That is just a waste of resources.  There is a clear case for some parts of public infrastructure to be run by the public sector.  If it is possible to run it with private firms, that would also be okay.  I have a sense that we are now living in a post-ideology world where we would say let the private sector and public sector compete and then we will find out what works.  If, for example, public trains work better than private trains, then so be it.  As almost all of us have public universities, for example, there are some areas where there is strong consensus that it is okay to have the public sector in there but I would also say the public sector has to find a new role.  It has to be leading, not just creating a level playing field.  It needs to be more dynamic and creative.  We need to rethink the role of the state in our societies and the role government.  In recent decades the government was more or less trying to find rules for the market to work within those rules.  However, as the Senator said, with real estate, for example, the results are pretty bad.  Markets are there to maximise profits.  In markets those people who have euro can get what they want but those who do not have euro do not get what they want.  If the Senator recognises, for example, that real restate that is built in this country is built for those people who have a lot of money, then there is a need for the Government to be back in that market.  I would argue it is even clear now to people in Germany that this must be the case.  It is not about building some type of social housing, now there is a need to build for 99% of the population.  We have to rebuild our cities with new infrastructure and that must happen not at a centralised government level but, hopefully, at a decentralised level where citizens can participate and decide what kind of infrastructure they would like to choose.  It would be great if the rules could be changed in a way that we would have more decentralised decisions about public infrastructure.  That would be a step forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Ehnts.  I listened to his comments and I have a few questions.  When the economic crash came we were all dumbstruck and we got a great deal of advice, some of it conflicting, from many quarters as to what should be done.  Even though the advice was conflicting, on the one hand, there was an easy option and on the other hand, there was a different option, but, unfortunately, there was only one option as far this country was concerned.  We had to go the hard route because we did not have the required credibility or credit rating and we were overborrowed.  We had an overhanging cantilever debt and, as result of that, we had to cut our cloth according the measure.  What would Dr. Ehnts have advised at that time and in the event of a similar situation arising again?

It is a very difficult one to answer because you only walk into a river once and when you walk in again it has changed.  When we look back at the economic crisis, the euro crisis, the problem was that the ECB was not providing support.  In a way the political problem was that the ECB was not open to pressure because it was an independent body.  If it was part of the European Union back then. it had very little contact with other bodies of the European Union.  It would have been politically very difficult to get the ECB to create asset purchase programmes.  I would argue right now that if we could go back in time, I would try to persuade people that the ECB can and should back up the national governments and make sure their liquidity and solvency is guaranteed by purchasing as many government bonds as necessary.  Perhaps it is not necessary to purchase them at all because just announcing that kind of programme works.  That type of solidarity mechanism would not cost a single euro.  If we were to have an eurozone crisis, another financial crisis in the eurozone, I think it would be would be handled in a different way.  The last time it was a complete disaster, even from the German perspective.  Ireland was forced to nationalise its banks and that was a bad call, a bad decision.  I know the letter the ECB wrote to the Irish Government and the social hardship it created, but that is the past.  There is no talk about austerity right now.  With the Covid crisis, everything was okay.  They completely changed the rule book.  The deficit targets were cut out.  The Stability and Growth Pact was deactivated.  The ECB created the very big purchase programme.  The European Commission seems to have learned this kind of policy response is very harmful.  That is my perspective.  As a German, I feel very sorry about the role of German politicians back then, but I am halfway optimistic that this will not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Ehnts view inflation as a possible enemy of stability in the future given its various levels across the European Union at present?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#Q00500","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I would argue that right now it is not that we have inflation which is above the target.

The rebound by the energy prices created deflation last year and now it is creating above-average inflation.  If the oil price stops rising right now and the price per barrel of oil is somewhere between $80 and $90 and if it is stable there for the next year, the problem of inflation, if you see it as a problem, will be gone.  Then we will be back to the old problem that we do not have enough inflation, that the ECB cannot hit its inflation target.  We should have a conversation in the eurozone about public wages.  If public wages are rising by less then 2% in most eurozone countries, how is it possible to have prices rising by more than 2% or 2% even?  It seems to be impossible.  We cannot have wages growing at 1% and then expect prices to grow at 2%.  That kind of political system is unsustainable.  Workers would lose and voters would be upset with a system like that.

Of course if one has a monopoly or cartel situation then one should react by creating a monopsony.  One should act as a European Union and say that there is only one buyer with which to negotiate so if one wants to sell gas or oil to the European Union countries then one can only sell it through some kind of European Union institution that we can set up.

Even before the pandemic hit, roughly one third of the countries had debt levels of more than 100% of GDP.  In 2019, ten countries in the European Union broke the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is more than a third of the countries.  Only Romania was punished in 2019 so nine countries were not punished.  It seems like the European Commission politically understands that one cannot enforce the rules.  The rules do not even make sense in good times.  2019 was a good year overall for the eurozone economies but even then a third of the countries broke the rules and these are fair-weather rules.  In the crisis the first thing that we did was get rid of the rules.  Consequently, I think that the political negotiations will be about the deficits that countries will be allowed to run.  In a way, it is a strange game because the deficit is not under one's control.  One can control government spending, more or less, but if there is a financial crisis then tax revenue goes down and that is not one's fault as a government.<\/p> <p>  Choosing deficits is a bit awkward and one thing that could be a step forward would be to say let us negotiate government spending directly, which is the discretionary part.  To some extent we are already seeing a kind of political line-up.  There are the frugal four counties that are a little bit crazy and say they want the old rules back but other countries such as Italy and Spain - Italy and France are now working together - say that countries need to talk.  One should talk about government spending and discuss how much is affordable but then somehow negotiate within the eurozone.  If that cannot be done then countries can negotiate public deficits that must be hit.  These kinds of discussions have already taken place.  In 2014, the governments of Spain and Portugal broke the fiscal rules and were not punished, which was the start of it.  Somehow there must have been negotiations, which I guess took place behind closed doors, where the European Commission say that if the budget deficit is not larger than a certain amount a government would not be punished.  I think that is the political game now.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021120100002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dirk Ehnts"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I guess that the precautionary conditional credit line is a revised version that has been proposed in the European Stability Mechanism legislation in Ireland.

Many of these hard money Germans left the ECB because they were frustrated.  Jens Weidmann was the last one and over the past decade, three or four Germans have left.<\/p> <p>  It seems that the majority opinion inside the ECB is that the ECB will have to take care of the public finances of national governments.

As the European Commission cannot force the ECB to not do that then I think we are kind of safe on that side.<\/p> <p>  In terms of excluding some parts of Government spending from the public debt-to-GDP or deficit-to-GDP ratios, these kinds of discussions are going on.  As an in-between, maybe they are useful.  It is probably possible to do this but I am not sure.  The incoming German Government also seems to be trying to get around the rules and spend lots of money next year because it still can.  Maybe it can just spend some of that money also in the next couple of years but invest it in the meantime somehow.  Everybody is trying to bend the rules and muddle through.

As far as I know, China has no such fiscal rules, which I guess is obvious because it is a Government-run development policy that they execute.  The US has some strange fiscal rules as well but not deficit limits.  I remember that Barack Obama, in 2010, watched over a public deficit-to-GDP ratio of 12%.<\/p><p>That would be outlandish here in the eurozone.  He said, \"No, that's okay, we're going to grow ourselves back to get it back to 3%\", and that is what happened.  The US also has the public debt ceiling.  There has not been a lot of debate on that in the past, say, 20 years as they just raised the debt ceiling every time.  When you hit the debt ceiling, you have to a have a majority in both Houses to raise it, otherwise you cannot spend more.  They had this problem a couple of weeks ago in the US and the decision was taken to postpone the matter until December.  I have not heard back on it.  Normally, Wall Street uses all of its influence to make sure that there is no default on Government bonds, US Treasuries, so that should not be a problem.  They have a pay-go system whereby when there is an increase in Government spending, an explanation is required as to how it is proposed to either raise taxation in the future or to cut Government spending elsewhere in the future or in the present to make sure that it is deficit neutral.  They have different types of fiscal rules but mostly they are harmful because they cause Government spending to be lower than it would otherwise be.  <\/p><p> On the international level, Canada, for example, does not have any of those rules.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, was elected about ten years ago.  He campaigned on the promise of not enforcing austerity, whereas social democrats and conservatives in Canada were doing that.  It gives more choice to have no fiscal framework.  People like to think that the Government can help them solve some of society's problems.  Government spending going up means that the private sector might be producing more but it does not mean that there are more public employees.  It gives you more options.  That is a good thing.  As I said, the other countries more or less ignore these type of fiscal issues that we create.  There are other things that are worse.  For example, in Sweden the Government is supposed to have a fiscal surplus of 1% of GDP each year in normal times.  That is much worse than in the eurozone.  They have their currency such that they cannot run out of their own money so why would they do this?  To some extent, I find it undemocratic to write up in your constitution that there is a limit to Government spending.  Why would you want to do that?  Do you not trust your democracy?

The European Union wants always to make sure that policy is decided at the lowest possible level, which is that concept of subsidiarity.  It is important that economic decisions are influenced by its citizens.  That is why I would argue the European Green Deal could be much more regional and local.  Currently, it is very much centralised in Brussels.  It could be something which improves European democracy.  It is giving a voice to citizens and lets the people decide on what type of solutions we should spend our money.  For example, it would be a nice idea to have the European Commission agree under the European Green Deal to give money to local communities but allowed them to decide what to do with that money and told them only what is expected of them.  For example, it the issue was fixing local transportation, the discussion would be about electric buses, additional bicycles etc.  All of that would be a matter for the communities.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.  This can be about playing on the strengths of Europe.  We all come from different cultural backgrounds, with different histories, so we will find different solutions.  It is not necessary to have only one solution for the whole of Europe, but it would be nice if all of the regions would bring in their own advantages and peculiarities so that the solution is basically fitted to the citizens that are in the end the consumers of those public infrastructure.  Again, it would be nice to give a voice to people in order that they can see that voting and making decisions on various issues makes a difference in their lives.

I suppose people will know that CityWide has warned for the last couple of years that the partnership approach in the drugs strategy has been in danger of collapse.  As people will know, in 1996 the State finally acknowledged that it had not listened to the voices from the community at the time about the growing heroin problem and that led to a radical new approach in drugs policy.  The approach has been re-affirmed by every single Government that we have had since because it works.  It is built on community participation and on partnership inter-agency working.  Crucially, it is built on local decision-making and the guys from Tallaght will be very strong about the importance of that.  We know from experience that these things are crucial in order to have an effective response to drugs.<br\/><br\/>The current national drugs strategy Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery was launched in 2017.  The strategy clearly recommits to this approach as follows: &quot;It recognises the importance of supporting the participation of communities in key decision making structures&quot;, which is a crucial phrase, &quot;so that their experience and knowledge informs the development of solutions to solve problems&quot;.  We are really sorry to say that the words in the strategy have not been delivered on because the decision-making authority at national, regional and local levels has been taken away from the partnership structures whether that is the national committee, on which CityWide participates, or the task forces that Mr. Hamilton and Ms Hill will talk about.  The decision-making power has reverted back to the Department of Health and the HSE.  They make key decisions centrally and without consultation with communities.<br\/><br\/>The national oversight committee is the main national committee.  Its terms of references makes it sound like a really powerful committee as it gives leadership, direction, prioritisation and allocates resources.  We can say, having been representatives on that for the last three years, that we have not been involved in one significant decision in all that time. <br\/><br\/>As members will know, the drug and alcohol task forces have done amazing work over the years in responding to the needs that emerge in communities.  However, their ability to carry out that role has been undermined by the recentralisation of the decision-making process.  I am sure that people will be very familiar with the fact that there has been a failure to properly recognise and fund the community drugs projects, which are the absolute backbone of service delivery in this country.  The members will hear more about this matter from the guys from Tallaght.<br\/><br\/>Why is this a significant time?  Last week, the report of the mid-term review of the current drugs strategy was published and it has confirmed all of our worst fears.  The report has a fundamental flaw in that it has failed to recognise the central role played by communities in the national drugs strategy, which puts it at odds with all of the overwhelming evidence.  That evidence shows the crucial role played by communities and brings extensive knowledge to bear on all of the emerging issues, and communities have led the way on so many issues.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, the review has chosen to ignore experience.  How can we learn from and build on the knowledge and experience of communities when we do not even name it?  How can we develop effective services when we fail to recognise the unique role played by community drugs projects?  They work across a whole range of actions and not just the addiction issues but a spectrum of issues, including housing, education, mental health, domestic violence and intimidation.  The review did not recognise the centrality of that role.<br\/><br\/>With the mid-term review the Department has written the community sector out of the national drugs strategy.  That has happened at a time when we know, across the country, that the number of areas experiencing a community drug problem has significantly increased.  Now more than ever we need a community and State partnership.<br\/><br\/>Let me explain why the review is so significant.  Next Friday, the national oversight committee will meet.  At that meeting the Department intends to remove the community and voluntary networks that have played a representative role in the national drugs strategy.  I wish to note that CityWide has done so for 25 years and many of the other networks have been around for many years.<br\/><br\/>The Department intends to remove us from our national representative role without a review, explanation or discussion.  If this is allowed to go ahead next Friday then it will bring down the curtain on the inter-agency partnership approach that has been at the heart of the drugs strategy since 1996.  That means we will be turning our back on communities like Tallaght and all of the communities around the country that so badly need to be heard.  I call on the Government and all parliamentarians to make sure that this does not happen.<br\/><br\/>I thank the members for their time and look forward to questions.  In particular, I look forward to hearing from Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Hill about the great work that their organisations do in Tallaght.<br\/><br\/><b>Ms Grace Hill:<\/b>It is great to see so many people here and I thank Ms Quigley for setting us up really well.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for the invitation to attend following our launch of our research on the topic of the landscape of substance misuse and its impact on the communities we serve, which is Tallaght and Whitechurch.  In summary, the report provides an insight into the current picture of drug use in Tallaght and Whitechurch.  We want to address the impact of crack cocaine in our areas and discuss what community projects are doing with limited resources to support these issues.  We want to discuss why we now have a crisis in our communities and why we urgently need a Government response in terms of funding.<br\/><br\/>I am joined by Mr. Shane Hamilton who is the manager of Jobstown Assisting Drug Dependency, JADD.  He is here to talk about the organisation's work to tackle crack cocaine use.  <br\/><br\/>The report has confirmed that over the past ten years Tallaght has seen a significant growth in population, deprivation, substance misuse and drug-related crime.  The area has a population of 100,000 and it is still expanding.  The size of the area exceeds cities like Limerick and Galway.<\/p><p>Tallaght is also surrounded by areas such Citywest, Saggart, Rathcoole and Knocklyon and referrals often come from those areas too.  The number of people accessing drug treatment in our area has doubled in the past ten years, with most people using two or more substances.  While heroin was the most used drug in 2020 in our area, cocaine came in second with crack cocaine use proving the most problematic for individuals and families.<\/p><p> After consulting with our front-line services and community representatives, the task force named crack cocaine as its number one issue in 2021 and that is supported by feedback from the public consultation, with terminology such as &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; and &ldquo;tsunami&rdquo; used to describe what was happening on the ground.  What this looks like is open drug dealing happening all day long, drug-related intimidation and crime, and drug users presenting with complex needs.  Mr. Hamilton will touch on more of that.<\/p><p> Already in 2021, more than 4,000 crack pipes have been distributed by our community harm reduction services.  This figure exceeds the total number of pipes issued this year in the whole mid-west region, which includes Limerick city and beyond, according to Ana Liffey Drug Project.  Interim funding for our task force is approximately &euro;1.2 million, below the level of funding we were getting in 2010.  Despite Government funding increasing by approximately 50% in the past decade and a health budget of &euro;21 billion, we have not seen any increase at the front line.  This is also the case for the other 13 drug and alcohol task forces in Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p> The Tallaght Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, while discussing our research findings, of which the committee may have seen the considerable media coverage, has been very open with its views concerning the proposed budget for the national drugs strategy next year and notes it lacks the urgency required to support front-line community drug services that are struggling now.<\/p><p> With respect to the crack cocaine issue, the budget of &euro;500,000 for the entire country lacks any understanding of the scale of the problem on the ground and level of supports required to address it.  We know that crack cocaine is an issue for other task force areas, but not every community is seeing the same concentration that we are, teamed with the level of poverty in Tallaght and the co-morbidity rates.  We know that targeting of any available funds, albeit limited, is very important.<\/p><p> When we launched the research earlier this month, we made the case for an additional allocation of &euro;1 million for a task force.  Most pressing on our needs list was to address the crack cocaine issue and support struggling front-line community services.  As a task force, our role is to empower community drug services to meet the needs of their communities and the same rationale applies to the crack cocaine issue.<\/p><p> In 2018, we set up two crack cocaine-specific programmes, in Jobstown and Killinarden.  These programmes are effectively working with crack users around their many complex issues, albeit on a part-time and quite limited basis.  Come 1 January, we will have no funds to sustain this crucial work on the current crisis and we urgently need support.  We also know crack cocaine is only a symptom of years of neglect in terms of empowering drugs services and the community sector more broadly, as Ms Quigley spoke about.<\/p><p> With four weeks to the end of this year, it is vital that the allocation of funding announced, although limited, is targeted and allocated as a matter of urgency.  We call on the Government to allocate this funding to Tallaght and other areas impacted by crack cocaine, as soon as possible.  We welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, has indicated that he will come to Tallaght before the end of the year and we look forward to discussing our report and the need for urgent funding with him.<\/p><p> Before handing over to Mr. Hamilton, I will give the committee a more practical view of the work being done here.  Recovery is possible and recovery communities are active in our communities, which is great to see.  I want to promote that positive news.  In tandem with launching our report, we launched a series of videos on what recovery looks like, which are available on our website and YouTube channel.  They have considerably helped people connect with the drug issue, teamed with the grim findings within our research and we welcome that move.<\/p><p> Last Thursday night, I accompanied community drug workers from the crack cocaine outreach service run by JADD out into the community on their assertive outreach run which supports the most vulnerable drug users across the Jobstown and west Tallaght area.  From the experience, I can say many things with complete certainty, one of which is the supports being provided by community drug services in response to crack cocaine, through the community addiction response programme, CARP, the JADD Project and community drug work are extremely essential, front line and lifesaving.  That might sound sensational, but they are.  No other organisations are providing such rounded services in terms of nourishment from food, contact point, harm reduction in terms of clean works, sign posting and referrals.  Community drug services are well placed and, in our view, best placed to do this work within the community where they are based, if funded to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Quigley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quigley and Ms Hill for opening up this discussion on this important issue, specifically for front-line services impacted by crack cocaine.  As Ms Hill alluded to, until 2018, heroin was the primary drug of choice among individuals accessing services in JADD and services were developed primarily to respond to the problems associated with heroin use.  However, since 2018, crack cocaine has emerged and become the primary problematic drug in Jobstown and the surrounding areas, including Killinarden and throughout west Tallaght.<br\/><br\/>Crack cocaine is no longer an emerging drug.  Its availability and use are widespread throughout Tallaght and highly problematic.  Crack cocaine use is a permanent feature in most addiction services in Tallaght and will be for the foreseeable future.  Crack cocaine is a completely different drug to heroin.  There is no substitute pharmacological treatment or silver bullet to address this issue.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the prevalence of crack cocaine use in JADD&rsquo;s methadone service, we have just over 60 patients who attend daily, 70% of whom report crack cocaine use.  This high prevalence of crack cocaine use among opioid users is in line with European data, with those European figures stating that 40% of those seeking treatment for crack cocaine use report heroin as their secondary drug of choice.<br\/><br\/>The majority of these patients in JADD would have previously had long periods of stability on methadone treatment.  They would have completed education courses, returned to the workforce and managed successful and healthy family homes.  However, the majority are now back attending the clinic on a daily basis, such is the extent of their respective crack cocaine use.  Crack cocaine use is destabilising the recovery of a significant number of individuals on methadone treatment.<br\/><br\/>As outlined in the research, there is a considerable proportion of women using crack cocaine.  This is in line with international data which states one third of all people seeking treatment for crack cocaine related problems are women.  One study, in line with the figures locally, found that 90% of women reporting, reported involvement in the sex trade as a means to fund their addiction to crack cocaine.  JADD is concerned about this and its impact on women and children, in particular.<br\/><br\/>Since 2018, JADD has supported 20 women whose children have been removed from their care because of their crack cocaine use and whose use is a barrier to those children returning to the family home.  Among these 20 women, there are 45 children in care, with a sizeable number having previously attended JADD&rsquo;s childcare service.  It is unlikely that these children will return to these homes any time soon, because of this crack cocaine use, as research has found that women involved in sex work who are single mothers have been found to develop the most chaotic crack cocaine dependency.  Therefore, it is critically important that any response to this issue must include a broader, early intervention response to families affected by crack cocaine use.<br\/><br\/>We welcomed Kitty Holland from <i>The Irish Times <\/i>to come out with us in early November to meet some of these individuals and she was invited into the homes of some of these women impacted by crack cocaine.  One of the examples Ms Holland was able to confirm and write about was:<\/p> <blockquote> \tRobyn (45) has been on drugs most of her life. &ldquo;But crack cocaine has destroyed me in less than five years.  I have lost my four beautiful children to [this drug].&rdquo; <\/blockquote> <p>Ms Holland also reported that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTheresa (43), almost lost the apartment she rents from an approved housing body due to her addiction.  It is dark and cold.  Her daughter&rsquo;s toys are everywhere, though she has not seen her for two years ... Aisling is trying to use less as she is hoping to get access visits with her children, who now live with her sister.  She had a &ldquo;total psychotic breakdown&rdquo; about four months ago.  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t come down.  I got paranoid by a hundred, climbing out the windows, thought everyone was against me.  It was very frightening.&rdquo;  [Aisling] spent 19 nights in a psychiatric ward, but discharged herself.  Thwarting her efforts to reduce are dealers &ldquo;bombarding&rdquo; her with text messages, offering &ldquo;two-for-one&rdquo; deals; saying &ldquo;We drive to you, 24\/7&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote> <p>The role of a front-line crack cocaine service has evolved to provide extensive and intensive support services towards the most damaging and complex areas in a service user's life.<\/p><p>Over the last few months for example, JADD has had to dedicate significant resources into a partnership with a task force with South Dublin County Council specifically for tenancy sustainment for crack cocaine users.  Drug use is a restrictive factor in many areas of an individual's life but it is exacerbated completely by crack cocaine use regarding accessing appropriate residential treatments or domestic violence accommodation, or engaging successfully with multiple agencies.  This has to be the role of any future agency.  <\/p><p> In response to the extent of crack cocaine use, and wanting to understand the issue further, JADD self-funded an assertive outreach service from September 2021, as Ms Hill mentioned.  This was to target the most vulnerable and isolated crack cocaine users including rough sleepers, those couch surfing, and those whose using in houses was permitted.  This service has allowed JADD to scope the prevalence further and unfortunately we have identified many more service users within the immediate area, many in very unsafe environments, which is concerning from a public health perspective.  These assertive outreach services are identifying many more individuals and situations with multiple users present, sharing drug using paraphernalia. <\/p><p> There is also an unintended consequence of stigmatising these houses as crack houses, which has been an issue for Tallaght to try and resolve.  I would like to note to the committee that many of these homeowners are vulnerable women, whose homes are often controlled by others through violence, intimidation and so forth.  Resolving these issues requires a compassionate and considered approach.  Not all of these instances are of an antisocial nature.  <\/p><p> These individuals, families and communities I have spoken about need members on their side.  They need the support of this committee.  As we all know, drugs are available in most communities, but they do not impact all communities in the same way.  Crack cocaine is destroying the sense of community in parts of Tallaght, specifically in west Tallaght.  I urge members to support our call for funding to keep individuals safe, to keep families in their homes, to keep children with their families, to minimise the public health risks and to increase treatment supports to individuals and families affected by crack cocaine use.  The community response to this can be successful.  It just has not been given the opportunity to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Hamilton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Ms Quigley must leave at 11 a.m.  We will divide the meeting into two sections.

It was a case of the State not responding to the drug issue.  There was an emerging heroine issue at the time.  That problem was developing in some of the most disadvantaged parts of the country.  It was not getting the kind of political response it needed.  Communities got organised to campaign and call attention to the issue.  They were not listened to for a long time.  That was acknowledged by the Government in 1996, that it had not listened.  This is something everyone knows.  People who are active and engaged in our communities on the ground are aware, they see what is going on in their areas.  They are the people, the community leaders, who saw the drugs issue emerging in their areas, in north Dublin inner city in the early days when heroine started to emerge.  People had no idea what was going on.  It was new.  Like the story Mr. Hamilton related about crack cocaine, at one stage heroine was new and nobody in these communities knew what was going on.  They knew something was going on, that this drug was available.  They knew young people were using it and getting sick and it was having a huge impact on them.  Because they are engaged on the ground, they have that knowledge.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say that is expertise.  This is something we always say, as community representatives, because there is a tendency to believe that the experts are the people who know about particular types of treatment or the signs, and of course those are needed, they are crucial, but the expertise is there and we need to base our policies on reality.  That is the key point here.  What community brings to the table is reality.  What Mr. Hamilton described here is reality, the reality in Tallaght.  The reality will be different in communities throughout the country.  <\/p> <p>  Recently we did a survey on the development of the drug problem in rural areas and we saw the same thing.  It was community leaders, people who were engaged in their community were the people coming forward with the information.  Another reason that is crucial is, from the beginning in our work we have seen communities, people who use drugs, and families together, unified.  Sometimes in communities there is a huge stigma attached to drug use, particularly the most difficult experience such as crack cocaine.  It is crucial we have people in our communities speaking out for a positive response in support of people who are using drugs and their families because it is easy for the problem here to be perceived as being the people who are using the drugs.  It is easy for them to be seen as the root of the problem.  That is why leadership and voices from within the community strongly saying \"No\", the people who are using the drugs and their families are all part of the one community and we want to work together. <\/p> <p>  One of the things Ms Hill spoke of - and it is a crucial part of what the community drug projects do - is the successes.  I have been to many events in local communities.  The local projects organise public events that are open to all of the community.  Everybody comes in, from the schools, the clubs, the churches, together with the people who have been involved in those projects.  That role is essential in our communities because there is too much potential for division, particularly now that there is so much intimidation and fear out there.  It can be extremely difficult for people who use drugs and for their families.  They are caught up in all that.  For them to be able to come and speak out is incredibly difficult so we need our community representatives.  We have always supported the view that people who use drugs and their families should have their own strong voice.  We absolutely need that community representation. <\/p> <p>  On the point of funding, when that community expertise is not recognised and respected, and at the moment there is no sign that it is respected, then that shows in how funding decisions are made.  We do not understand why, people will know that from 2008 to 2013, the years of the crux, the budgets to the task forces and to their projects were cut by a total of 34% which is far above the national average level of cuts to services.  Since those cuts stopped in 2013, that is eight years ago, there has been no restoration of those budgets.  The task forces are operating on budgets that were significantly reduced during the recession, and in all the years since, with all the new problems and challenges that have emerged, as Mr. Hamilton described, there has been no increase in the budgets.  Additional money has been allocated to the national drugs strategy for the past five or six years, and it will be sought again this year, some &euro;6 million, none of which comes to the projects on the ground.  We do not understand why that is, especially as the projects are such good value for money.  <\/p> <p>  Originally in the drugs strategy whatever actions each Government agency and Department were responsible for were funded from within their budgets, and the specific drug initiative budget for the task forces was separate and it went directly to the task forces.  Now it goes to the HSE and the HSE decides what should be done with it.  It needs to come back as a ring-fenced budget for the use of the task forces to fund the local drug projects, and not be absorbed into the HSE budget.  That is crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Quigley"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quigley.

There are two pieces there.  The first concerns addressing and raising emerging needs.  The current structures we have to do that are nothing short of a cat and mouse game.  For instance, 12 months ago we met with the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.  He advised us to go to the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy and not to forget to go to the national office of the HSE.  That meeting never happened with the national office.  That sends us back down to HSE addiction services locally, which we work very well with, but they, like community drugs services, are not empowered to address our needs.  There is, as Ms Quigley has said, a block in the system.  We have a good relationship with the addiction services.  We go to them and say: \"Listen, crack cocaine, what can we do?\"  They ask us why we do not set up a project.  That should not be the system.  There is a clog in the system.  The addiction services and HSE locally want to help us but the budgets are not coming to them either.<\/p> <p>  Regarding 1 January for us in Tallaght, we are concerned because we do not have any funding to address the crack issue.  It is as simple as that.  We have been plugging this with the very little money we have in a development fund because the task force is underfunded as well.  We have been funding those two crack cocaine responses with &euro;25,000 each.  That equates to about three hours per week in terms of additional work on already struggling front-line services.  It is serious for us.  We have seen the value of what the services are doing on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  As I said in my presentation, the figure of &euro;500,000 demonstrates no understanding of how colossal this issue is.  How long is a piece of string?  We need to have that discussion.  What does a real response to this issue look like?  In terms of the country in Tallaght alone, &euro;500,000 will not cut it.  When we launched our report, we called for an additional &euro;1 million fund.  We felt we needed that to get us started and to be able to respond to this issue.  I cannot even say that would be enough for the crack issue in Tallaght.  That issue is only a symptom of the years of lack of restoration, as Ms Quigley talked about.<\/p> <p>  We need to make sure all front-line services are sustainable and equipped to address the challenges, given the years of cumulative budget reductions.  As Mr. Hamilton said, an interagency approach is key.  We need to make sure everybody is strong and able to respond to it on the ground.<\/p> <p>  We are worried about January because I have seen the service users that avail of these services.  They are extremely vulnerable.  We are in the winter months.  As Mr. Hamilton said, some people are sleeping rough and we have women who have to resort to prostitution to pay off drug debts.  I am concerned, as is our task force, that the supports are not there.  By the nature of community drug services, they want to respond to these issues on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Grace Hill"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Mr. Hamilton has his hand up.

There is treatment versus prevention.  The drugs budget has gone up by &euro;6 million but in terms of prevention there are issues like housing, education, apprenticeships, sport recreation the need for garda&iacute;, particularly community garda&iacute;, and employment issues.  In treating addiction and hoping for full recovery, those issues are important.  Are these resources lacking?  We know about the housing issue and, unfortunately, could talk about that all day.

We asked as part of the mid-term review that there be a review of the structures to look at how effective they were.  There was no such review so there is nothing there.  There is no report or anything to give evidence that this is a good thing to do.<\/p> <p>  It was at the last national oversight committee meeting that the Department presented the idea of a civil society grouping, which would be a wider grouping than the current networks.  The networks are totally open to that.  We said the more voices we have involved the better.  We told the Department we were happy to have discussions around that with it, which we always are.  In the discussions it quickly became clear that the Department was thinking of the civil society grouping as a replacement for our networks, while we saw it as a good additional resource to bring in more people. <\/p> <p>  Our networks are named in the national drugs strategy.  That is not by accident.  There is a clear rationale as to why we need representation of particular communities and groups like families and people who use drugs.  The rationale is clear that we need representation of the people most affected by the issues.  That rationale is still there now as it was.  We have not been presented with any argument against that.  Having had a couple of meetings to discuss this with the Department, the networks went back and said we were happy to have ongoing discussions about the broader civil society grouping but that we were clear on the rationale as to why our networks with 25 years' experience should continue to be written in as core constituents of the national drugs strategy.  The response to that was basically \"Well, it's going ahead on Friday anyway\".  We do not have a rationale, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  I say this with respect to everybody but in the last couple of years there has been for the first time in our 25 years' involvement a sense of silencing of the community sector and that the space for voices that are questioning or dissenting is not there anymore.  I am not saying that is the reasoning but we have not been given any other reasoning.  I do not know the reason.  We have no statement of the reason.

One positive thing that came out of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy was the call for an area-based approach.

I am an employee of South Dublin County Partnership and a lot of that work is already happening.  We liaise regularly and have great relationships with garda&iacute;.  A key recommendation in the research is for more community garda&iacute; on the street.  However, that inter-agency piece is happening.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator said, there is definitely a need for balance between treatment and prevention.  Certainly, one of our recommendations is strengthening the front line.  It is about finding a different way to work with young people, for instance.  We want to have a pilot around detached street work.  We have to constantly be looking at new ways to do that.  There is definitely a balance to be struck there.  The re-emphasis on an area-based approach is a positive thing that came out of the mid-term review.  It is great in theory.  However, there is an awful lot of work to be done in practice around that because, as I said in my previous point, the current structures do not afford that.  <\/p> <p>  As I said, the Minister of State will tell us to do things in a regional way and one goes to the national office of the HSE.  However, that does not happen.  It does not respond; it just refers people to their community health organisation, CHO, 7 addiction services.  As I said, that section is not empowered to meet our needs as well.  We work with them closely on the ground, but in terms of resources - and I am sorry to be constantly bringing it back there - there is a lot of work to be done.  The area-based approach can definitely be improved on.  There is always room for improvement.

From a front-line manager's perspective, sitting in the community and looking at this on a daily basis, a colleague of mine has called this a college industry.  This is now coming across in every element of this local area, from young people through poverty and desperation getting involved in the distribution of it to people being vulnerable and intimidated into production.  It is presenting in every element of a very vulnerable community.  When we look at prevention and treatment, we also need to look at what kind of symptomatic issues are part of this and make sure that we invest in the communities that can respond to this effectively.

There needs to be political response saying that this is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable to take the existing networks away from the representative role in the drugs strategy.  That has been a core part of the approach and we would ask both the Minister of State and the senior Minister for a strong political response on that.

I would like to welcome the guests and thank them for their presentations.  I wanted to check something first.  I had the honour of being able to chair some of those national oversight committees back in 2011 and 2012.  Certainly, my experience at that time was that one got a real insight into the drugs scene at local level from the community and voluntary sector representatives.  That was undoubtedly the case in the community.  This came back from organisations like CityWide, but also from the local drugs task forces.  That is how one found out what was happening on the ground.<\/p> <p>  In the voluntary sector, different representatives represented those voluntary community services, like Merchants Quay and so many others.  One heard on the ground what it is like dealing directly with people with addiction problems.  There was essential feedback from the real world about what was happening on the ground.  Down through the years, I have never heard any complaints about that whatsoever.  It was important that both of those voices were heard clearly and that they informed policy.  However, down through the years, there were constant complaints about representatives from other agencies - in the main these were State agencies - about their non-attendance at task force meetings, their non-attendance at the national level, or the attendance by people who did not speak at all and did not contribute to any of the debate or any of the insight.  That was a constant refrain, particularly in the education area.  Representatives refused to attend local task forces.<\/p> <p>  I can remember sitting through many of those meetings.  Thinking back, if there had not been input from the community and voluntary sector, meetings would have wrapped up after probably half an hour.  This is because no contributions were being made by anybody else.  It was really placeholders in the main, as well as people who were there because they were required to be there, rather than having any particular interest.  That is very much the way that things had worked.<\/p> <p>  I cannot for the life of me understand how there can be any rationale for writing out those critical voices.  They are critical because they are essential.  They are also critical because they criticise Government policy where it is not effective and where it is not adequately resourced.  That is essential.  I cannot understand why this position has been taken.  We as a committee have to take steps to block that decision and to seek to have it reversed as a matter of urgency.  It is a good idea to have the Minister of State in.  I do not know when he will be available.  It will be in the new year and it will be some time away.  We have to act urgently now after hearing the presentations today.  I completely support the proposal made by Senator Kyne that we, as a committee, now write to the Minister of State expressing our serious concern about this proposal, that we say it is a retrograde step and that we seek to have it reversed by Friday.  We should do that in the strongest possible terms.  I suspect that there is support across the board for that kind of approach.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Quigley said she had requested a meeting with the Minister of State.  Again, if the Minister of State is not engaging with people who are working on the front line, how can he possibly have a clear picture of what is happening?  Apart from the formal meetings, it is essential that the Minister of State gets out and visits the area that is most affected by this.  This is particularly the case when we have a Minister of State who does not represent the urban areas that are most seriously affected.  It is hard to get a handle on areas where there are high levels of urban deprivation, disadvantage across the board in relation to housing, low levels of policing, lack of local health services, etc.  Poverty is the overriding factor.  All those factors contribute to drug misuse.

He has had our proposal for over a year now about what we wanted to do to address crack cocaine.  The &euro;500,000, to our understanding, is for the entire country to deal with crack cocaine.  It is for night-time economy piece, and it is for naloxone as well.  That is why we said that the figure lacks total understanding of the gravity of this issue.  We feel that the &euro;6 million in total does as well.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the &euro;500,000, there is &euro;1 million there - again for the entire country - to improve accessibly into front-line drugs services.

Those are fundamental issues, as well as the amounts of money, which are obviously crucial.<\/p> <p>  I return to the point that if the core funding of task forces had been increased every year since 2013 when the cuts ended, there would not be loads of money available but task forces would certainly be in a better position than they are now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Quigley"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hill and Mr. Hamilton; it is good to see them.

Crack cocaine is just another form of cocaine.  It is treated in a way that allows it to be smoked instead of snorted or nasally ingested.  It is an extremely additive substance.  It costs between &euro;10 and &euro;20 for a rock, which is then put into a pipe and smoked.  People are using insurmountable amounts of it in the course of a day.  It is an extremely addictive high, an extreme high, as it is a stimulant, and there is quite an intense comedown thereafter, which means people want to use it over and over again.  That is why it is having such a damaging impact on the community.<\/p> <p>  As I alluded to earlier, another problem with crack cocaine is that it has become a cottage industry.  It is being produced within homes, distributed by young people, sold outside shops and transported up and down outside our drug services every day by young people on scooters.  It has become an industry within the area that is targeting the most vulnerable people.  The data will show that people who start using crack cocaine are usually from already vulnerable cohorts and demographics.  It is people who are already vulnerable within our society who start using the drug.  They are building up massive debts by using the drug daily.  They are unable to engage with their healthcare and social care providers, or with any other support systems with which they would previously have been engaging.  Without being too sensational, crack is a game-changer when it comes to responding to the issue through a drugs strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Hamilton"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>What makes it such a game-changer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#G00600","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>There was a pharmacological treatment for opiates, which was what the original drugs strategy set out to do.  There was a medical treatment that could stabilise individuals so they could still engage in society and their lives, and which allowed them to achieve things academically and in employment.  Those things could be done.  Individuals are now losing their homes in the space of months, not years, and are sleeping rough.  In west Tallaght, people who reared children and sometimes grandchildren in their homes are now begging for money outside local shops.  That is the case outside every corner shop and petrol station.  That is in Tallaght, which is a suburban area.  I am not talking about the inner city.  That makes a difference to the landscape and the visibility of the issue.  Houses are boarded up.  People are unable to put out rubbish outside their houses.  This was shocking and controversial when we started raising the issue.  People were uneasy about the terminology we were using.  That shows how important it is for community projects to be on the ground and reporting realities.  That is the reality for a massive population of west Tallaght, and broader areas of Tallaght.  That is the importance of noting game-changers.<\/p> <p>  The drug is now embedded into the community and is not going away.  We talked about the need for residential services and treatment services.  All of those things are available if we can be resourced properly and get people on track.  We must remove the devastating barriers people are dealing with.  We are not here to victimise those who are already the most vulnerable individuals within our communities.  We are here to protect them, raise them up and ensure they have access to appropriate care and support systems.  That is what we need to do with crack cocaine.  It is not just about psychotherapy or drug counselling.  It is about ensuring these individuals are not sleeping rough and their children are not going into care.

Ms Quigley will know that the National Family Support Network was hugely instrumental in developing that drug-related intimidation report and programme.<\/p> <p>  Debt is a bit different with regard to crack cocaine use.  As Mr. Hamilton said, people are using bigger amounts of the drug more often and more quickly.  They are, therefore, building up bigger amounts of debt quite speedily.  As I said in my presentation at the start of the meeting, some women presenting to services have had to engage in prostitution in order to pay off drug debts.  That is frightening stuff.<\/p> <p>  We are trying to deal with the issue in Tallaght.  The introduction of designated inspectors to deal with the intimidation issue has been welcomed and has worked well.

The lack of practical supports is another resource issue.  Families need to have fire blankets on site in case things happen and they need them in the evening time.  Ringing doorbells and CCTV are also helpful.  There is a human element to the issue.

This is more relevant than ever due to the crack cocaine issue.  If we just wait for people to present to JADD, for example, to receive drug treatment to help reduce or stop their crack cocaine use, we will get a very small proportion of the crack cocaine users in.  It needs to involve a public health response.  It needs to reduce the harm within the community.  It needs to reduce the spread of blood-borne viruses which are leading to the deterioration of health in the community.  It certainly needs to involve that.<\/p> <p>  We need a multifaceted approach.  There is considerable growth in the need for case management.  We need to facilitate multiple agencies working with those very vulnerable individuals at the centre of this.  We cannot expect the individual to co-ordinate very complex mediation services and tenancy-sustainment issues while dealing with intimidation and poverty that might exist in the home.  There are serious challenges.  We need to be front and centre with the individuals to ensure we reduce harm, not just to the individual but to the family and community as a whole.  Any approach to this needs to have that.  We still do not know the full extent of this issue.<\/p> <p>  We have been doing an assertive outreach programme targeting individuals.  For every ten individuals we meet, we find five new individuals.  We have staff who have been working in the middle of Jobstown for over 20 years.  They are going five minutes up the road to these new housing estates that have been built in the past 15 years.  They never met these individuals before.  They are not connected to any other harm-reduction services.  There not aware of what JADD has done.  These people are using drugs paraphernalia.  They have no support or advice.  They are living in homes where very vulnerable people are.  We need a considered and compassionate approach that is multifaceted.  We cannot always wait for them to come in and want to make changes.  We need to get out there and help them.  We need to ensure we reduce the harm.<\/p> <p>  Children need to be front and centre in this.  We cannot forget that children are part of this issue and the solution must also involve them.  Destigmatisation needs to happen.  We cannot be using any terminology that makes individuals afraid to come forward when they want help.  People want help and support.

She hit on something crucial around the role of the community drug projects.  As we know, the HSE has a statutory obligation to provide treatment services.  If I were to go in for my treatment and had an issue with my children, that is not the HSE's role so it cannot deal with that.  It would have to pass me to somebody else.  The whole idea of the community drug projects is that they are able to deliver that integrated approach.<\/p> <p>  If I were to walk into my community drug project, I might not be able to think about my drug use because I am about to be evicted, or there is an issue around my children, or I am being intimidated.  The community drug projects can respond to whatever the issues are.  That is their core.  They were set up to be the place where that integrated approach is delivered.  The statutory agencies have their statutory obligations and it is essential that they deliver them.  What is unique about the community drug projects is that they can respond to all those needs.  Clearly, the childcare service is an essential dimension of the SAOL Project because when one is working with women, that need will arise.<\/p> <p>  It is crucial that we get what the community drug projects are about.  It is about being able to address the needs, at whatever level they present, of people and that is the kind of flexibility they have which the statutory agents cannot bring to it.  That is where the partnership is so important.  The statutory agencies are needed when those more specialist services are required.  We need the integrated approach when a person comes in to a service.  It has to deal with whatever the key issue on the table is for them and try to work with him or her on that.  That is a crucial element to the model.  We have it but we need to support it an awful lot more than we do at present.  It comes back to what Ms Hill said about success.  We know it can work.

I am slightly sceptical that society and the Government <i>in situ<\/i>can act on this situation.<\/p><p>In the past 25 years, the situation has come a long way.  The drug industry has evolved but have society and Government evolved in how to tackle this situation?  I would argue that they have not and have failed very visibly.  I have said this many times: we have to take a different approach to drug use in society.  The present policy does not work and is counterproductive.  We have to look at something different.  It is not easy.  It can be very ugly, but we have to do it.  Other jurisdictions have shown that with a different approach there are better outcomes for everybody.  It is worrying, as Ms Quigley said.  The community approach was the cutting edge in the 1980s and 1990s in the approach to drug use in working class communities that were literally obliterated and will always be the cutting edge in tackling drug use in communities.<\/p><p>There was a web seminar two weeks ago.  The figures CityWide released last week were literally striking.  Since 1996, there has been a 225% rise in drug deaths in Ireland and a 500% rise in drug prosecutions.  What does that say?  It says a lot in that the present policy does not work, and we have to look at something very different.  In the here and now in what is happening in the Tallaght area, obviously there is an issue with resources.  Fintan O'Toole wrote a really good article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on Saturday.  He said that if we look at what was given between 2010 to 2021, there has actually been a reduction in resources to drug task forces.  What does that say about society?

We looked at a very small sample of two evenings a week since September, and we have already encountered multiple individuals who we have not been in contact with before.

As Fintan O'Toole said, we need to learn those lessons of the past.  Task forces were established at a time of crisis.  Let us try to get ahead of this even now if we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Grace Hill"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses and thank them profusely for their presentation.  It was highly informative.<\/p><p>It was a modern look at an evolving campaign by the leading drugs people, including criminal gangs, etc.  It leads me to believe that we need a total re-evaluation of the way we deal with this issue.  We must broaden the scope and work of the drug and alcohol task forces, individually and collectively.  I speak as a former member of a ministerial drugs task force.  We learned a lot during that work, but it was undertaken some 20 years ago.  Since then, we have been beaten up by the growing breadth and depth of the illegal drugs industry.  To combat it, we must have the health services on board at the local and national level.  We must also have An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on board, as well as the teaching profession and schools' representatives.  I say that because they are at the coalface.  They see and know what is going on and they know that they are being beaten as well.  This interference of those involved in the illegal drugs trade is also making it impossible to give young people a reasonable chance of a reasonable education.<\/p><p> I do not want to delay the meeting, and I have other meetings to go to as well.  We must, however, re-examine the manner and means of how we are treating the drugs issue, including the use of methadone.  I refer to whether the current approach is working and is effective or if it is being tarnished by events around it.  There is no one way in which we can deal with this issue.  It is, though, an important issue, which must be dealt with sooner rather than later.  We should not be talking about this issue again in six months' time.  We must have something in place to deal with this issue in a new and modern fashion.  The crack cocaine issue is getting worse.  By driving through areas, one can readily recognise that drugs are readily available and that there is a big campaign by the people involved in illegal drugs to further expand and extend their market.<\/p><p> All that is certainly too big for the resistance campaign that we have under way nationally and locally.  We must go through what we are doing in this context again.  We must restructure and reform the drug and alcohol task forces.  We must also deal with the funding aspect and determine why we are reducing funding while knowing what is happening as a result.  In addition, we need regular reviews.  There is no point in going away, coming back to the issue in a year's time and then saying that things are not going well and that we must think of something else.  We must think about the required structures now.  They must be enhanced, empowered and provided with what is necessary.  If we do not do that now, then we will return to what will be an appalling vista in this regard in two or three years' time.  I mean an appalling vista whereby it will be visibly apparent to everybody that we have failed in our battle against the illegal drugs people.  That is all I wanted to say.  I have another meeting or two to go to and I have to chair one of them.  Those are the problems with the illegal drugs trade as I see it and I would be grateful for any comments.  I will certainly do my bit, as I know will all our colleagues on the committee, to try to bring to the fore the issues which have been raised and to respond to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#J00700","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Would Ms Hill or Mr. Hamilton like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#K00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I appreciate Deputy Durkan's comments.

I am not a supporter of allowing a certain level of drug use for personal reasons.  Drugs are a blight on our communities.  We must convince ourselves, for a start, that our approach is working or determine that it is not working in the context of when we are going to solve this problem or if we are ever going to solve it.  Alternatively, are we going to say it is necessary to accept a certain level of drug abuse.  That would mean that we would have to accept a certain level of abuse in the home, abuse of children and abuse of everybody involved and associated.  I refer as well to all the social issues entailed in that regard.  If we are forced to accept a certain level of abuse in any one of those areas, then we have lost the battle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#K00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Colm Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#K00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for their presentations and the work they are doing on the ground.

Turning to look at this issue in the context of funding, my understanding is that &euro;29 million has been allocated for the drug and alcohol task forces and that there are 24 individual task force groups.  The question is how that funding is used.  Do we have an idea of the breakdown of how that &euro;29 million is allocated?

The 24 drug and alcohol task forces are in place.  The local task forces were established in 1997 and the regional groups were set up around 2006.  In 2010, then, there were 24 drug and alcohol task forces.  No funding has been coming to the front line in the cases of any of the task forces.  That is the issue.  As I said at the start, we send in our pre-budget submission as part of the Estimates process.  The response from the Department unusually states that it has got &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million more in funding for this area.  The problem, though, is that not a lot of that extra money is coming to the front line.  I refer to the work being done at the coalface of this issue by Mr. Hamilton and JADD and all the other drugs services on the front line.<\/p> <p>  The Department will often state it is going to spend the money on residential beds, dual diagnosis or tier 4 services.  It already has its own wish list in this regard.  No additional funding has come to the front-line services in the last ten years.  This year, it is proposed that &euro;1 million for the whole country will be spread out to improve accessibility to front-line services.  The 24 task forces are competing for a share of that &euro;1 million, in addition to I do not know how many drugs projects also operating in those areas.

We welcome the recommendation in the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy which calls for a population-based approach.  This might be a way in which bigger areas like Tallaght and Clondalkin can benefit because we have such a big populated area.  We welcome that and we would hope to benefit from it.

It is based on the passion and the belief that we always want to provide the best possible services.  What I always encourage, and what I welcome, is for this conversation to look at not removing powers from community projects but encouraging the conversation that we should be investing more, professionalising the service more and making sure community settings and community front-line services are always to the best possible standard.  I would always encourage that conversation to happen in the future.<\/p> <p>  We have the best skilled staff in the community doing this job.  The challenge has always been, however, how we can continuously meet these standards without the funding and without the resources being put into it.  We are dealing with increased population size, increased insurance costs and increased social care, financial and clinical governance, without competitive salaries to keep skilled and educated staff within the sector.

We have the Garda superintendent on our task force and it is a very good relationship.  Equally, with the drug units, they are just a phone call away and I can report things and we can meet them confidentially as we need to.<\/p> <p>  What we need is more community garda&iacute; and our research has shown that is what we are lacking per head of population.

We welcome the introduction of drugs education at Templemore level, literally at entry level, so garda&iacute; understand the complexities of families that are impacted by addiction.

Luckily, we have great relationships with statutory bodies and local stakeholders such as Tusla, as well as charity organisations like Barnardos and others.

They were marginalised, disadvantaged and on the fringes of an already challenging community to live within at times.  Covid added enormous pressure on top of that in terms of food poverty and trying to manage utilities, keep the home warm and presses full of food.

People could not understand it because they were being told they were not allowed to gather as a family when up to 20 or 30 individuals were standing outside local shops.

Across Tallaght, specifically west Tallaght, every corner shop has large numbers of young people who are involved in the drug trade in some way standing outside it.  We are not saying that every one of those individuals is a criminal.  These are also vulnerable young people who have perhaps become mixed up in the wrong activities.  However, they are standing around each shop.  There are also orchestrated and sophisticated drug marketing gangs, who promote drugs through texts and social media.  Members of those gangs stand outside post offices every day to ensure that when people collect their social welfare payments or go to pay their utility bills for heating and electricity, they must pay back the gang first.  This is a stark and dystopian version of what is becoming a modern urban area.  We need to look at how we can sophisticatedly respond.<\/p> <p>  We have had great conversations.  As my colleague, Ms Hill, said, we have been speaking to community garda&iacute; and looking at how we can respond.  Those garda&iacute; told us that seizures are one element but they cannot just move people 100 yd down the road and allow them to continue to be involved in the same market.  I understand that challenge.  However, how are families meant to enter and exit their local shops or achieve any levels of recovery in the community while having to deal with that issue?  It takes us back to the same point, which is to ask how we can modernise the responses to this problem.<\/p> <p>  To return to the point the Chairman made about buddy systems, it is drug workers who will be driving down to a local shop to help someone pay a utility bill.  Drug workers can organise family support workers to ensure families can go up to the shops, pay their heating and electricity bills, and do their shopping.  These families need a lot of supports at these early stages of change.  They need to try to remove themselves from these communities.  However, gangs are using very sophisticated marketing strategies, as well as brutal intimidation outside shops.  The question of how we are going to respond must be brought into the modern conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Hamilton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I will come in on the point the Chairman made about the pandemic.  We are very aware that Covid-19 did nothing to slow down the flow of drugs at all.  Our sources in the Garda tell us that getting drugs in was not a problem.

However, we are hoping that the street work piece I mentioned will help to engage with young people in a more positive way.<\/p> <p>  I am also pushing through a number of inter-agency groups.  There is a need to build more capacity for young people.  They need more positive role models within the community.  Ms Quigley earlier described the situation that young people are now, unfortunately, looking up to drug pushers because they are the people with the Range Rovers and Canada Goose jackets.  We must show young people positive role models and we hope the street work piece will help in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There has been positive news within the community.  Since we launched the research three weeks ago, we have had a number of good responses from the community to say thanks and that it is great to know someone cares and is working in the background.  Those messages told us we need to keep going and pushing.  We must keep talking about the people who are not trying to destroy communities.  We do not want to put people on platforms, by any means, but we want to say we are not going to accept the situation.  We must keep going and raising the issue at forums such as this one.  It is important to keep the conversation going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Grace Hill"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I apologise for my earlier absence.  I had to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I was here during the CityWide presentation.  I know Ms Hill and Mr. Hamilton from an earlier debate.<\/p> <p>  The piece of work that the Tallaght Drug and Alcohol Task Force has done is very good.  Its findings are shocking, let us be honest.  Ms Hill earlier mentioned a tsunami of issues relating to crack cocaine.  This goes to the heart of the matter we discussed earlier with Ms Quigley.  The task forces providing services on the ground see these issues at first hand.  They collate the data, which is vital.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  When we try to tackle homelessness, the first thing the experts say is that correct data is needed so we can tackle the issues.  The same applies when we are dealing with drugs, alcohol and crime.<\/p> <p>  I apologise if I am being repetitive because I know Mr. Hamilton touched on these issues earlier but I have a couple of questions.  When I am in Dublin, I see gangs and people hanging around outside shops, post offices and facilities.  I have spoken to Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies Paul Donnelly, Ward, Ellis and the Chairman of the committee about the issue of intimidation.  I know the Garda has given a commitment, but have we seen a reduction in the numbers of these types of gangs involved in intimidation around shops, etc.?  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have raised the matter directly.  I spoke to our justice spokesperson, Deputy Martin Kenny, about the issue.  I see similar things in Cork, as does Deputy Quinlivan in Limerick, but the issue is particularly bad in Dublin.  The Garda has given a commitment.  Have our guests seen evidence of that working on the ground?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#N00400","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I do not know if Ms Hill wants to jump in on that question.

It is understandable that young people want to gather.  We have not seen a reduction in that.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies raising the issue of gangs.  We are constantly raising that issue with the Garda because it can be very intimidating within a community.  The street work piece is big.  We will get support from the South Dublin County Partnership to run a pilot programme.  I am sure other task forces could benefit from doing that as well.  Deputy Colm Burke earlier made a point about the great youth services that are available in the communities.  We need to be looking outside the box of formal youth services and examining new ways of engaging young people.  Not every young person wants to go into a For&oacute;ige service or youth caf&eacute;.  That is why it is important to look at projects such as Targeted Response with Youth in Dublin 8 and the Ballymun Regional Youth Resource.

Ms Hill touched on the issue of funding at the very start of the meeting.<\/p><p>People will probably say we keep beating that drum, but the facts are the facts.  The savage cuts the services faced from 2008 to 2010 have never been reversed.  One of the Government Senators said earlier there was &euro;6 million in the budget towards drugs and alcohol services.  We reckon it is &euro;4.2 million.  In the budget submission we in Sinn F&eacute;in made, the figure was &euro;47 million, with &euro;18 million specifically for the community sector.  Following meetings I have had with numerous task forces, community groups and service providers, it is clear we have to put the funding on the ground, at the grassroots where the people are.  If we are to make changes and tackle addiction, drugs and alcohol and support communities, we have to support the people on the ground.  The announcement in this year's budget was a disgrace given the problems that exist in addiction services and the need to support those in recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021120100002#N00700","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate the seriousness of the issue.

They will ask what we are doing and what is happening next.  They will ask whether we are protecting the communities and law-abiding citizens or just ignoring what is going on.  There is a grave danger.<\/p> <p>   It is understandable that those who are not directly affected will not feel the same way about it.  The points our guests have raised apply very strictly to the people who are directly affected.  That is a breaking down of society and community at local level, and of the collegiality that has always existed in this country in both town and city, to the extent other forces have intervened in society and now control it.  It is crazy.<\/p> <p>  I was not referring to the reinvention of the wheel but rather hoping to make the wheel stronger, better and more capable of dealing with the challenges that exist.  The weight on the wheel is growing, and whether it is capable of withstanding that kind of pressure will remain to be seen.

The population model and drug programme unit that has been proposed go some way to acknowledging that but I look forward to it being implemented.  It has been talked about for a number of years.

It is a challenge many are facing.  It is a lucky family that has not been touched by the drug epidemic.  It happens not only in cities but also in towns and villages.

We probably all know someone whose family has been caught up in the drugs scene with the awful consequences for those individuals and families.<\/p> <p>  We have touched on the intimidation that happens to individuals.  I have come across families where guns are being put in children's mouths.  Pipe bombs have been used and shots have been fired at houses.  People have been beaten up and even killed all relating to drugs.

In many cases the Garda's hands are tied and it is unable to support families in those situations.<\/p> <p>  The positive message the witnesses have brought today is that they have kept their services open and people move on.

Many Deputies will have spoken in the Chamber on the importance of this legislation, and how it effectively gives back to the local authorities by making them the first port of call for planning applications.<\/p><p>The strategic housing development, SHD, process deprived local communities of the opportunity to contribute to the planning process and gave them very limited recourse to appeal, a judicial review being the only option in many cases.  I thank the Minister for brining forward this legislation to bring an end to the SHD process.  It is crucial.  The previous Government relied far too much on the market for the types of homes that were delivered and on the belief that a fast-track process in itself would deliver homes.  That has proved not to be the case.  This is important legislation.  It will end the SHD process and ensure local communities have a voice in the planning process.<\/p><p> The Minister and I attended a community consultation with residents in Santry, it being a community that has seen significant development but that has had very little opportunity to contribute at the planning stage.  What was being provided was largely buy-to-let properties.  Those in the community wanted more housing to accommodate families with children and the people who lived in their community but what was delivered did not satisfy that.  I thank the Minister for coming to Santry to discuss these proposals with the community and talking through what this legislation would achieve. <\/p><p> The wording of my amendment differs slightly from amendment No. 43.  Amendment No. 43 seeks to include community organisations or representatives in the planning process.  A difficulty with that, with which other parties might also have a problem, is that it is difficult to define that.  My amendment seeks to use the structure known as the Public Participation Network, PPN, as one body that might be consulted.  There are different ways of consulting and involving the community.  If the Minister has a difficulty with some elements of my amendment, he might consider it and his officials might be able to improve on it.  Using both the PPN secretariat and the PPN itself would be one method of including the community at an early stage in the planning process without that in any way delaying the overall timelines.  We all know those timelines are very important.  It would not be my intention to delay the process in any way.  My amendment seeks to include communities, iron out problems early in the process and ensure communities have a voice and can contribute to the process, which the Minister have provided, at an early stage.  I thank him for that and ask him to consider the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#A00800","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the amendments.  As I did not get an opportunity to respond to the Second Stage debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il due to the time having elapsed, I want to put what we are doing here in context.  I welcome the broad agreement on the legislation.  It will reinstate the two-stage planning process and put planning decisions back in the hands of the local authorities, which is where they should be.  That is something in which I firmly believe.  These amendments relate to public participation.  Many residents felt they could not participate because applications were made directly to the board under the SHD process.  If people were not happy with that decision, while they had some input in a process through their councillors, which with I would not have been particularly happy, there was recourse to the courts through a judicial review.  We are reversing that now for these developments, and rightly so.  That means at the pre-application stage, on which I made amendments to the Bill in the Seanad, the records of a pre-application meeting with a developer must be kept and published, and the opinion on what is being asked for at the pre-application stage must also be kept and published with the file.  Resident and interest groups will get to make observations, and rightly so, on any planing application at the beginning of the planning process once the application is lodged.  A pre-application stage does not necessarily bring about an application.  We are also restoring democracy to planning at a local level, effectively, to make our planning system more efficient.  This is one of a number of measures the Government will bring forward.  This legislation will not merely stand on its own.<\/p><p>Effectively, we are restoring the input that we want people to have.  I accepted two amendments in the Seanad covering transparency of the pre-application process in order that people would know what has been discussed at pre-application stage, what has been agreed, what has been asked for and, furthermore, what opinion the local authority has given on the pre-application.  This is important and fundamental, and it is tied into the process.<\/p><p>We are ensuring people will be able to make observations to their local authority once an application is submitted, as should be normal in large-scale developments.  Furthermore, when any large-scale residential development, LRD, application is lodged, every elected member of that local authority will be advised, as a matter of course, and not on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, that an application and its reference number has been lodged and that it is in the planning process in order that local elected members are aware of what applications are in planning.  <\/p><p>I closely examined these amendments.  I wanted to give the overall context of what is being done under this legislation.  It appears the proposed amendment might have its origins in the initial process outlined in the general scheme.  It may also be that Deputies wish to amend the provisions in section 32(c) and (d) of the principal Act, as inserted by section 3.  However, as drafted, the amendment would technically provide for a further new consultation process, which could have quite significant impacts on timelines.  I do not think any of us want that.  <\/p><p>Deputy McAuliffe referenced a means of involving many different community groups.  The Deputy and myself met residents of Santry on the general issue covered in the Bill.  What residents wanted was a say in planning, and rightly so, and an end to the SHDs.  In this legislation we are restoring the primacy of development plans, local area plans and master plans.  Our planning must be plan-led and development-plan led.  Other contributions were made on Second Stage on ministerial guidelines.  I intend to examine that in the future and I take this opportunity to state that.  <\/p><p>However, in the context of this legislation and the fact we need to move forward on it and have the new legislation and regulations in place by 17 December, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.  Regarding the suggestion of how we might structure something around the PPN to make the process streamlined, I will examine that in more detail before Report Stage.  However, I cannot accept the amendments, as drafted.

I agree with him that residents want to have a say at the planning stage and the Bill grants them that.  Being aware of proposed developments at the pre-planning stage give residents more of an opportunity to be prepared for that process.  In particular, I ask the Minister to consider those sections that provide information at the pre-planning stage level.  Everyone would accept community organisations are not like a traffic department or a drainage department where they need to contribute in a technical manner but they should have an opportunity to at least have access to information early in the process.  Having access to such information would not in any way delay the process.  All it would do is arm them and perhaps clarify some of the issues they have in advance of the formal planning process.  Once the formal planning happens that conversation tends to be closed and the process moves on to a statutory level.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the Minister's comment that he will consider including the PPN system, or notifications through the PPN system, on Report Stage.

I fully support and want public involvement in our planning system.  That is why I am bringing SHDs to an end early and why I want to do that.  We will tease out this issue a bit further.  It is up to the Deputy whether he presses the amendment, and I fully respect that.  However, we will examine a mechanism that we could potentially bring forward on Report Stage, perhaps under regulations, whereby we could explore giving the public participation networks, PPNs, a role.<\/p> <p>  This aspect must be structured properly, though.  The definition of \"Community Organisation\" in the Deputy's first amendment is very broad.  What is it?  Do they have to be registered?  I have discussed this with Deputy McAuliffe previously.  If organisations are registered with the PPN, at least a formal channel would be in place.  It would mean that a group is not just set up as the \"Thomas Pringle Group\", for example, and then we could also have \"The Provisional Eoin &Oacute; Broin Group\", or something like that, where groups are just set up overnight.  I do not mean to be facetious.  However, we would need to have a structure, and potentially the PPN could be that structure.  As I said, I think we can do something in that regard by means of the regulations.  As we go through the Bill, the Deputy will see that we have vastly improved the input at the initial planning stage.  We are restoring that, and, equally, all the information concerning pre-applications must be published at the application stage.<\/p> <p>  Let us think about it this way.  Not every pre-application goes forward as a planning application.  When that does happen, all the records of those meetings and the opinions and information sought must be published with the formal application.  Therefore, there is full transparency, and rightly so.  Every time an application is lodged under the LRD process, every local authority member, namely, the councillors, must be advised as a matter of course.  We will see that as we move through the Bill.<\/p> <p>  As I said, it is up to the Deputy to decide whether he wishes to press his amendment.

It could be reduced to 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% or 10%.

One of the big challenges we have concerns brownfield urban development sites.  It has been said to us clearly that the 15% limitation in this regard was restrictive.  We are looking at some larger developments which we want to have that desired mix of cr&egrave;ches, shops, launderettes and whatever else.  To achieve that outcome, 15% was far too restrictive.  Therefore, we are saying that we should go to 30% and allow that to be varied, as is deemed appropriate.<\/p> <p>  This is a positive move which speaks to the experience we have had of a lack of development on brownfield sites in our cities, in particular.  It is genuinely considered that this proposed amendment would limit our ability to respond to possible future external factors, which could affect the viability of sites with which we already have issues.  The ability to vary by regulation the percentage of the LRD floor space that comprises a development would allow the planning system to respond to changing conditions and circumstances in certain communities, depending, for example, on what facilities are required.  I genuinely do not foresee a situation where we are going to see what the Deputy suggested.  We need more people living in redeveloped brownfield sites in our cities, but we must have liveable communities with facilities.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to cases where the amount of floor space would be varied to below 50%.  That is not going to happen.  The 30% maximum other use threshold in the Bill, and that is where it is set, will allow the relevant local authority, and it is the local authority concerned and not the board, to decide, based on the local development plans, what is appropriate in a relevant area on a case-by-case basis.  It is important to remember that context as well.  We must allow that ability, and it would be far too prescriptive to do otherwise.  This process is about returning planning to those who should know best, namely, local planners and local authority members.<\/p> <p>  The whole purpose of this legislation is to bring the planning process back to the local area and to the planning officials who know the prevailing local conditions and circumstances best.  It is better for qualified planners to do that, and to be able to make that distinction as applications come in, rather than for us to be far too prescriptive and restrictive at a general level.  If we are to restore planning for these large-scale developments to a local level, as I am going to do, and involve planners who know the area and who must have regard to and will be following the local development plan into which local councillors will have input, as they should, there must be a level of flexibility to allow for those conditions.  <\/p> <p>  Housing developments of this scale need local supporting amenities.  I realise the Deputy is aware of that point.  Such developments require services and other facilities, and planning authorities must be able to ensure that they are provided for in LRD proposals.  Therefore, this change I am bringing forward is a positive one, and I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.  They are far too restrictive and on a one-size-fits-all basis.  Allowance must be made for a local ability to vary specifications and to make decisions on a local level.  I think it is appropriate to do that, but I thank Deputy Paul Murphy for the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#C00600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

One of the issues that has arisen is the very significant increase in judicial reviews of decisions by the board with respect to SHDs.  A large number of those judicial reviews have been won.  In 90% of the cases that were won, the developer materially contravened the city or county development plan and the board approved that permission.  The cause of that conflict was not so much the SHD, but the mandatory ministerial or section 28 guidelines, in respect of building heights and inferior design standards for rental apartments and, to a more recent extent, the misapplication of the planning objectives contained in the national planning framework, which are very high level, overarching planning objectives that, in a number of instances, have been used to make a decision by the board in direct contravention of new county development plans, which, in some cases, have the approval of the Planning Regulator.<\/p> <p>  The issue is that material contraventions should only be in exceptional circumstances.

There was a great level of discussion on it in the Seanad as well.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 3, 9 and 37 relate to the issue of material contraventions of a local development plan.  Again, the purpose of this legislation is to bring planning back to have regard to the development plans.  The making of development plans - Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Duffy and other Deputies know this as well as I do because some of us have served as councillors - is a statutory process undertaken by the local authority, which is a reserve function of the local councillors.  The development plan is made with the advice of the executive and must have regard to proper planning and sustainable developments in the area.  Most of our local authorities are currently engaged in the process of the next round of their development plans.  However, certain circumstances may arise in the making of a planning application for lands, including land banks of strategic importance, where particular considerations may arise either in documentation lodged with the planning authority in the submissions received from elected representatives, members of the public or other committees, that require determination and may require planning permission to be considered, which would result in a material contravention of a development plan. This would be to ensure a sustainable or other appropriate form of development on lands the development plan or a local area plan may not have considered.  This is not like SHDs in that sense either, which brings me to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point.<\/p><p>He is right.  The reason many of these judicial reviews were taken is that there was no process at local level to identify where those issues were.  They were going straight to the board.  There were some quite infamous cases in which the board granted decisions having no regard whatsoever to development plans or local area plans.  There is a process set out in this Bill through which planning authorities must go if they are to undertake material contraventions of the development plan.  This may include the development of large-scale residential developments, as proposed in this Bill.  While the need for material contraventions has arisen recently in response to inconsistencies between adopted development plans, local area plans and, indeed, national policy including ministerial guidelines, the current programme of review of draft development plans being undertaken by councils, with the oversight of the Office of the Planning Regulator, which is important, will ensure that statutory local plans will comply with national and regional plans, in addition to relevant ministerial guidelines, some of which I will be reviewing, as I said earlier on.  This should reduce the need for material contraventions of development plans in future in the case of specific planning applications, and I believe it will.<\/p><p> Let us remember what the process is now.  Contraventions of the development plans, where required, are still a reserved function.  A very high threshold must be met.  No less than three quarters of the elected members must vote in favour of any such resolution.  This is considered a safeguard that provides for input into the process through the public consultation in addition to oversight by the elected members of the local authority.  The Planning and Development Act provides for appropriate consideration of all planning applications, including proposals for large-scale developments, as outlined in this legislation, with oversight and direction from elected members.  I do not consider it appropriate to remove the provision on material contraventions within the planning legislation.  Perhaps that was not the intent of the amendments but this would reduce the options for consideration of proposals which may be in the interests of proper planning and the sustainable development of a given area, on very rare occasions.  These proposals would obviously be subject to scrutiny and, rightly, the approval of the elected members.<\/p><p> Furthermore, clear direction is given to the board in section 37(2)(b) of the 2000 Act, as amended, on the circumstances in which the refusal of a planning application by a local authority for reasons of material contravention can be considered.  Such circumstances include situations where a proposal is of strategic or national importance, where there are conflicting objectives in the development plan, where ministerial planning guidelines, strategies or policy directives are required to be taken into account or where the pattern of development in the area is to be considered.  The board is therefore restricted to considering particular parameters in this matter.  Outright restriction of the board's ability to consider material contravention of a development plan for a large-scale residential development would potentially be counterproductive for significant housing developments, in particular where such proposals would be in the interest of overall proper planning or sustainable development in a given area.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 3, 9 and 37.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#D01100","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":683,"content":"<p>My amendment does not rule out in all circumstances consideration of planning applications where such applications include material contraventions of the development plan.  It asserts what is already in the Planning and Development Act, as amended, that is, that such requests to materially contravene development plans should only be made in exceptional circumstances.  It goes on to say that, other than in circumstances set out in regulations by the Minister, applicants would have to justify in their application why they are seeking to breach the city or county development plan.  The problem is that even though material contraventions are meant to be exceptional, not only have we had a litany of SHD applications that have breached development plans but they have been approved by the board.  These were then challenged and overturned in the courts.  Despite the fact that the courts overturned these applications, the board continued to approve other proposals for SHDs that included material contraventions of development plans.  This amendment aims to reassert the exceptional nature of such contraventions.  It gives the Minister the latitude to set out in regulations the circumstances in which these may be justified.  The fewer legal challenges there are to decisions, the faster planning permissions get through and homes built.  Therefore, if we introduce this additional check where the applicant will have to justify proposals for material contraventions of development plans with regard to regulations set out by the Ministers, the likelihood of judicial reviews being taken and decisions being struck down will be reduced.  It would therefore speed up and improve the planning process, thereby delivering much-needed homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#E00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":684,"content":"<p>From my experience in the architectural space, I know that developers tend to push the boundaries.

In rural areas, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given permission to developers to build large developments in areas where there are no transport facilities for school and so on.  The other issue is that, while county councils may object to developments, they have already been objecting to SHDs but An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been ignoring them.  That is concerning.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's recent track record has been one of just giving permissions.  It may then follow that a local authority may refuse a planning application on whatever grounds only for it to be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which will rubber-stamp it and say it is fine.

A local authority may point out a contravention of the development plan in the applications and say it does not want that.  If the application came through and the local authority, rather than the board, granted it, the elected members would still need to vote to contravene the development plan.  I take Deputy Duffy's point.  I have not been talking about any specific planning decision but I take the Deputy's point regarding some of the decisions An Bord Plean&aacute;la has made with regard to SHDs.  However, where a council has let it be known that it disapproves of an application, this has only happened through a consultative process by way of a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  These provisions are much stronger.  In the instance of an application for a large-scale residential development going through this process, the planners would have to agree to bring any contravention of the development plan to the members for a vote.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about exceptional circumstances.  How do we define such circumstances?  I take it that Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment No. 9 relates to the local authority planning system rather than the board.  There are existing provisions.

The problem is, as we saw with the SHD process - and this speaks to Deputy Duffy's point - a much higher number of material contraventions were sought, granted and then overturned in the courts.  If a local authority planning department approves a planning application that materially contravenes the county development plan, there is no requirement for a vote by the elected members.  People appeal such decisions to the board, which decides whether to proceed with them.

Deputies across the Chamber, both Government and Opposition, highlighted many of the difficulties with the scale and nature of large-scale developments under the SHD process, many of which are subject to judicial review and eventually overturned.  There seemed to be a sense from Members that this legislation, in and of itself, will resolve that problem but, unfortunately, it will not.  The reason is that a number of significant changes made by the previous Government, in parallel with the SHD process, will remain in place.  It is worthwhile considering these because, if we do not deal with them now, we will have to return to them at a future stage, just as we had to come back and deal with SHD.<\/p><p>As members will know, when Deputy Kelly was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the dying days of the most recent Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, he passed legislation making very significant changes to planning law that allowed a Minister, without any vote of the Oireachtas or local authority, to make substantial changes to planning law by way of decree.  There could, of course, be a consultation but, ultimately, it was within the gift of the Minister.  Previously, ministerial guidelines were made by way of advice and major planning policy was made by legislation or city and county development plans.  I have no objection to a Minister or a Government wanting to set standards and have consistency.  My view is that if they do that, they should have the approval of the Oireachtas and that, therefore, there should be a vote and not a unilateral declaration.<\/p><p>The mandatory ministerial, or section 28, guidelines have been used only twice, as most members will know, both times by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy.  One time related to building heights, removing the ability of a local authority in a city and county development plan to have any height restrictions.  I am absolutely not against height in appropriate locations, but I believe the city and county development plan is the best place to have those discussions.  More controversially, the then Minister introduced a two-tier system of design standards for apartments, where the original 2015 guidelines by the Department, which are very respectable in my view, apply to build-to-purchase apartments, and an inferior set of design standards was put in place as an option for build-to-rent.  Some build-to-rent, because it is higher end, sticks to the better standards but most do not.  That means renters get less natural light, less storage and a higher volume of student apartments in the development, and a higher number of apartments is permissible to core-shaft, whether that is a lift or a stairwell.<\/p><p>The problem is the national planning framework rightly wants compact growth, with far more people to live in our urban centres with greater densities, which means greater levels of apartment living, yet it is virtually impossible to buy an apartment in our urban centres, particularly in Dublin, because of the astronomically high development costs.  That means that if we want people to live in the urban centres, particularly Dublin centre, they have to be able to rent, yet we are saying they should accept lower design standards.  That is completely contrary to the national planning framework.  I know that many members of the Minister's party share the concerns I and others have about that two-tier set of standards.<\/p><p>These amendments will remove the ability of a Minister to introduce mandatory ministerial guidelines in the manner Deputy Kelly introduced them.  Such changes should be made only with the democratic imprimatur of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendments will also repeal both sets of mandatory ministerial guidelines introduced by Eoghan Murphy.  We tabled legislation on this previously and had a debate, where Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party opposed that legislation.  If we do not improve the design standards for rental apartments, which we need more of in order that people can live and rent in the urban centres, and if we do not deal with the issue of heights and what the best way to determine heights and densities is, something on which we are still waiting for the Department's guidelines for local authorities, we will have the same problems, even within the large-scale residential development process, which will lead to more judicial reviews at the latter end, something most of us would prefer not to see.  We want to see the best planning decisions made by the local authorities, with people on either side having the right to appeal to the board.<\/p><p>I urge members to consider getting rid of these regressive changes introduced by Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Kelly, in both the previous Government and the Government before it.  Let us do exactly what the Minister said he wants to do, although he will not do it fully if he does not support these amendments, namely, return the power to the local authorities and the development plan process to make those decisions in line with the national planning framework and the work of the Planning Regulator.  Let us remove these draconian, unilateral changes to planning law by any Minister, which have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever and should not be part of our planning code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#F00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 51, in the name of Deputy O'Callaghan, is related to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#F00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin made some excellent points and I have a similar view on the issue of heights and densities.  To promote more sustainable living, develop better infrastructure and public transport, meet our climate change targets and create more vibrant cities and urban centres, we need more density, but how we do that needs to be realistic and should be decided locally.  On Second Stage, I gave the Minister some examples from my constituency of where quite excessive planning permissions have been granted under the SHD process, which has resulted in areas that should be developed and built on and have homes delivered being considered unviable at present and possibly unviable for years to come.  Rather than this having facilitated the delivery of homes, it has been holding that up.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 51 seeks to remove the ability of any Minister to undermine planning guidelines set at development plan or local authority level through those mandatory section 28 guidelines.  It is welcome that the Minister said beforehand that this needs to be addressed.  It should be done now with our amendments rather than delayed.  There has been a lot of discussion in local communities about the problems of the SHD process.  While the problem is known as the SHD process, the actual SHD legislation is just a part of it.  Another part is the section 28 ministerial guidelines.  Putting initial decision-making back with local authorities is very welcome but leaving these guidelines in place will lead to more problems and conflicts.  The quicker we can address and correct this and bring it back to the way it was, the less conflict we will have through the planning process and we will also have more realistic and more viable planning permissions that can then be developed.  This is a key problem.  There has been a rake of speculative planning permissions and increased land values but this does not lead to homes being delivered because we are looking at densities and heights that simply cannot be supported.  Where they can be supported, it is only through the investment fund build to rent model, which is skewing the level and type of supply in certain areas without bringing about the kind of mix all of us would be supportive of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#F01000","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I have a lot of sympathy with the points made, particularly around ensuring the primacy of the development plan and the issues around height being a national strategy.

Any height strategy encourages height in some areas and discourages it in others.  Previous Ministers have taken that ability to have a strategy away from us.  My only concern with the proposed wordings from both Deputies is that they might also limit the Minister's powers to bring in positive measures.  The Minister recently stepped in to prevent student accommodation being converted into tourist or hotel-type accommodation and also stepped in with regard to co-living.  I wonder whether in trying to seek this change, we are also removing the power of the Minister to take positive steps.  I appreciate that local authorities are the places for these types of decisions but there are times when local authorities get things wrong.

We are getting rid of SHDs and restoring planning to local level and rightly so.  We are restoring local democracy according to commitments we made in the programme for Government that we are seeing through.  There is a real point in what Deputy McAuliffe said.  I do not dispute some of the issues that have been raised here and as part of the planning review that is under way about some of the issues around this but I think most people would understand that we need a consistent approach to policy areas such as student accommodation, co-living and other positive measures we may make.  If we remove the legislative provision to empower a Minister to ensure a nationally consistent approach to planning in all 31 local authorities, the three regional assemblies and An Bord Plean&aacute;la when we are implementing national planning policy, it would be very problematic.

The reason I say that is because the strategic housing development planning process and the section 28 ministerial guidelines on heights and design standards are a package and it is the interaction of that package that has caused so much conflict and led to so many judicial reviews and decisions by the board being overturned.  One cannot treat them separately.  I agree with the Minister that we need very careful consideration of these matters but that is what this session is for.<\/p> <p>  Also, the Minister is incorrect in his characterisation of the first of the amendments.  I absolutely believe a Minister should have the authority to bring forward proposals that try to achieve a consistency of planning across local authorities.  The difficulty I have with the current legislative framework is the Minister can do that without the vote of the Oireachtas.  If a Minister wants to make profound changes to planning law and to significantly restrict the scope of action of local authorities in their city and county development plans, he or she should, of course, have the right to do so but it should be voted on.  In fact, I suspect if the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy's mandatory ministerial guidelines had had to go to a vote of the Oireachtas in 2018 we would not necessarily be in the mess that we are in today because there would have been far greater scrutiny of those guidelines, particularly with respect not only to co-living but also to the inferior design standards for built-to-rent.  In fact, this is crucial.<\/p> <p>  I also want to agree with Deputy McAuliffe.  Something that frustrates me about the debate about heights is that those of us who opposed former Minister Eoghan Murphy's mandatory ministerial guidelines on the issue are wrongly described as being against height.  The Dublin City Council development plan identified 11 separate locations where high-rise buildings were permitted.  The issue, however, is that where high-rise buildings are built should be subject to a deliberative, consultative process and a democratic agreement in the city and county development plan.  Deputy Higgins knows well, for example, from some of the challenges in the Clonburris strategic development zone, SDZ , that issue of what was the most appropriate height in proximity to the train stations was a very significant matter of public concern.  Ultimately, a democratic process by the local authority, and then finally decided by the board, was the way that was done.  That is much better than a ministerial guideline and it is important to stress that.<\/p> <p>  I would also say that much of the debate around heights is misplaced because the real debate is about density.  If we want to increase the density of our city, we have to decide the best way to do that.  In fact, high-rise buildings are not the optimum way to achieve density.  Mid-rise, mixed-use developments achieve far greater levels of density.  In fact, you can even get density at low rise.  It is concerning that the local authorities still do not have the guidance on densities despite the fact that they are at an advanced stage in the development plan.  I do not accept the Minister's responses to the amendments.<\/p> <p>  I also think Deputy McAuliffe is a little mistaken.<\/p><p>There is nothing in these amendments that would have prevented, or could prevent in the future, the Minister issuing the kind of circular he issued recently about the change of use for student accommodation.  That would still be permissible.  This is about profound changes to planning law being made by a Minister without a democratic mandate.  That should be removed, as should the two sets of guidelines.  I will be pressing the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#J00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":707,"content":"<p>The Minister said he is going to look at these guidelines as part of the planning review so it would be useful to have as much of an indication as possible of the timeline for that.  I know the Minister cannot tell us exactly but it would be useful to have an indication.<\/p> <p>  Some good points have been made about how to achieve better density and that is not all about the height of buildings.  I have been flagging the point that some of the heights and density that have been achieved through planning applications for strategic housing developments have led to unviable planning permissions and areas not being built out.  An issue related to that has occurred in many of the larger areas zoned for development that have been earmarked to produce more housing and higher density, and which have been partially developed.  I am talking about areas that were zoned and on which development started before the crash of the Celtic tiger.  As a way to kick-start development after the crash, many planning authorities indicated they would allow lower density, two-storey development on part of these lands which initially had been earmarked for duplexes and three-storey, four-storey or five-storey buildings.  To compensate for that lower density and lower rise in some areas, the planning authorities stated they would allow for much higher rise and higher density in other, more concentrated areas.  The easier areas to build out have been built out at this stage.  The remaining lands that were earmarked for higher rise and higher density development are now these strategic housing development applications, which are effectively unviable and for which there is not demand.  That issue needs to be grasped and dealt with.  The best place for that to be tackled is at a local authority level, both for the reasons Deputy &Oacute; Broin was talking about in terms of the democratic process required but also because each area is different.  Each area needs to use local knowledge and involve planners in that.  The more we can involve the forward-planning sections in local authorities on this and the less that is done centrally, the better the outcomes will be.  Those matters go hand in hand.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister in terms of timelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#K00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I have nothing further to add on the other points but in response to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I remind people that we are returning planning to local authority level.  Many points have been made and I disagree with some.  It is the wrong place to be making drastic decisions such as those suggested.<\/p> <p>  The planning review is under way.  A significant review of all aspects of planning is being undertaken and we intend to conclude that by next September.  It is a sizeable piece of work that would usually take three to five years.  It is an extensive review.  I expect the work to be concluded by the end of September and the report will probably be published by the end of next year.  It is an extensive review.  The committee will have an important role in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The whole thing is about having a plan-led approach.  That is what we want and one of the issues with a lot of residences is that plans have not been abided by.  When we are setting zonings, development plans and master plans, we have, in some instances, not been prescriptive or descriptive enough about what is due to happen in each area, what heights and density are required.  Much of the time, residents will only find out when there is a planning application and it comes as a big surprise.  That should not happen.  We must change the way we are doing things so it is master plan-led and communities understand what is planned to happen.  I will add nothing further.  We have had a good discussion.

These were discussed in great detail in the Seanad.  There is no question but that all of us want to ensure we have adapted housing and universal design in housing for those with disabilities and we are certainly moving towards it.  I have a different point of view from the Deputy.  This is not a special planning process.  It is the normal planning process with strict timelines around delivery, because we need homes.  It is bringing them back to the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 11 relates to the considerations around universal design obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I explained this at length.  These matters are more appropriate to building control and standards legislation, rather than planning legislation.  It is important we have good and exacting standards in the local authorities and we are getting much better, but we need to produce much more.  People with disabilities spend much more time on the social housing waiting list than those on housing lists without special needs and that is why we are bringing forward a special plan for disability housing.  Amendment No. 11 is really around building regulations and standards and is not appropriate to this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The same argument goes for amendment No. 12.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 contains a number of actions aimed at promoting low-carbon construction.  We have the climate budget as well, so we are obliged to do that by law and will do so.  Amendment No. 12 is more relevant to building regulations and construction waste standards than to planning legislation.  It is already being addressed within the climate action plan.  That is not taking away from the reason, thrust or meaning in putting forward these amendments.  I fully understand that.  We all want to go to the same place on this and we are doing that.  However, these two amendments are not appropriate to this legislation and I cannot accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#R00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I expect a clamour of support from others on the committee for these amendments.

Staffing resources and so on that the local authorities do not have will be consumed to facilitate large-scale developments.  I do not see any reason they should not just go through the process under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  It is a special process and they will have access to the planners in advance, to try to get their development through in a contracted timeframe.  Given that, I want strings attached.  Frankly, I want strings attached to all development to ensure it is meeting social and environmental objectives.  We need more of that.<\/p><p>If there is a new process being established, it should guarantee equality for people with disabilities that we are required to deliver under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.

Amendment No. 15 seeks that information on pre-planning should be published online not when an application goes in but within a number of days of the local authority receiving it.  That is important for the pre-planning stage to work well, and there must be some engagement with the local community.  Some of the information and knowledge from the local community that is important in larger planning applications should be brought into the process at that stage.  Often with a large site or development, the local community has knowledge of it that the planners in the council may not.  The developer or its consultants may not have the knowledge either.  Sometimes this relates to water courses or potential landslides, for example.  There are many issues on which a local community may have knowledge and the developer or the local authority may not.  These are not matters of detailed design, as would be dealt with in the main process, but they are overarching questions that should be addressed at a pre-planning stage.  If there is no ability for a local community to know pre-planning is ongoing, how on Earth would it be able to raise any big, overarching or strategic matters at that point if, effectively, it is a secret or non-public process?  That is amendment No. 15.<\/p><p>Other amendments are in a similar vein.  Amendment No. 18 allows for public and not just community organisations to make submissions at a pre-planning stage.  Amendment No. 22 would make sure the minutes of pre-planning were online within a number of days of the process being concluded and not just when the application goes in.  Again, that is for reasons of transparency.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 26 states that the LRD opinion should be published online within five days of it being issued.  I have even provided an alternative solution to that in amendment No. 27 in case the Minister does not like my suggestion of the wording around five days.  Amendment No. 27 is a direct alternative to amendment No. 26.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 17 should be particularly easy for the Minister to agree to.

I also support Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments.  On a number of occasions, the Minister has said that he wants to move towards a plan-led approach to planning.  I completely agree with him on that.  However, there is not a wild lot of plan-making in this Bill beyond what is already available.  That is not a criticism of the Bill.  It is just not what this Bill does and, therefore, there will be occasions when large-scale planning applications come in without a plan, bar the city or county development plan, and the community will have, especially at the pre-planning stage, no involvement whatsoever.  I have not been in any way prescriptive in this amendment.  It is trying to establish the principle that some form of public participation in the pre-planning process is required and that the Minister and his officials will, by way of regulation, set out how that would operate.<\/p> <p>  The key principle is that the earlier we involve third parties in the wider community in the process, the better the planning outcomes will be for everybody because people will have a sense of ownership.  The Minister knows as well as I do that even in the best-case scenario, the two-stage planning process that is being reintroduced here, which I support, will still have an adversarial element to it.  An applicant puts in a planning application and third parties put in opinions, sometimes to amend and sometimes to object, but it often becomes a zero-sum game.  When planning becomes a zero-sum game everybody ultimately loses, whereas if there are occasions where communities are brought in before the formal application and statutory process, interesting things can happen.  We have seen that, for example, in aspects of the strategic development zone process and Part 8.  I urge the Minister not to say \"No\" to public participation during pre-planning.<\/p> <p>  I know he will not accept the amendment but I ask him to consider, between now and Report Stage, whether there are some mechanisms for involvement, particularly when a pre-planning process is clearly moving in the direction of a full plan.  That might identify some issues or problems through third party observations from environmental NGOs, other interested groups, such as heritage groups, or residents, which could alert the applicant and local authority at the pre-planning stage of something that could be ironed out then, rather becoming a matter of dispute or contention in a formal planning process.  There is merit in public participation at the pre-planning stage.<\/p> <p>  I have deliberately not been prescriptive.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment, I urge him to at least consider the proposition and come back on Report Stage with some thoughts on it.  This is not only about improving the process but removing the conflict and contention, and improving the level of dialogue and consensus, so we get better quality outcomes and less likelihood of appeals or judicial reviews because of potentially poor planning decisions that simply did not have full visibility of all the issues, which third-party participation might resolve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#T00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":771,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 41 is consistent with my other amendments.

If the Minister wants to look at the issue separate to that, it is perfectly fine with me.  It is about the principle of seeing whether there is a practical way to get some input in at that early stage.  That could be useful.  In particular, at the very least, allowing a local authority to seek those opinions by specifically mentioning community organisations, not just people, is a minimal approach to it.

Again, the context of this is that planning is being brought back to local authorities.  We know that.  On the pre-planning stage, section 32B(4), which is in section 3 of the Bill, provides that: \"The planning authority may, prior to the LRD meeting taking place, consult with any person who may, in the opinion of the planning authority, have information that is relevant for the purposes of the LRD meeting in relation to a proposed development\".<\/p><p>In broad terms, that gives the planning authority the power to seek other inputs at pre-application stage.  The important thing is that we want transparency.  How will we make sure there is transparency in the pre-application?  All pre-application notes, opinions and what is being sought, once an application is made, have to be published.  I made that change in the Seanad.  The information will be published, but only when the application is made.  Why is that?  Many people want to know what is happening in their areas, and I do too.  I will give the example of the strategic housing development, SHD, because it is the best data that we have.  There are 553 pre-application consultations under the SHD.  Of those, only 374 applications came about so 179 did not proceed.  By doing what I understand people are looking for, we would potentially publish much information about applications that will never happen.  It is best that when an application is lodged, the pre-application information must be published online, because it is live and we want to make sure people do not mix up the pre-application stage up with the application stage.<\/p><p> What I do not want to happen - and I genuinely mean this - is that people see the pre-application as important for dealing with issues.  At the pre-application, the council can seek stakeholders to come in if they so wish.  This is to try to make sure that we have good applications or to act as a filter and say, &ldquo;That is not appropriate, we do not agree, go away&rdquo;.  In those instances, subject to these types of amendments being as broad as they are, we would have to publish all of that information.  There could be numerous pre-application meetings on the same application that will never go anywhere.  It is most important to get the process right, so that when a development gets to application stage, people will know what will happen and what has been discussed at pre-application stage.<\/p><p> We should also remember, and this goes to the point about the involvement of the elected representatives, that every councillor in the area will automatically be told about every LRD application that is lodged by the local authority.  They will not just be told by way of planning lists, which can be sporadic insofar as some local authorities are better at issuing them than others.  Some do not issue them.  This will be tied into the legislation and it must happen.  We will publish it and I believe we should.  There should be transparency.  I also believe we should publish the right information when it is relevant.  We should make sure that the general public does not mistake the pre-application stage for the application stage and say, &ldquo;Well I've already had my say there and I'm not putting in my observations&rdquo;.<\/p><p> I understand what the members are getting at.  We have greatly improved the transparency piece.  Based on the data that I have, and it is probably the most comparable, 553 pre-application consultations were made, there were 374 applications and 179 did not go anywhere.  In some of the bigger local authorities, there would many people having pre-application meetings and publishing data that is not relevant to anyone.  The data becomes relevant when it goes in for application.  It is then that the information will have to be published.<\/p><p> Section 32B(4) allows for a consultation with stakeholders at a pre-application stage.  We have to remember why we are trying to do this.  We want a transparent, streamlined and efficient planning process.  We need good homes for people and members all know that.  Much of what is being looked for in that group of amendments is in this legislation already.  I cannot accept any of these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#T01600","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  I know I am not going to convince him to change his mind.  I would like to just press the value of involvement in pre-planning for him to consider.  A site in Clondalkin many years ago had been subject to controversial Celtic tiger-era planning applications.  The site was eventually sold to a new developer.  That developer wanted to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent before they went to formal planning application, they listened the views of the local community to see if they could incorporate them into the plan.  An informal pre-planning consultation took place.  It was not statutory.  It was by the developer in the community centre who met with local residents to say, &ldquo;Look folks, this is what I am thinking\" and asking for their views.  There was an interesting exchange.  All of the councillors from the area attended without holding a prejudiced view towards the development.  Significantly, the developer listened to the opinions of the local community and incorporated their opinions to the best of their ability in the formal planning application.  That dramatically reduced the level concern and hostility from residents in the immediate vicinity towards development.  There were virtually no third-party opinions in an area where there had been a controversial planning history.  Planning was approved and there was virtually no conflict.  That is a good principle.<\/p> <p>  Again, I know the Minister will not accept the amendments.  All I would ask him to do is, in the same way as with the strategic development zone on that macro scale, that we have significant consultation, well before the formal planning process.  There is a merit in trying to do something not too dissimilar with large-scale residential developments.  I urge the Minister to have a think about it.  There is value when communities are involved early, before the zero-sum game on whether they are for or against a planning application.  That can create interesting outcomes that improve the application, reduce the conflict and ensure everybody gets a better outcome.  I know we will not convince the Minister today, but I ask him to please consider the issue, engage with the Irish Planning Institute and other officials, as well as with his Department.  This could greatly enhance the process and reduce a level of conflict that causes great difficulty for applicants, third parties and for the planning authorities themselves.  There are ways of resolving some of that in the pre-planning stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#U00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I know this from my local area, where there are some large planning applications.  I can think of one where there was much knowledge in the local community about landslides in the area and about watercourses.  The developer and the planning authority did not pick up on these.  They were not in the pre-planning process that took place.  It all resulted in the developer not getting a successful planning application through.  To date, homes have not been delivered on that site.  However, if there had been good engagement with the local community at a pre-planning stage, it could have been a much better outcome for all involved, for the local community, for the developer and for the people who could be living in those homes now.  There is a huge value to this.<\/p> <p>  There is also the element that pre-planning takes up public resources.  Given that it takes up public resources, why then should there not be a wider benefit of those public resources?  The information and the lessons from the pre-planning stage should be made available and published online, whether or not this goes to a formal planning process thereafter.  Indeed, that information in terms of learning in a local community would be useful.  It would also be useful for other potential applicants in that area in that they would be able to see some of the key infrastructure issues that came up at pre-planning stage.  For somebody making an application themselves, it will be for a site that they own.  Information specific to that site will not be much use to anyone else.  However, having that information more widely available is a good that could come from this.<\/p> <p>  A mistake is being made in the approach.  The Bill is effectively deciding what the public wants to know about and when.  We have been getting clear feedback from the public and from community groups that they want to know about what is happening in the pre-planning stage.  The Bill decides for them that this information is not relevant to them and they are not to know it.  It is no one&rsquo;s intention to imply this, but there is the kind of narrative that people might not understand the difference between pre-planning and actual planning.  People will understand the different processes around it.  Certainly, people are interested.  Rather than making the decision for people that information will not be relevant to them or that they do not need to know, the Minister should let people have the access to information they want and are looking for.  That would give them more confidence in the planning system.  It would help capture the issues early on and have them ironed out.

Earlier, I said that I cannot accept the amendments as they are and that I want public participation.  We will see when we come back on Report Stage if there is a way, as has been suggested by a number of Deputies, whereby, maybe by way of regulation, we could issue circulars to local authorities.  I have seen the issues that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has described in my area.  There is a lot of good <i>ad hoc<\/i>pre-planning where a decent developer wants to find out what is going on, for example.  That should still happen.  However, Deputy Duffy is right in what he is saying, namely, that we cannot publish everything for every pre-planning application in areas of high development when you are trying to go through different iterations of applications.  A balance has to be found.  Everyone will know what happened at pre-planning stage in every application because that measure has been brought in.  Let me see if I can come back with something to address this.  I am not promising an amendment but I will try to come back with a method that we could use for those groups.  The term &quot;any person&quot; that Deputy Cian O'Callaghan mentioned is covered by the word &quot;groups&quot;.  I have clarified that with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in respect of amendment No. 17.  I will come back specifically on this matter on Report Stage.  We greatly improve the transparency and the consultation if people know what happens at pre-planning but I take the points that have been made and I will come back to see if there is another mechanism to address this.

We are talking about relatively small numbers of big developments that will have big impacts.  If you are talking about a big development that will have serious impacts but that could be beneficial and if you get people involved in the consultation on the ground floor rather than when the process is further advanced, you will get better development proposals.

If we were to do this, requiring the approval of regulations which set out matters of administration would be overly burdensome both for my Department, given that it is not being done for others and regulations are a secondary part of the legislative system, and for Members of the D&aacute;il.  It is long established that secondary legislation can be prepared and signed by Ministers as long as the principles and policies of the regulations are set out in the legislation.

I am not being rude.<\/p> <p>  I will say two things on this section.  First, we had an amendment ruled out of order but the Minister should take it on board because his colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are concerned and there was a vote at D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in relation to the staff resources that would be necessary in order to deal with large-scale residential development.  They will write to the Minister about this.  To put it starkly, the officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown said there could be cuts in other services because of the staff resources that would be necessary to deal with large-scale residential developments.  That is pretty serious stuff.  As a consequence, the councillors, including the Minister's Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, unanimously approved a motion to request that the additional staff resources be provided to local authorities to deal with large-scale residential developments.  Otherwise, this could have serious knock-on effects for other services.  The Minister should take that seriously.  It is not just me but everybody in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and the Minister will probably find the same elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The second point links to some of my earlier amendments.  I do not see why we need anything that is not affordable at the moment.  At the very least, there should be a higher requirement for public and affordable housing in any large-scale development than 20%.  We are in a bad state and are limited in the construction resources that we have, including construction workers.  There is only so many people to build stuff at the moment.  Everything has to be thrown at upping the amount of affordable and public housing we deliver, given the place we are in.  There should be no LRD process where there is not a requirement for an additional minimum of, I would say, 50% social and affordable to try to address the housing crisis.  I do not have an amendment in on that but I will put one in on Report Stage to the effect that there should be a higher obligation for social and affordable housing linked to any consideration of a large-scale residential development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#W01200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>This came up on Second Stage and I did not get a chance to respond because we ran out of time.

The Government has committed under Housing for All to provide resources to local government, has done so already in relation to housing delivery teams and will be doing more of that.  We need to resource them where needed.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  My colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown through Deputy Devlin and others have been on to me also.

It was raised with the Minister in the Seanad as well.  One of the few benefits of the SHD process was the presentation councillors received detailing the application process.  As part of that, their views were composited in a report submitted alongside the report of the manager.  Many councillors felt it was one of the few benefits of the SHD process.  I appreciate the new process does not allow that sort of combined submission by members of the local authority but that presentation was incredibly useful for local councillors.<\/p><p>In Dublin City Council, even in advance of SHD presentations, a presentation was made at the area committee meeting on significant planning applications.  I had not realised that was unique in that this process did not exist in other local authorities around the country.  The proposal made in the Seanad and by Deputy Nash today, which fell, was that this would happen at area committee meetings.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s concern that it could inadvertently delay the LSRD application.  Since this is not my intention, my amendment does not specify that the information should be presented at an area committee meeting or municipal district meeting but, rather, at a meeting.  It could be an online meeting or a physical meeting that is already scheduled.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.  It is important that local councillors be briefed by their councils on applications for developments of the scale in question.  It would benefit local democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#W02200","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 52, which is in the name of Deputy McAuliffe, is also in the grouping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#X00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":853,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 52 seeks a small change to the Title of the Bill.

I thought it was a retrograde step when it got to a stage where councillors could not receive a briefing.  A circular was issued some time ago, although not by me, whereby councillors could not call up files.  They did not wish to get involved in the planning decision but to put forward their views.  It used to work well in my local authority, for which I can speak.  I am considering what we can do.  The Deputy referred to Dublin City Council.  There is nothing to stop a local authority from briefing councillors when there is a significant application.  Some do and it makes a lot of sense.  The passage of this legislation will mean that every councillor will know about every LRD application in his or her area.  They will have to be informed about it.  They will be able to make a submission.<\/p> <p>  A good thing about the SHDs that the Deputy mentioned was the group submission by the council that went to the board.  The issue is whether any regard was paid to it.  Many councillors I spoke to felt they put a lot of work into their submission but that it got lost when grouped with the submission of the local authority, be it Final County Council, Dublin City Council or Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council.  It is different now because one is dealing with one&rsquo;s own local authority.  I am going to consider the question of how a local area committee or councillor might be able to engage.  I believed the planning meetings at local authority level were useful, if used properly. Maybe they needed to be changed a bit.  Councillors are not planners, and we do not want to muddy that line.  We know where the reserve function associated with the development plan sits.  We know where the executive function sits regarding planning but I am going to examine the matter.

My concern is that this part of the Bill will have the effect of tying the hands of the local authority, or planning authority, regarding decisions that have already been made through the SHD process.  I am referring to where there have been mistakes made regarding permissions granted, difficulties with unviable planning permissions, or densities and heights that are simply not viable but that may confer a speculative value on land.  The relevant sections of the Bill will tie the hands of local authorities and they will be prevented from making substantial differences if they have a good rationale for doing so where someone comes in for modifications regarding existing planning permissions or whatever.  If the change I am looking for were made, it would not mean a planning authority could simply, for no reason, seek significant changes.  The language of the Bill, as it stands, would tie the hands of a local authority where it has a good planning rationale, where it is conceded that there has been a lack in certain respects, where a permission has not resulted in building out over several years, where a permission is not viable although housing is needed in the relevant area, and where significant changes may be needed.  My fear is that the legislation ties the hands of the local authority, the planning authority.  I am trying to prevent this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#X01700","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I have a question on section 4.

I am sure he does not want to prevent local authorities from asking for information that, in their view, is necessary to make a decision.  I know, for example, in the official briefing we got from the Department, they were concerned about consecutive further information requests that could delay a decision.

I covered this on Second Stage and in the Seanad as well, but I am happy to go through it for members here.  First, we will publish the regulations this month in relation to further information.  I want to give members an idea of the limitations I am considering.  The limitations on further information would purely relate to matters that would reasonably have been expected to have been included in planning applications generally or as a result of issues raised or discussed as part of the pre-application consultation stage.  It is not my intention to limit further information altogether.<\/p> <p>  It will be possible to address matters raised by third parties during the five-week public consultation stage of a planning application, material issues which could not have been foreseen or raised at a pre-application stage, material errors in documentation and faults or deficiencies in environmental impact assessment reports or Natura impact statements, or other relevant environmental documentation, among other things, by means of further information requests as deemed appropriate.  They are the parameters of what I am considering.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments, the inclusion of provisions for the modification of previously permitted developments under the Bill seeks to provide legal clarity in respect of such applications.  Under the strategic housing development process, which is to cease, applications for modification are submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To avoid any type of gap in the legislation in respect of strategic housing development permission, given the proposal to reinstate the role of the planning authorities as the consenting authorities for large-scale residential developments through the Bill, it is deemed appropriate that applications for modifications to strategic housing developments as well as large-scale residential developments would be made directly to the relevant planning authority in the first instance, which is the correct way to do it.  Where modifications proposed to a previously permitted development are deemed by the planning authority to be very minor in nature, there is a provision in the Bill for the planning authority to determine that pre-application consultation is not required and that the planning authority need only consider the proposed alterations in determining the modification application.  This reflects the minor nature of some modifications that may be proposed and the fact that the large-scale residential developments proposals will have previously been subject to detailed pre-application consultation, thereby allowing for the most efficient use of local authority resources.

If, for example, a matter arises about which a local authority considers it reasonable to request further information, a decision which the regulation seems to conflict with, how will that be managed or adjudicated?  There are likely to be circumstances - we have not seen the regulations so we are speculating blindly on this - where a departmental interpretation of the regulations could determine that a planning authority's request for further information is not reasonable because it should have been asked at pre-planning stage.  The planning authority might disagree and say that this was not something it reasonably could have considered.  How will that be managed?

For argument's sake - we will publish the regulations this month - if a standard document or something like that is requested at pre-application stage that was not included in the planning application, it was not included and that is it.

I discussed this with Senator Wall and while I do not want to take away from the amendment's worthiness, the potential impact of it was not fully understood.  I get where the proposers were coming from.  They were concerned that lots of SHD applications were submitted and permission was granted but they never effected.

I would be very concerned about setting arbitrary timelines like this.  A 24-month or six-month timeframe, as detailed in the amendments, would not be attainable and we would end up with good planning permission grants falling and having to go back into the process again.  We had a good discussion on this in the Seanad and to be fair to Senator Wall, he understood where I was coming from.  On that basis, there is a use it or lose it piece that we need to look at.

It does not belong in this legislation at all.  I do not accept, and have yet to hear a convincing argument, that it is in any way related to LRDs.  My understanding is it is what is often called a leapfrog provision whereby on foot of a judicial review, where one party seeks appeal to the Court of Appeal, the other party can attempt to leapfrog the Court of Appeal and essentially fast-track a decision of the Supreme Court.  I heard the Minister's explanation of this in the Seanad, namely that it was designed to speed up the process and while I do not dispute that this is the purpose, he has not explained what process is being speeded up.  Only a tiny number of SHDs ever went to the Court of Appeal.  As we know, a large number were judicially reviewed and they stopped there.<\/p> <p>  I suspect this was not meant to be in this Bill originally.  I suspect it did not originate from the officials working on the replacement for the SHDs and the Minister needs to explain to us the origin of this section and why it is in this Bill.  Members will be aware that we are due to debate significant and potentially controversial legislation next year on the reform of the judicial review process.  Many of us are very concerned that this legislation will seek to limit people's access to justice but that is a debate we can have at a later stage.  My suspicion - and it is only a suspicion - is that somebody else, somewhere else in the infrastructure of government, wanted this provision in place in advance of the judicial review reform legislation because they anticipate this provision may be needed, potentially for large infrastructural developments, for example.  If that is the case, there might be a good reason for it and I would be open to listening to the Minister's arguments but in the absence of him credibly explaining why something that is not to do with residential developments is in a Bill on residential developments, I am left with no option but to oppose it.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Senator Warfield, raised the very same questions with the Minister and neither I nor he was satisfied with the response.  I urge him to tell us why this is here and what he is expecting it to be used for because if he did not expect it to be used between now and the passage of the judicial review reform Bill in the first half of next year, then it would not be here in the first instance.  A little more transparency around this provision would be better for everybody.  The Minister may surprise himself and actually convince some of us who are opposed to this section that it has merit.  He did not do that on the floor of the Seanad and I urge him to do it here at this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#Z01200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I have the same concerns about this section.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the judicial review reform legislation that actually predates this Government and goes back to the previous Oireachtas.  It is moving through slowly.  This provision is absolutely needed as a streamlining provision for any potential challenges taken against the State or a local authority or in instances where there would be a leapfrogging arrangement.  It is appropriate.  It is important that it is in place when we are trying to make the planning system more effective.<\/p> <p>  We are grounding this back with local authorities too.  I do not wish to repeat myself, but the whole purpose of this is to bring planning for these large-scale developments back to local authorities.  I believe this is appropriate to the Bill.  It is important that it is done and that we do not have to wait for the conclusion of the full review of the planning code of which we are in the middle.  I responded to Deputy O'Callaghan earlier on the timeframe in that regard.  I will be bringing other planning legislation through in advance of the planning review being completed.  Although members may disagree with different parts of the planning system, I think we all agree that we had to improve its efficiency while making sure the right to make observations or objections in support of or in opposition to applications is retained.  That is a right I firmly believe in.  This provision is relevant, valid and important and it is urgent that it is done.

Let us be clear that when this large-scale residential development process is in place, people will enter the pre-planning process and then the formal planning process and may then decide to appeal that to the board.  There may then be judicial reviews.  All of that will take the guts of nine to 12 months.  There will be no large-scale residential development that will need to access this leapfrog provision in 2022.  That is a reasonable assessment.  That means this leapfrog provision is for one of two other things.  It may be that somebody in the architecture of government wants to have this leapfrog provision in case it is required in the context of strategic infrastructure developments that are somewhere in the planning process at this point.  That could be entirely reasonable.  I am not suggesting there is anything untoward going on, but I think we should be told what that is.<\/p> <p>  Alternatively, it could be that somebody in the architecture of government and the Department is anticipating post-judicial review appeals to the Court of Appeal for strategic housing developments, including some of the most controversial such developments.  Again, that is anticipated before the judicial review reform legislation is in place.  My speculation - it is purely speculation and I am not casting aspersions on anyone because this is a completely legitimate thing for the Government to do - is that we have a very proactive Attorney General and this particular provision has all the fingerprints of the Attorney General, with his fulsome knowledge of the courts.  There probably is an appetite within the Supreme Court for such a leapfrog provision.  It would probably have a little bit more capacity to deal with such complex cases.<\/p> <p>  However, the question I genuinely asked of the Minister because I am open to being convinced on this - he has not answered it so I will ask it again - is what kind of development he expects this leapfrog provision to be used for between now and when his judicial review legislation, which I understand should come for pre-legislative scrutiny early in the new year and be passed within the first half of next year according to the timeline for it set out by the Department, comes into being.  This provision is not for large-scale residential developments.  None of those will even get to judicial review, let alone an appeal to the Court of Appeal, by the end of next year.  Is it for certain strategic infrastructure developments?  The Minister must know the answer.  Why can he not just be straight with us and let us know so that we can judge whether it is a good and worthwhile provision?

At present, if a planning authority, including the board, or, where relevant, the State, succeeds in defending a judicial review challenge and the High Court certifies that it may be appealed, the appeal then goes to the Court of Appeal.  If the planning authority or the State succeeds again in the Court of Appeal, the applicant or the objector can then apply to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal.  There are all of those different stages, all the way up.  Given the criteria for allowing an appeal from the High Court in the first place are very similar, although not identical, to the criteria that must be met for an appeal to the Supreme Court, leave to appeal is normally granted by the Supreme Court in these cases and would only be refused in exceptional ones.  This means that, notwithstanding having succeeded at High Court level in defeating a judicial review application, the ultimate resolution of the case could take another two or three years in the Court of Appeal and subsequently in the Supreme Court.<\/p> <p>  That is the reality of it.  It is obvious to most of us that this has adverse delay consequences for the proposed developments in question, hence the streamlining.  The amendment to section 50A makes provision for the planning authority and the State, or any party to the appeal, to apply directly to the Supreme Court in the event that the High Court gives an applicant leave to appeal, so they are then leapfrogged.  This would mean the Supreme Court would then hear the appeal, directly bypassing the Court of Appeal.<\/p> <p>  The introduction of these changes proposed in the Bill would have the effect of significantly reducing the time for the ultimate disposal of the litigation, although, obviously, it does not say what the judgment would be.  If the judicial case is refused, it would enable relevant projects to proceed earlier than otherwise would have been the case.  In my view, to repeat, this is a very important streamlining provision because court delays can impose significant costs or, in some instances, even inhibit viability.  Some objectors to developments can be very conscious of these delays as well, and if we are all honest with each other, we know that too.<\/p> <p>  It is appropriate in this legislation.  The judicial review reform Bill to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin refers will go to pre-legislative scrutiny and its general scheme was approved by the previous Government as well.

I do not see how the sections of the Bill, which obviously were amended in the Seanad at the Minister's request, achieved that objective.  Have I misunderstood that this is the legislative provision to achieve that end or does it have some other purpose?  I ask because not only do we need to ensure that apartments are included in this section, as the two amendments propose, but that this would empower local authorities to make decisions to ensure a percentage is for owner occupation.  The rate of 50% is arbitrary and the local authority should be able to make that decision based on the local planning need.

This is the first time that owner-occupier and home ownership have been recognised as a form of housing tenure.

Indeed, having a reference to first-time buyer will lead into, on top of a Part V provision, which is now increased to 20%, for them to designate an additional percentage for owner-occupier only, which I think it is a good thing.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, we have had issues with bulk purchasing.   This is not just a reaction.  This is something that we want by way of promoting home ownership and levelling the playing pitch.

Once it is in the development plan then that underpins the decisions that each local authority can make at the planning application stage.  Such estimate shall be deemed to be included in the housing strategy concerned, which will flow into the development plan and then flow into the planning permissions that are granted.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputies O'Callaghan and Duffy, section 2 of the Planning and Development Act sets out the interpretation of a house and that does include an apartment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#DD00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":919,"content":"<p>I support the intention behind the amendment.  I would like to understand how the text of the amendment relates to a previous commitment of around 50%.

So a local authority, in its development plan, on foot of a recommendation by a chief executive, if I read this right, could say the following.  In this part of the functional area of the local authority we have a very high concentration of private rentals so we would like the balance shifted to owner-occupation or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Therefore, it is not about setting a percentage centrally but giving the local authority the flexibility to set those percentages and then for planning applications to be judged against that.  Is my interpretation correct?  Would a local authority be able to say in its housing plan, on foot of these, that there may be certain areas where there might be an even higher percentage of owner-occupation than 50% or a higher percentage of rental than 50%, if that is what is required?

We want them to go further than that and outline where they need owner-occupier.

As Members will know, in the Land Development Agency Act, we have made provision for a base of 50% on State-owned land that will be developed for affordable and at population centres of over 150,000 such as Cork and Dublin there will be 100% social and affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#DD00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":921,"content":"<p>Section 2 of the Planning and Development Act includes the definition of a house that includes apartments.

I want to spend a little bit of time going through why in support of the amendments.  A small section of amendment No. 49 is missing.  It is probably my fault at the submitting end rather than the Bills Office.  I might come back to it on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  The original legislation Eoghan Murphy amended during the lifetime of the previous Government set the expiration date for the strategic housing development as December this year.  It was something that was going to happen irrespective of who was in government.  The current Government made a bad decision in accepting that the pause to the planning process in 2020 required a two-year extension.  The Government did so and it created a reasonable expectation among applicants that the strategic housing development process would come to an end in February.  Pretty much everybody understood that to be the case.  This is not what is in this transitional mechanism.<\/p> <p>  There are two transitional mechanisms.  It is important people fully understand their import.  The first is for those people who have already been in the pre-planning strategic housing development process for some time and who receive pre-planning approval to move to the formal strategic housing development application process by the end of December.  They are allowed move to full application.  This is a reasonable expectation because they expected to have until February to make a planning application.  What I do not understand with respect to this group of people is why the Minister is giving 16 weeks when for a year and a half we have all been told February would be the end date for strategic housing development applications.  Therefore, an eight-week period rather than a 16-week period would have been reasonable and legally sound.  It would have meant strategic housing development applications for this category of applicants would be made in and around August.  It is one of the things we would have had to live with.<\/p> <p>  My first amendment proposes shortening the period for the formal application to the board for a strategic housing development for someone who already has pre-planning approval.<\/p><p> The second category of transitionary arrangements the Minister made is excessive in the extreme.  It allows an applicant to put in a pre-planning application to the board for an SHD by 16 December, if 17 December is the enactment date, and the board will have nine weeks to make a decision, which takes us up to February.  It will then have 16 weeks to make the application, which takes us up to June, and there will be a further 16 weeks for the board to make its decision, which takes us up to October.  Conceivably, therefore, SHD applications could be submitted in the middle of next year, with decisions made in the autumn of next year, and some of them potentially judicially reviewed and having legal challenges running into 2023.  I do not understand why that mechanism has been put in place.<\/p><p> The full wording of the amendment, which should be in front of us today, although I will return to it on Report Stage, would not just have shortened the eight-week period but would have meant that in the case of anybody who only applies for pre-planning SHD approval at this point, the board would make that pre-planning assessment.  Instead of allowing the application to go into SHD next year, if the board gave approval, it would go into the LSRD process.  That would be much more sensible and it would do exactly what Deputy O'Callaghan is trying to do, namely, dramatically reduce the potential for controversial and unviable SHD applications to be made throughout next year.  I find it difficult to understand why we would be so generous.<\/p><p> I think the Minister is guilty here of making the same mistake he made with co-living, which was giving applicants too long a period from the announcement of a review, to the receipt of the report, to the announcement of the action, to the enactment of the action.  It is the same here.  People are getting an additional year for SHDs when they should have ended in February.  While I can live with a transition arrangement that takes us up to April for those people who have got pre-application approval, I cannot live with somebody just lobbing in a pre-planning application later this month and then getting a six-month grace period to make a full application, with a decision to be made in October.  There is no logic to that and I do not think it is necessary, which is why I will certainly press my amendments and why I also support the spirit of the amendments tabled by Deputies O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#EE03100","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I will not reiterate what Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined.

Obviously, something had to be done, but I cannot understand why we would allow people to come into this process at this stage.  Perhaps the Minister can explain it.  To me, it seems like a back-door loophole and an extension that is not needed .

We need transitional arrangements and they have to be there, as most people recognise.  To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, the process cannot be just cut off.  In the Seanad, the main Opposition party originally argued there should not be any transition but now it is proposing eight weeks.  We have to provide a transition.  If someone is engaging with a formal pre-planning process, applications cannot just be flipped over to the board.  We would be open to legal challenge and we cannot do it.<\/p> <p>  In order that Deputies are aware, as the Act that provides for SHDs stands and until we bring in this legislation with the provisions I am making, if someone has received a pre-application opinion from the board, he or she could lodge an SHD application in five years.  If anything, I am shortening that provision substantially.  That is what is happening.  It is not a loophole.  We are ending SHDs.  The idea that the planning pause during the first wave of Covid would not apply to one aspect of planning just does not stand up to fair scrutiny.  The Government committed not to extending SHDs, which we are not doing, and we are going further by putting in a better process that is more democratic and transparent and that will restore planning to local authorities.  We cannot accept amendments that would provide for no transition because that would not work and we would leave ourselves open to challenge left, right and centre.<\/p> <p>  The idea that anybody who has not even engaged will rock up before 17 December, lodge an SHD application and off they go is not the case.  There would have to be a section 247 application to the local authority and much of the work would have to have been already done.  In light of the number of judicial reviews taken against the SHD process, I do not see how it is an attractive process for anybody who has not engaged with it heretofore to come into the system.  A line is often peddled about co-living being extended for a period, but we banned co-living.  We had to send it out for screening.  Everybody knows that is the case.  It went out for 30 days of screening, which had to happen, but that was it and they are gone.  SHDs will be gone too because of this legislation, and that is a commitment both the Government and I have made.<\/p> <p>  I cannot accept the amendments.  We need transitional arrangements.  It will not mean a glut of new SHD applications will come in during the final week, in advance of their termination.  Applicants will have to have engaged with the process.  In the case of anyone who has not engaged with the process, new applications from 17 December will go back to the local authorities.  That is important.  It is being done in a very short space of time.  It is relatively complex legislation that, thankfully, has heretofore received the support of virtually all Members of both Houses, but transition arrangements are required.  What I have proposed are appropriate and realistic timeframes to allow for some potentially good applications we want to see through to fruition.  If they were flipped out into another process, it could very well end up further delaying the provision of more homes.  I am tired of seeing delays for many different reasons, some of them good reasons, in respect of the delivery of homes.<\/p> <p>  We need homes to be built.  The Bill will restore planning powers to the local authorities, which is what we all want to do.  I respect the Deputies for the amendments they tabled but I cannot accept any of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#FF00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":962,"content":"<p>I return to the second transitionary mechanism, for those people who do not have pre-planning approval from the board to make their SHD application, because that is the one I think the Minister has got wrong.  I say this in all sincerity.  My main worry is that applications could come in at a late stage.  They have only to enter the pre-planning application process for SHDs by 16 December.  While preparatory work will have to have been done beforehand, they will still be able to enter at that point.  The reason I think the Minister should seriously consider the proposition I am making, namely, that while that pre-planning application can be assessed by the board, it should be redirected into the LSRD process, relates to the fact that is a better process.  The Minister and I agree the LSRD process is far superior to the SHD process.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, a significant number of SHDs end up being judicially reviewed and delayed.  I would have thought, therefore, it would be much better to redirect those applicants that have yet to get pre-planning application approval into the LSRD process.  The reason some may not want that relates to the fact they might fancy their chances with the board.  The board - in my opinion, and I say this with the greatest respect to the individuals there - continues to make questionable planning decisions.  I say they are questionable because when they are challenged in the courts, the courts tend to uphold the challenge.  I see no reason anybody should be allowed to put in an SHD application as late as the latter end of June of next year, with a decision to be made in October of next year.<\/p><p>That is just far too generous.  It was never the expectation.  The Minister himself will know that there was a kerfuffle when a circular was mistakenly issued giving the impression that April would be the deadline for everybody, which would have been bad enough.  That was then withdrawn.  Then another circular was formally issued and it did not provide any clarity.  It was only when we saw the text of the Bill that we realised that the transitional mechanisms for those people only entering into the pre-application process would go throughout the course of next year.  I appeal to the Minister.  He is getting this bit of the Bill wrong.  Whatever about an argument over four weeks, I still think 16 weeks is too long for the first group of people in the transitionary mechanism.  Eight weeks would have been fine and we could have been done and dusted with all new applications by the end of February, which was everybody's assumption.  The Minister is getting this secondary bit absolutely wrong.<\/p><p> I wish to challenge the Minister on the pause because it is a very important point.  When the planning process was paused during the first lockdown, everybody knew that anything that was in the process at that point in time and that was affected by the pause would get an extra two months.  That was very clear.  None of the SHD applications that will benefit from the additional months into 2022 were affected at that point in time.  That was not the legal issue, as far as I understand; it was the timelines in the legislation Eoghan Murphy had passed to extend SHDs to the end of this year.  That could have easily been fixed by primary legislation.  We could have easily stuck to the original deadline.  If legislation had been introduced earlier this year, we could have had transitional mechanisms that dealt with that.  That is not my primary concern.  The Minister is giving new entrants to the system an extra year.  That is a mistake.  He does not need to do it.  I know he will not support the amendment, but I urge him to rethink some of this between now and Report Stage.  The Minister cannot say to people that SHDs are ending in February 2022 but that applications will continue to come in in June 2022, with decisions made in October and potential battles in the court into 2023.  That is not what people were promised and it is not what should be provided for in this section of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#FF00400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Boyd Barrett, to be followed by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#GG00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":965,"content":"<p>Will you let Deputy O'Callaghan go first, Chairman?

The point has been well made that if this legislation goes through, there will be a new system for people to be able to go into for large-scale planning applications, so it is not that there is not somewhere for new entrants to go and it is not as if they are being blocked or anything like that.  I think there are ample cases and ample evidence of not necessarily all applicants but some applicants availing of SHDs as a form of speculative planning application to result in increased land values and not in actually delivering homes that are needed.  That is what has gone on, albeit not in every case, so the sooner that is ended the better - certainly the better for housing delivery, good planning and people who are actually interested in providing homes.  The people who will lose out on this, however, are those looking for the speculative permissions, which some of them have got.  I have no doubt in my mind but that some of the decisions that have been made which effectively increase land prices and, arguably, because of the heights and densities, make development less viable and less likely to happen in the coming years, are actually blocking housing delivery.  Some of those decisions have been made as a result of this system and would not have been made if the original decision was with local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120100002#GG00400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I am not as well versed on this as everybody else here.

I am joined by officials from my Department, Mr. Seamus Clifford, principal officer, and Ms Martina Colville, assistant secretary.<\/p> <p>  A net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;22.9 million arises in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote this year.  This comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;45.9 million, which is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid receipts of &euro;23 million, giving a net requirement of &euro;22.9 million for the Vote.  The additional requirement reflects the ongoing front-line and visible nature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's work to support public health measures and counteract the impact of the pandemic throughout the State during 2021.  It is expected that the overtime spend will exceed the budget by some &euro;18.4 million, while payroll costs, excluding overtime, will require an additional &euro;7.5 million.  Overtime expenditure came under particular pressure with the enforcement of Covid restrictions during the year, particularly as society opened in early summer.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had to deploy preventative patrols in high-volume public areas in line with the outdoor summer policy, which was an overall success.  While the Commissioner has taken measures to address the overrun, I am informed that the expected additional requirement is in the region of &euro;18.4 million.<\/p> <p>  It was necessary for the Commissioner to extend the Covid roster arrangements for 2021, which impacted on the payroll subhead.  However, there are other contributory factors as well.  The impact of pay increases, particularly the superannuation parity agreement with Garda pensioners, has contributed to the additional requirements for pay and pensions.  An additional &euro;12.2 million is required in respect of this superannuation subhead.  The related pay increases were not finalised until 2021, which means no provision was made in the Revised Estimates.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate also provides in the region of &euro;2 million for the procurement of essential equipment purchases, mainly relating to ICT capital, to increase the organisation's agility and flexibility.  This includes the continued upgrading or replacing on a phased basis of the Garda ICT network, including hardware to support the continued roll-out of operational equipment and increasing demand arising from additional staffing numbers.<\/p><p> There is a technical aspect to the Supplementary Estimate in that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in receipt of Internal Security Fund, ISF, funding for certain ICT capital and other projects.  The ISF is a European Structural Fund which contributes to ensuring a high level of security throughout the European Union.  This funding includes investment of &euro;1.7 million in ICT capital equipment to combat cybercrime and &euro;1.7 million for upgraded equipment for the Garda helicopter.  The Supplementary Estimate is the mechanism for reflecting expenditure from this source and in total, expenditure is approximately &euro;4 million with a corresponding receipt of &euro;3.3 million in appropriations-in-aid.<\/p><p> There are various other overspends in the non-pay subheads including on telecommunications services of &euro;6.7 million, station services of &euro;4.8 million and transport fuel and maintenance costs of &euro;2.9 million.  On the other hand, there are certain offsetting costs available, including those related to the scaled-down activities and redeployment of resources from the Garda College for a period during the pandemic and surplus receipts from pension contributions.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the leadership and resilience Garda members have shown over the past 20 months through a very challenging period for them and for our society.  I know members will agree that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided, and continues to provide, a crucial front-line service to all our communities throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;3 million is required in 2021 in respect of the Courts Service Vote.  The Courts Service expects that the shortfall in court fees income will be in the region of &euro;7 million as a direct result of the impact of Covid-19.  This will be offset in part by underspends in gross expenditure of approximately &euro;4 million, thus giving rise to the additional Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;3 million.  The Courts Service has also indicated that it will have a capital carryover requirement of &euro;3.638 million from 2021 to 2022.<\/p><p> The increase in Courts Service business in the second half of the year will not be sufficient to make up for the shortfall in income in the earlier part of the year.  The shortfall also reflects the reduction in income due to the delay in reopening the night-time economy in the second half of 2021, underpinned by the Government decision to waive the licensing and special exemptions orders fees to support vintners, other licensed premises and the hospitality sector generally.<\/p><p> The shortfall in fee income has been offset in part by underspends in gross expenditure, including in areas such as travel expenses due to the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions, along with an underspend on leases when jury sittings were not held in the first few months of 2021.  On the other hand, there have been increased costs in other areas such as telecommunications costs arising from the increase in network connections to support digital courtroom sessions.<\/p><p> Throughout the pandemic, the Judiciary and the Courts Service have worked closely together to find innovative technological solutions that would enable them to maintain the highest level of court activity possible, with a particular focus on families, victims of domestic abuse and people who are most vulnerable at this time.  It is expected that the progress made on new ways of working will be maintained into the future.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is committed to driving the modernisation and digital-first agenda across the entire justice sector.  I particularly welcome the commitment set out by the Courts Service in its Corporate Strategic Plan 2021&ndash;2023, to maximise the use of digital technologies to provide an improved and user-centred service.  I am particularly pleased to note the steps taken to use video link and other technologies to the greatest extent possible.  These steps are welcome progress in the modernisation of services.  Substantial additional funding has been provided for the courts modernisation programme and I look forward to the positive outcome of this investment for the service in the future.<\/p><p> A technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required in respect of the justice Vote.  No additional funding is required for the Vote.  The technical Supplementary Estimate is required to utilise surplus receipts to offset additional costs in the gross part of the Vote.  This relates to areas such as payroll, as well as administrative expenses, including legal costs and contracted services, in functions such as internal audit and funds administration within my Department.  It is also needed for demand-led costs, particularly for criminal legal aid and custody issues schemes.<\/p><p> There are underspends in a number of other subheads such as compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted and the Coroner Service which are mainly due to timing issues.  These underspends are available to offset overruns in other subheads, thus ensuring a balanced Vote in 2021.<\/p><p> The surplus receipts are expected to be in the region of &euro;12.8 million and mainly relate to additional EU receipts of &euro;8 million and immigration-related fees of approximately &euro;5 million.  The additional EU receipts are mainly due to extra European Social Fund, ESF, receipts being made available to my Department by the managing authority, which is the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  This is largely as a result of reductions in claims in other areas of the public service under the ESF operational programme, which has allowed for additional justice-related funding claims in respect of qualifying expenditure in areas such as youth justice and probation in the previous year.<\/p><p> Due to uncertainty over foreign travel and other Covid-related restrictions, it was difficult to predict the intake from immigration-related fees in 2021.  While we expect a relatively small shortfall in visa and citizenship fees, there will be a surplus in immigration registration fees due to the renewal of existing registration fees and new applications coming on stream towards the end of the year.<\/p><p> I recommend the Supplementary Estimates to the committee and I am happy to address any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021120100002#A00600","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This is to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to get a head start on plans to deal with the likes of cybercrime next year.  As I said, &euro;2 million of the IT allocation was brought forward from 2022 to put the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into a ready stage going into 2022.  This is particularly focused on the computer aided control room, CAD2, project and protecting the network infrastructure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We have seen the importance of this in ensuring that, for example, &euro;800,000 is being spent on the network infrastructure firewalls to protect against cybercrime breaches of the network.  Another &euro;600,000 is being spent on F5 load balancers to support IT replacements and upgrades to enhance system performance.

I ask Members to put their hands up if they want to come in.  I will kick us off with a question.  There is a provision for an underspend of &euro;5.2 million on courthouses and offices.  As the Minister of State knows, there is a demand throughout the country for the revitalisation of various courthouses, not least Naas courthouse.  I made a point on this issue before, as I know Deputy Daly did.  We all have our own particular interests with which the Minister will be familiar.  Is the underspend because the money is being held back for a capital project in the new year?  I am not sure why an underspend is arising.<\/p> <p>  I will make a second point and the Minister of State can reply to both questions together.  He made reference in his speech to various arrangements that were put in place during the Covid pandemic for policing, which probably also apply to courthouses.  The committee has previously commented on the situation where trials for the entire Leinster region circuit were being held, for example, in Drogheda and, possibly, Trim courthouses.  A similar thing happened in other parts of the country.  There was an argument that another option might have been more efficient.  While there was social distancing in any venue identified on each circuit, people travelled to that court from around the province each day, sometimes for a case that involved a two-minute application and then they were gone.  A whole legal team, including staff and garda&iacute;, had to travel for that and there was expense associated with it.  I am not convinced that it was the most efficient use of resources.  I submit that perhaps it might have been better to use more local venues, which could equally have managed social distancing.  Given where we are with Covid, is centralising all matters to one or two courthouses per circuit, with the attendant travel that goes with it, anticipated to continue or is it expected that situation will begin to fall back and we will return to local courthouses, or local venues will be identified, where social distancing is possible? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021120100002#C00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>We are allowed to carry over up to 10% of an unspent capital fund from a particular year into the following year.  Due to the Covid pandemic, a number of building projects probably faced challenging situations when it came to spending money, which we have seen across the construction sector.  In that context, it would be expected that funding would be carried over.  As we know, there is an ambitious plan in the national development plan to refurbish and build courthouses.  We certainly hope that can be carried out as quickly as possible.  I understand that the Naas site will be purchased from the capital carryover to 2022.  That purchase is in process at the moment.  The funding is very much tied and connected to the situation in Naas and that is being actively pursued.<\/p> <p>  On other courthouses, Tralee courthouse, for example, currently comprises two courtrooms and is located on Ashe Street, as Deputy Daly will be fully aware.  There has been a challenge there.  For some time now, the Courts Service has been seeking a suitable site for a courthouse in Tralee.  A number of options have been explored in this regard, including the Island of Geese site, which is in the town centre, is in council ownership and is the preferred option.  Discussions between the Courts Service and Kerry County Council in respect of this site are ongoing.  Earlier in the year, the site was assessed as suitable for a courthouse development by the OPW's architectural services.  Evaluation of the portion of the site under consideration for courthouse development has been received from Kerry County Council.  That will, hopefully, allow the negotiations to be furthered.  It is understood that the disposal of the Island of Geese site to the Courts Service will require the approval of the full council.  A key consideration for the council in this regard is the future of Ashe Street courthouse when the Courts Service vacate it.  There are a number of moving parts around the Tralee site, but finding a solution to that situation is being actively pursued.<\/p> <p>  On the earlier question on clothing, every number of years clothing and accessories are tendered for on a competitive basis in a bundle.  I am told that it is tendered on a bundled basis rather than on a piecemeal basis year-on-year.<\/p><p>The situation in relation to other courts improved in terms of accessibility and trials as Covid went on as various courts improved their ICT equipment.  Particular ICT capabilities are needed to be able to use a court for a jury trial.  A number of courts had their abilities improved.  With the court modernisation, improving that ICT right across the courts system is a critical priority for the Courts Service and for the Department of Justice so that we can get all our courthouses up to standard as quickly as possible, but obviously during the Covid pandemic, everything is a challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021120100002#C00900","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>On subhead A2.6, as the Minister of State correctly said, there are currently two courts in the existing building.  That does not take into account all the spare space that is within the building.  There is enough space, in my opinion, for at least three extra courtrooms in the existing premises.  There was a review which, I believe, is outdated for a number of reasons, including, most importantly, the programme for Government commitment to town centres.  As the Minister of State said, we are moving towards a solution.  However, the solution might be a bad solution.  There needs to be joined-up thinking because this involves the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Justice, and there are a number of other factors.<\/p> <p>  Currently, similar to what was indicated by the Chair, for certain court trials in Kerry, witnesses, garda&iacute;, defendants and their families are all leaving the county and going to Limerick court.  That is completely unacceptable.  There is an opportunity now.  There is a true fork in the road.  With some of the other developments, such as ICT, there is less need for prisoners to come to court.  Many of the remands are being done remotely from the jails.  We need to look at this but there needs to be joined-up thinking.  I will not tell the buildings committee of the Courts Service, the members of which are all capable of making up their own minds, but their job is to provide an effective courthouse for the county of Kerry.  They do not have to factor in the overall benefit, not only to the town centre of Tralee but to the county of Kerry.  That is my job.  What they should be doing is looking at that in particular.<\/p> <p>  There is a building across the road, the old Kerry Protestant Hall, which could be for sale.  It was brought up at the Courts Service buildings committee that that building could be available for in the region of &euro;450,000, which, I suppose, might be going up.  There was a &euro;5.2 million underspend last year.  The Minister of State and the Government are the ones who can have the joined-up thinking, talk to officials in Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and talk to the architect who states there should be a review of this building carried out by a grade 1 heritage architect.  It was constructed in 1830 or 1840 from limestone in The Green, the town park in Tralee, by a 17-year-old apprentice architect, I understand, who was working with a very famous architect at the time.  It is central to the history and the heritage of the town.<\/p> <p>  We must keep the court service in the town for a number of other economic reasons that will not be considered by the Courts Service buildings committee, no doubt a group of very eminent and distinguished people.  We can do something that would be beneficial.  The common good of the town of Tralee demands it.  These are not requests.  These are demands that something proper be done.  If it is a simple box-ticking exercise by the Courts Service, no doubt it will think there is a brownfield site at the other end of town it should opt for, but there will be no additional benefit to the town centre arising out of the grant of the Kerry Group to the townspeople of Tralee for the old urban district council.  That shows how long ago that was donated.  With the capital carryover, there is a historic opportunity to do something, not thinking for the next ten or 20 years but for the next 70 or 80 years, to improve a town centre which has been hampered by out-of-town shopping centres etc.<\/p> <p>  We need to develop town centres.  There needs to be extra footfall.  As the studies, particularly in England, have shown, there must be increased jobs and an increase not only in the people living but in the people working in the town centre.  To generate an additional 100 people working in the town centre and people coming in on juries, etc., there has to be imagination and flexibility.  It is not good enough for the Courts Service to come back and say this does not suit it.  There has to be a fresh cross-departmental look at this before the wrong solution is made for Tralee courthouse.<\/p> <p>  There are, of course, other smaller courthouses, such as Castleisland and Killorglin, that were closed.  The local authority provided a courthouse in Castleisland, which is a town of 2,000 people.  It and other courthouses were closed.  Those decisions should be reviewed as well because they took more footfall away from those town centres.  I hope the Government will take that into consideration and listen to the overwhelming demand of the people of Tralee for a change in mindset about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021120100002#D00300","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly for his comments.

Unlike in many other professions, there has been no unwinding of the financial emergency measures in public interest, FEMPI, rates.  Indeed, people are beginning to leave those professions.  There may come a crisis point in terms of legally aided defendants and, indeed, prosecutions.  Various stakeholders would argue that is coming sooner rather than later.

Therefore, it is essential that whoever is facing a prosecution has the means and ability to be able to defend himself or herself.<\/p><p>Criminal legal aid is demand led and has two separate budgets.

I do not know whether that matter falls under judges' pay or the Courts Service.  I am aware of a person who has a terminal cancer diagnosis and wanted to put their affairs in order.  They asked for the earliest possible date to hear their case and this week or last was given a date of July next year.  The reason for this is apparently due to a shortage of judges.  Some very good judges were appointed during the summer and early autumn, but it is not good enough that the earliest High Court list to finalise a case for somebody when people are ready to go is July of next year, which might be too late.  Can more judges be appointed if that is what needs to happen?<\/p> <p>  On international protection and immigration programmes, we would be remiss if we did not mention the people who died in a boat in the channel last week.<\/p><p>There are people who want to say this all the work of criminal gangs luring people into boats.  That is complete rubbish in my view.  Appropriately at this time of year, these are Middle Eastern families - men, women, some of whom are pregnant, and children - who are putting their lives at risk in freezing cold conditions in what are probably the busiest shipping lanes in the world.  They are risking their lives crossing the channel to try to seek asylum in the UK.  If they get as far as Britain, most of them will be entitled to asylum because of the regimes from which they have fled.  The Dublin Protocol is in place.  It should be reviewed.<\/p><p> Can we step in as a country and make some sort of an offer to take some of them, because it is literally a life-and-death situation?  Can we get safe passage to some of them to bring them in, like the Syrian programme?  It could be a few people per constituency.  Wealthy nations in the West, and we are one, have an obligation to try to do something about it.  It is unacceptable in this day for us to sit back and not do anything about tragedies such as this when we are in a position to try to do something about them.  The numbers getting in and claiming asylum, not only in Britain but also here, is greatly down on what it was maybe 20 years ago.  There should be some room for us to make some sort of a gesture with this type of programme.  I see spending is down.  There is more money available.

Our courts remained an essential service during the pandemic and were allowed to remain open, but there were some very real challenges around capacity in the courts system that resulted in a backlog.  The Government is endeavouring to fill judicial vacancies at the earliest opportunity to ensure the courts have the necessary judges in place.  Five additional judges were created during the summer under the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.  A review of the need for judges across the different levels of the judicial system is being carried out.  Judicial numbers are being kept under review.  Appointments will be made as needed.  There are delays and I have no doubt the courts will prioritise cases in a compassionate manner as always, taking into account the serious situations some people find themselves in.<\/p> <p>  On immigration and refugees, as I said in the D&aacute;il last week, my deepest sympathies go to those who drowned in the channel.  Every one of those people only looked for a better life for him or herself.  They all have families and friends who will mourn their loss.  In my county, there were tragic losses of refugees and asylum seekers who were found in a container.  That anniversary is on 8 December.  We will mark that in Drinagh in Wexford.  We need to look at these situations with compassion.<\/p> <p>  I do not think Ireland has been found wanting.  We have taken a very robust and generous approach to facilitating refugees who are brought into Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has been very strong on that.  That is also true in this Department of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and me.  We moved quickly to put a policy in place to bring Afghan refugees to Ireland.  We were one of the first, if not the first, European country to put a system like that in place.  We called on our European colleagues to take a more European approach.  It is challenging.  There is no question.  We are bringing as many refugees into Ireland as we have the capacity for.  When you bring any refugee family into Ireland, there have to be the necessary supports available in education, mental health or physical, and depending on the refugees' individual backgrounds.  I stand over what the Department of Justice and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have done around bringing those in need into Ireland.  We are limited by capacity but we are keeping it under review always.  We are dealing with all these situations in a compassionate manner and we will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  I agree we must keep all these things under review.  The Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill will be back in the D&aacute;il this evening.  It is perfectly understandable that there are people who are trying to seek a better life.  Irish people through the generations have done that.  However there are people - the smugglers - who seek to take financial benefit from this and put people's lives at risk.  It is not to anyone's benefit that the smugglers can operate without consequences to themselves.  We have to ensure smugglers are caught and prosecuted but that those trying to seek a better life are not prosecuted.  The legislation we will debate this evening will ensure that is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021120100002#F00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the topic.

Yes, there has been a backlog arising from Covid but there is also a problem with the number of judges.  There is a problem with investment in access to justice both through civil legal aid and criminal legal aid, but also in the area of judges.  We appointed five additional judges, which was very welcome, but it must be put against the context of the President of the High Court saying she needs 17 extra judges.  That is just the High Court.  That does not include the District and Circuit Courts.  If we are appointing more judges in the District and Circuit Courts, they need to be free to move around and not tied to one district or circuit so they can be mobile and able to address the demand and waiting lists as they appear.  We absolutely need more judges.  We have 3.3 judges per 100,000 people compared with 21 judges per 100,000 in most European countries.  In rankings by international bodies that review the efficiency of justice systems, Ireland comes fairly low.<\/p> <p>  The point I wanted to make originally overlaps to a degree with the Estimates in subhead B10 for the Coroners Court.  There is an underspend of about &euro;5 million.  I would like to hear more about that.  What caused it and what are the problems behind it?  I asked a question about the coroner system during Questions on Promised Legislation.  There is a report from 2000 which recommended radical reform.  Research by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, shows this has not happened and the coroner system is under-resourced and regionally disjointed.  Deputies Gould and &Oacute; Laoghaire have been talking a lot about the challenges around the Coroners Court in Cork.  I am sure these problems are repeated everywhere.<\/p><p>In its pre-budget submission, the ICCL asked for a paltry amount of approximately &euro;300,000 towards taking the first step in a radical reform of and improvement of the coroner system.  If we have such a large underspend, we should be using at least some of it to deliver those reforms that have been advocated for by the ICCL.  I would like some information on how the underspend came about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021120100002#F00400","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case put forward by the Judiciary for an increased number of judges.  That is why the judicial planning working group has been put together.  We are looking forward to the report, which is being compiled independently by Ms Brigid McManus.  This is in line with the programme for Government.  We need to see not just how many judges are needed, but where they are needed at the various levels of our court system - District Court, Circuit Court and High Court - and what types of judge we need.  For example, do we need more specialist judges for certain areas?  We must assess these questions so that we can have an efficient and effective administration of justice.  We have heard the call for additional judges but, to put it bluntly, judges are not cheap.  They cost an awful lot of money.  However, our democracy is dependent on having an effective judicial system that people believe in.  We must have the necessary number of judges but we must ensure they are the right judges operating at the right levels and in the right places.  We look forward to the report.  It is expected to be ready next spring.  Once it is to hand, we will look to see how we go about implementing it.<\/p> <p>  The majority of the underspend in the coroner service relates to the Stardust inquiry.

Within Cork County Council, there are two distinct Gaeltacht areas, namely, M&uacute;scra&iacute; and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire.  The county development plan is currently under review and has been prepared having regard to other national regional guidelines, including the Gaeltacht Act 2012 and the national planning framework and regional planning guidelines.<br\/><br\/>Regarding our current county development plan from 2014, the planning policy framework for the protection of the Irish language is currently contained in chapter 12, on heritage, and section 12.5 on cultural heritage.  The plan acknowledges that Cork county has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, which is a significant asset to the county economically, environmentally, socially and culturally.  The current plan aims to encourage the further development of those cultural assets to increase local awareness of our heritage and the cultural identity and promote the cultural tourism industry.  A dedicated section is attributed to Gaeltacht and linguistic heritage under paragraphs 12.5.9 and 12.5.10.  Specifically, they state:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCork County Council recognises the importance of our linguistic heritage to the people of the County and to the cultural heritage of the County.  Parts of Cork County lie within the Gaeltacht.  These are Oilean Chl&eacute;ire, and an area to the west of Macroom and adjoining the Kerry boundary including Baile Bhuirne &hellip; and B&eacute;al Atha an Ghaorthaidh &hellip; commonly known as the Muscrai &hellip; Gaeltacht.  These areas require special treatment to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage without hindering development and with an appropriate response to opportunities and challenges.  The challenge is to promote these areas as a focus for development, whilst ensuring that the development, which does occur, supports or complements the linguistic and cultural heritage.<br \/><br \/>The Development Plan policy approach for the Gaeltacht areas is based on the following principles:  \t- The cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht areas, including the use of the Irish language, deserves fostering;<br \/><br \/>- An economically and socially vibrant community is a pre\u00adcondition for sustaining Irish as the community language of these areas;<br \/><br \/>- Recognition that the relationship between development and Irish language and culture is a complex one not amenable to simplistic measures, and also that planning powers have significant, though indirect and not unlimited, influence on the protection and promotion of culture;<br \/><br \/>- The [Cork Gaeltacht areas] are interdependent with the wider areas in which they are located.  They cannot function, or be properly understood, in geographic isolation.  The Gaeltachta&iacute; should play their full part in the life and well being of the County, Region and Country, and likewise should benefit from the resources of the territory around them; <br \/><br \/>- An isolationist approach, or one, which puts unnecessary obstacles in the path of development generally, would, in the current context, be damaging to the long-term sustenance of Irish language and culture in these areas.  <\/blockquote> <p>The specific policy objectives are listed under HE 5-3 in our submission.<br\/><br\/>I turn to what is proposed in the review of the current county development plan for 2022 to 2028.  As part of our current review, submissions were invited at pre-draft stage in March 2020 on planning policy matters, including linguistic heritage and Gaeltacht areas.  The framing of the new text and objectives in the draft plans has been informed by those submissions, in collaboration with the Irish officer and heritage officer.  Appendix 2 of our statement provides more detail on that.  The draft plan will also include a dedicated section within chapter 16, which relates to heritage, on cultural heritage.  Specific details relating to the Gaeltacht and linguistic heritage are contained in a dedicated subsection under paragraphs 16.4.12 to 16.4.17.  These include additional text on the Gaeltachta&iacute; in County Cork and the specific settlements that are part of these two distinct language planning areas, namely, Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire in the west Cork municipal district and M&uacute;scra&iacute; in the Macroom municipal district.  Recognition is also given to the Gaeltacht service towns of Macroom and Cork city, and Irish language networks as designated under the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  The draft plan from 2021 now considers the requirement for use of demanding linguistic impact analyses with planning applications for particular major developments.  Under draft objective HE 16-22, as suggested by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at the pre-draft consultation stage, this will apply in cases where the potential impact of the development on the use of Irish as a community language is not immediately apparent and pivotal in the determination of the application.<\/p><p>The expanded text and objectives in the draft 2021 plan are outlined as follows:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Gaeltacht Act (2012) provides a statutory footing to the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language, 2010-2030 and also recognises Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas (LPT), Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks.  Within Cork County, the Gaeltacht is divided into two Language Planning Areas: Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire LPT off the coast of Baltimore, and M&uacute;scra&iacute; LPT which includes an area to the west of Macroom and adjoining the Kerry boundary including Baile Bhuirne, Baile Mhic &Iacute;re, C&uacute;il Aodha, R&eacute; na nDoir&iacute;, Cill na Martra, Guag&aacute;n Barra, and B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh.  These areas require special treatment to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage.  The challenge is to promote these areas as a focus for development, whilst ensuring that the development, which does occur, supports or complements the linguistic and cultural heritage.<br \/><br \/>Cork County Council recognises the importance of our linguistic heritage to the people and cultural heritage of the County.  It also has an important role in the implementation of the LPT (Language Planning Areas) language plans, particularly as it relates to signage, service provision, and physical planning and development.  In 2019 Cork County Council produced the M&uacute;scra&iacute; Conservation, Management and Interpretation Plan, which provides a holistic view of the heritage of this culturally unique area.<br \/><br \/>As a stakeholder in the development and preservation of the Irish Language, Cork County Council supports the vision of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to &ldquo;develop a vibrant, thriving, sustainable Gaeltacht community and economy and to strengthen and sustain Irish as the primary community language of the Gaeltacht so that the Gaeltacht is a world-class region.&rdquo; [and] &ldquo;To foster a sustainable Gaeltacht community where the Irish language is the primary language, with a strong economy utilising all available resources sustainably and with a first-class standard of living.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>The Plan recognises the narrow employment base of the Gaeltacht areas and the unique challenges they face. It is acknowledged that tourism can play an important role in the employment profile of the Gaeltacht communities focussed on its unique heritage including its linguistic tradition, musical and traditional craft industries within a spectacular landscape setting. There are opportunities to create greater linkages and synergies between the Irish speaking population of the County (44.9%) outside the Gaeltacht areas and the immersive Gaeltacht experience. Within the Gaeltacht areas there are also notable artisan food and craft producers which can also contribute to overall experience and package of cultural offer within both Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire and M&uacute;scra&iacute;.<br \/><br \/>Gaeltacht Walks such as the Sl&iacute; Gaeltacht Mh&uacute;scra&iacute;, have provided important tourism infrastructure within Gaeltacht Mh&uacute;scra&iacute; and the Plan supports the further expansion of walking and cycling routes within both Gaeltacht areas, including &lsquo;hard&rsquo; and &lsquo;soft&rsquo; infrastructure for outdoor adventure, sports, recreation, etc., that can enhance the tourist experience of the area.<br \/><br \/>The Development Plan policy approach for the Gaeltacht areas is based on the following principles: <br \/><br \/>The cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht areas, including the use of the Irish language, deserves fostering; <br \/><br \/>An economically and socially vibrant community with a high standard of living is a pre-condition for sustaining Irish as the community language of these areas; <br \/><br \/>Recognition that the relationship between development and Irish language and culture is a complex one not amenable to simplistic measures, and also that planning powers have significant, though indirect and not unlimited, influence on the protection and promotion of culture; <br \/><br \/>The Gaeltachta&iacute; are interdependent with the wider areas in which they are located. They cannot function, or be properly understood, in geographic isolation. The Gaeltachta&iacute; should play their full part in the life and well being of the County, Region and Country, and likewise should benefit from the resources of the territory around them; <br \/><br \/>Cork County Council will co-ordinate with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the implementation of the LPT (Language Planning Areas) language plans, particularly as it relates to signage, service provision, and physical planning and development; <br \/><br \/>An isolationist approach, or one, which puts unnecessary obstacles in the path of development generally, would, in the current context, be damaging to the long-term sustenance of Irish language and culture in these areas. <\/blockquote><p>There are specific policy objectives in our draft plans to support those.<br\/><br\/>I will talk about zoning approach in the Gaeltacht areas.  At a settlement level, the key villages of B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh, Baile Bhuirne and the village of Cill na Martra have been allocated growth targets under the core strategy and additional text has been included in the draft plan, arising from submissions at a pre-draft consultation stage.<br\/><br\/>Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire is dealt with specifically under section 226 in volume 2, part 2, of the west Cork municipal district plan.  Additional text now reflects the completion of works on the development of a digital hub on the island, as per the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta submission.  Updated text is also included to reflect the fact there are supports in place to maintain the island as a functioning Gaeltacht.  Reference is also made to the fact Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire's language plan has been submitted for approval to An Roinn Turas&oacute;ireachta, Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n and has since been improved.<br\/><br\/>Further proposed amendments, which are now under consideration, arising from my chief executive's report of 24 September 2021, are as follows.  A further round of public consultation on the draft plan resulted in a series of further proposed text updates to strengthen the policy framework on the Gaeltacht areas via amendments which are contained in the chief executive's report and are due to be considered by members as part of the statutory planning making progress.  The submissions received are outlined in appendix 1, which was submitted to the committee, and the proposed amendments arising from those are outlined in appendix B of the longer statement submitted.<br\/><br\/>The current county development plan provides a dedicated section on the importance of placenames to the cultural heritage of Ireland.  This is supported by reference to the council's leaflet, preserving our placenames heritage in the naming of new developments.  The existing text and objective are outlined as follows:<\/p><blockquote>\tIrish placenames are an integral [though often forgotten] part of the cultural heritage of Ireland. They are a valuable source of knowledge [of the past, giving meaning to the landscape and defining the relationship between communities and their physical environment]. Much of the thought, folklore, genealogy, religion, daily life and work of those living in and interacting with their landscape can be appreciated through [the study of placenames] ... There are over 5,600 townlands in the County and over 100,000 references to [Cork placenames collected by the Cork placenames survey or the Cork placenames archive]. <\/blockquote><p>Cork County Council has also produced a leaflet, preserving our placenames heritage in the naming of new developments.  The purpose of this document is to encourage the use of existing placenames in the naming of new residential and other developments and there is a specific objective, from a planning perspective, which supports that.  The draft plan 2021 continues to include this text and has expanded the section to include townland boundaries.  I will not read through specific details of that.  It is effectively a slight change to the referenced townland boundaries.<br\/><br\/>From a procedural perspective within Cork County Council, we have the following development management procedures in place: the Irish officer is available for translation of policy documents and development management applications, translators from the translators framework are used for larger translation projects and clear guidance documentation is also provided for all staff.  Statutory bodies and agencies, as well as internal consultees, would be referred to as required on applications within the Gaeltacht areas.  No specific conditions have been attached to permissions issued on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire or within M&uacute;scra&iacute; Gaeltacht in the last decade.  Generally, an area planner assessing the planning application would have a degree of fluency in Irish.<br\/><br\/>There are no formal procedures in place for the assessment and processing of applications within the Gaeltacht areas of County Cork.  While preservation of the Irish language within Gaeltacht areas does not form part of the council's scheme of letting priorities for social housing, it is an issue the council would have regard to in the planning and acquisition of schemes and a member of the development management planning team has to attend the Gaeltacht planning working group organised by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in May 2021.<br\/><br\/>The housing department works closely with the two local approved housing bodies on nominations for both the capital assistance scheme, CAS, in B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh and Baile Bhuirne, but the ten units at Cluain R&eacute;idh, Baile Bhuirne, were allocated as normal via the choice-based letting system.  When the Cluain R&eacute;idh development was advertised, an extra line was added on choice-based lettings advising applicants that this development was within Cork's Gaeltacht area, if approved applicants wished to apply to live there.<br\/><br\/>Details of the scheme would also have been shared informally with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta which supports a number of local industries in the Gaeltacht area via the local authority's Irish officer and local councillors were also advised.  Efforts were made to encourage approved applicants who had an interest in living in the Gaeltacht area to apply.<br\/><br\/>It was thought that this might attract people who might not necessarily be fluent, but who had an interest in learning the language or in educating their children through Irish in the local schools.  However, interest was limited and all of the houses were allocated, but the majority of tenants came from outside Baile Bhuirne and were neither fluent nor interested in learning or speaking Irish.<br\/><br\/>There are three recent approved housing body developments in the Gaeltacht areas.  Cl&uacute;id has a ten-house scheme at Cluain R&eacute;idh completed in 2020.  Comhlacht Tithe S&oacute;isialta agus Forbairt an tSul&aacute;in has three houses in Baile Bhuirne under a CAS scheme under construction and Coiste Tithe Uibh Laoire Teoranta has three houses in B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh, under the capital assistance scheme, completed in 2019.<br\/><br\/>This council also has a site in Baile Bhuirne that could accommodate 14 to 15 houses.  Some preliminary design was done for an initial phase of ten, but it was decided to put the project on hold as there was limited interest in the Cl&uacute;id development and the council was unsuccessful in attracting Irish language speakers to the scheme.  With regard to Baile Mhic &Iacute;re, Baile Bhuirne, there are 30 families on the housing list, of which only one person has given an interest in the Irish language as the reason of his or her choice.<\/p><p>Demand under recent schemes has been low.  There are 11 families on the housing list for B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh and, apart from units for older people, only three units have been provided in the last five years.  There is a table in our submission showing the offers made and refusals received in respect of social houses in the M&uacute;scra&iacute; area.  These figures are not out of line with the rest of the county.  Cork County Council has two properties on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire in its ownership.  We currently have nine applicants seeking housing on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, eight of whom are living on the mainland and one of whom is living on the island.<\/p><p> Moving on to planning permissions granted for housing, the summary in our submissions shows that, within the Cork Gaeltacht areas of M&uacute;scra&iacute; and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, there were 148 grants of planning permission for individual housing units and developments of multiple units.<\/p><p> With regard to complaints in respect of the county development plan, the council acknowledges that a number of complaints about the plan and how the Gaeltacht areas are dealt with in different municipal districts were made in the media.  Chapter 16 deals with the overarching policy in respect of the Gaeltacht areas and includes a dedicated section on Gaeltacht and linguistic heritage.  The land use only approach for the lower order settlements of the M&uacute;scra&iacute; Gaeltacht villages and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire are included in the appropriate municipal district volumes.  This council recognises the discontent expressed by people from the Gaeltacht in respect of State and local authority support, especially with regard to planning, houses and services, as shown through movements such as Todhcha&iacute; na Tuaithe.  Cork County Council is involved with the wider working group and liaises with the Irish officers, planners and relevant practitioners in other local authorities.  We continue to engage with stakeholders on how best to support the Gaeltacht communities.  This includes collaboration with local Gaeltacht groups such as comharchumainn and Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta and with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and local language planners.  Cork County Council has also worked with the local group Acadamh F&oacute;dhla in M&uacute;scra&iacute; to produce the award-winning M&uacute;scra&iacute; heritage plan, which was approved by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021120100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Lucey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as sin.

For the purposes of clarity and explaining our position properly, I would be comfortable answering in English.  The Deputy raised the bot&uacute;n made in respect of Pairceanna na Glas.  While this is a fine scheme that is housing quite a high number of Irish-speaking people in a Gaeltacht area, there was quite a lot of coverage over the name, Pairceanna na Glas.  Like any organisation, we learned from this.  In my opening statement, I outlined that we have done quite a number of things to strengthen our approach in respect of the Irish language.  A very important structure we have put in place is the three-person independent committee chaired by &Eacute;amonn &Oacute; hArg&aacute;in and including representatives from the U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach and Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is Gaeltachts.  This committee will advise us in respect of specific matters in future.<\/p><p>One of the matters that comes under its remit is the naming of estates.  That has been a very important intervention.<\/p><p> Deputy Daly raised the issue of Airbnb.  I said in my opening statement that the level of short-term lets in a county like Kerry generally, and in Gaeltacht areas, comes into competition with the local community who are trying to acquire houses and raise their families.  They are the primary residents.  Killarney is an identified rent pressure zone in the county, so we have targeted it and we have seen the benefits of looking at the market and balancing around short-term lets.  It is our intention as a council to begin the same process as I have outlined in the west Kerry Gaeltacht.  We have done quite a lot of analysis on this and we can see there are a substantial number of properties and a very high number of short-term lets.  We believe those require further examination because they are being brought into direct conflict with local people trying to acquire and set up homes for themselves.<\/p><p> On some of the measures in the county development plan, as I set out, an awful lot of work is being done to try to support the Gaeltacht areas.  Deputy Daly will be aware we have multimillion euro schemes in development with regard to rural regeneration and Slea Head traffic management.  That project relates to tourism and we are working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on the tourism development plan, which includes the two Gaeltacht areas.  We are working with the U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach task force, and a Gteic is being established there with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  There is also funding of &euro;40 million, with &euro;20 million for regeneration and another &euro;20 million in amenities for the broader Cahersiveen area.  All of that will support the Gaeltacht areas.  There is a huge volume of work being done there, along with the sean-n&oacute;s sa Daingean project, which is an-t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn and do gach duine sa Daingean.  There is an awful lot of work happening generally.<\/p><p> Looking specifically at the county development plan, we have put in a measure holding 66% of multi-unit developments for the Irish-speaking community.  That is a very important move.  We have moved from 31% in the current plan and there is no percentage in the current plan for U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach.  We are hoping that is another measure that will lead to support.  While we do not have infrastructure and we do not really have hope of infrastructure coming, either across the county or in the Gaeltacht areas in particular, it is important we try to facilitate some limited type of development and accommodation for local people.  We have identified four settlements, two in the U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach Gaeltacht and two in the west Kerry Gaeltacht, that would facilitate small housing cluster developments with their own water and wastewater services.  We will try to encourage that and allow that within our county development plan in these four areas.  We are constantly trying to move and think of new ways of supporting our Gaeltacht areas.  In addition to the Irish officer, we have employed an Irish development officer for the county, who is looking at the Gaeltacht service town of Cahersiveen.  We have taken on this officer at a more senior grade because we need advice on how to develop and move.  We as a council need to keep moving to support the Gaeltacht and Gaeltacht communities.  That is the remit of the Irish development officer as well.<\/p><p> This has been an especially strong year for the development of Irish.  We are all aware that, during Covid, our communications and supports to communities have to be particularly strong.  We have been very focused on providing those supports and ensuring all that messaging is being provided through the medium of Irish.  We are very much focused on that.<\/p><p> The level of Irish was mentioned.  It currently stands at TEG leibh&eacute;al B2.

On the issue of persons from the Gaeltacht obtaining planning permission in the Gaeltacht, we would point out that our policies support local members of the community receiving planning permission within their communities.  There is no disadvantage to being from the Gaeltacht when applying for permission there; it is to the contrary.  When we made our development plan and rural housing policies our line Department referred to them as being exemplary in giving effect to rural housing policies.  In that regard we have sought to bring those forward into our draft development plan, which will be completed in 2022, until such time as rural housing policy guidelines are updated, which we believe is imminent.  Within settlements there is no impediment on people from the Gaeltacht receiving planning permission and again our policies are based on supporting people living in their local communities, be that in a rural area or within settlements generally.<\/p> <p>  C&uacute;il Aodha was specifically mentioned.  In broad terms we are rationalising our settlement structure within the county, which has resulted in a number of settlements, not just in the Gaeltacht but countywide, having their development boundaries removed and C&uacute;il Aodha was one of those.  We have had discussions with our elected members about including a list of communities that have had their development boundaries removed, recognising that they continue to be communities and an important part of our county and they will still be recognised by the county council and eligible for supports where appropriate.  The advantage in the delivery of housing in the Gaeltacht for people from the Gaeltacht will be that the removal of the boundary will mean that only people from that local community could obtain planning permission there.  That is significant in terms of sustaining the local community and there could be a benefit there.  We worked with the local community when we commissioned the M&uacute;scra&iacute; heritage plan and there is significant discussion of each individual community and the overall issues of heritage and linguistics within the M&uacute;scra&iacute; Gaeltacht in that heritage plan.  If there are any holes in the countywide development plan we have sought to address those by commissioning this plan, which is the first of its kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021120100002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as na cuir i l&aacute;thair.

We do not have the grid in our Gaeltacht areas but there are very significant works being done on the Dingle Peninsula with communities around energy generation.  In our draft plan we have made very strong commitments to micro energy generation which is, of course, community led and is the type of development we want to encourage.  We see that very much playing a part of the plan into the future.  I would strongly say that will be community led.  This will also help with language and in keeping some of the community funds as they are generated so that they will go back to the community.<br\/><br\/>On the Gaeltacht areas, I outlined previously to Deputy Moynihan that, similar to Cork, our Gaeltacht policy is around planning in the rural area.  It is a rural policy, pertains to the Gaeltacht area, and is very much about local people being facilitated to build a house in their local area.  It is strongly tied, therefore, to being local to the area.

These are people with an intrinsic connection with the language, a social and economic connection with the local area, whether it is a townland or a parish, or with the catchment area of the local school that one attended.

When one looks at the planning permissions granted that were mentioned, 148 of which were new dwellings and 165 of which included demolitions, rebuilds and some change of uses into houses, and one links that to three refusals over the period we have shown the committee, it clearly shows there is a very supportive planning policy in place.  Those refusals were on specific issues.  One could have been potentially in relation to wastewater treatment, which I will come to.<\/p><p> There are significant challenges, not just in Ballingeary but outside of the Gaeltacht area and through a range of villages that are deficient, to some or a very significant degree, in water and wastewater infrastructure.  It is not all of them but quite a few of them.  That is certainly a challenge to sustaining rural communities, not just Gaeltacht communities.  It is a challenge to Ballingeary, in particular.<\/p><p> It does not come directly within the remit of local government.  We clearly run the water services, in conjunction with Irish Water, but the capital investment programme that drives the improvement of water and wastewater facilities in those types of areas is driven by the availability of the funding at a national level to Irish Water and how it carves that up to meet its criteria for where investment should go for water services.<\/p><p> That is the particular issue there.  If one looks at our development plan, we have gone through every individual settlement, including those in the Gaeltacht, and we can show clearly where there is capacity or some capacity or where capacity is to be delivered in the next six years, within the lifetime of our next development plan.  I suggest that Ballingeary is one that is challenged in that way.<\/p><p> Where there is a community fund or a contribution from a wind farm developer who has received planning permission and is developing out, generally they are administered through the establishment of a local community group.  This group works and determines, in conjunction with the wind farm operator or developer, its priorities for the area.  We do not have a role in that.  I do not know the particulars and we should not discuss them here, but certainly, if there are particular ones Deputy Moynihan wishes to take up with us after the meeting to get a deeper understanding, we are happy to do so.  However, the community funds are there for the purpose of ensuring it is the community who influences how that spend is allocated and on what programmes, etc.  There should be opportunity there, subject to the appropriate consultation by the developers with the community and in the right framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021120100002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Lucey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>In terms of the mapping question, special areas of conservation, SACs, were given as an example.

I suppose that is easy to say.  Some are more easily delivered than others.  We would certainly welcome the standardisation of the Irish tests.  I do not that should be beyond the wit of man.  It should also not be beyond the wit of man to make some provision for social housing.  One point we are trying to make through the common statement is that there are a number of anomalies we have to operate with.  A member previously raised the question of preference or priority being given to Gaeilgeoir&iacute;.  The Planning and Development Acts do not make provision for such preference to be given.  The reality is that the more oppressive force here is rural housing policy because of the inherently rural character of the majority of our Gaeltachta&iacute;.  With regard to affordability issues, with the exception of M&uacute;scra&iacute; and R&aacute;th Chairn, the majority of Gaeltacht areas are coastal communities, which brings pressure in respect of affordability, demand and so on.  There are also limitations with regard to the planning regulations.  It is frustrating that, while we can apply language conditions, the enforcement of them is dubious at best.  I certainly would not like to sit in front of a High Court judge arguing that somebody should be thrown out of a house because they were not in compliance with the condition, whether at the time of sale or afterwards.  We operate them reasonable effectively but they operate in a sort of lacuna.<\/p> <p>  It is more about that overall consideration.  That is why we welcome the working group and this engagement with the committee for this high-level strategic view of the issues.  The biggest problems in the Gaeltacht areas, as in gach ceantar tuaithe eile, are fosta&iacute;ocht agus tith&iacute;ocht.  The simple reality is that housing has become a problem.  In our case, affordability has become a particular problem.

I will come back to what I view as the three more important ones that underpin everything.<\/p> <p>  The first recommendation is formalisation of membership and terms of reference for the working group on Gaeltacht planning matters, which was referred to earlier and was established earlier this year by the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Further work is needed on that.  As Mr. Walsh said, having that in place would be of significant value to local government and national Departments in order to work through these matters.<\/p> <p>  Second is the introduction of statutory guidelines by the Minister under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to specifically address housing and physical planning policy in Gaeltacht areas, as well as mechanisms for the implementation and enforcement of such policies.  That is critical because it is the basis upon which we can then take those guidelines at a local level and structure them in a manner that reflects the issues that are facing the various Gaeltacht areas, both commonly across the country and at a local level.  Without those, we do not have a basis for either a common approach of any nature or for an individual approach to the matters that are most particular to our two Gaeltacht areas here in Cork, or specific Gaeltacht areas in other counties.<\/p> <p>  Third, consideration should be given to the preparation of statutory local area plans for all Gaeltacht areas by local authorities, in consultation with the local communities and the relevant national agencies, such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That would certainly be of benefit.  It is a further manifestation of the local importance and local expression at a deeper level of what is important or intrinsic to a Gaeltacht area in a local area plan.<\/p> <p>  The fourth recommendation, which has been referred to, is for the use by all local authorities of a national certified method to assess linguistic competency.<\/p> <p>  Fifth is the introduction of national standards and guidelines regarding linguistic impact statements.<\/p> <p>  The sixth and seventh recommendations, in conjunction with the second, are critical.  One could argue that there is no point in having a national certified method to assist linguistic competency, or national standards and guidelines regarding linguistic impact statements, unless the legality of applying them in some way is assured.  We recommend the introduction of specific provisions in the social housing legislation that would allow for the prioritisation of Irish speakers in the allocation of social housing in Gaeltacht areas.  On the planning side of things, we recommend that clarity be sought from the Office of the Attorney General on the constitutionality and legal enforceability of conditions of that nature relating to the ability of occupants of certain properties to speak the Irish language.  Without those two critical things being clarified in legal terms, we will have difficulty in applying things that are not enforceable.  A non-enforceable condition is a worthless one.<\/p> <p>  The final recommendation relates to affordability issues, to which Mr. Walsh has referred.  We recommend the introduction of specific affordability measures in Gaeltacht areas.  We recognise that there is an affordable housing scheme and a strong commitment from Government to affordable housing but perhaps there could be a further definition of that for Gaeltacht areas.  Recommendations 2, 6 and 7 are the key ones that can enable local government to assist, in a more structured way, the sustainability of our Gaeltacht areas.<\/p> <p>  I would like to clarify one thing regarding the matters Deputy Moynihan raised.  There is no question of any disadvantage in any way for native Irish speakers or those from Gaeltacht areas in getting planning permission in those areas.  In fact, it is of benefit to have rural planning policies that recognise intrinsic cultural, language and social links to a local rural area.  That is of advantage to those who are in the area, as opposed to being a disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  On the mapping issue, we are on our final amendments to our draft development plan and we will be publishing that in early January.  As stated in the appendix to our submission, we will be mapping the two Gaeltacht areas in Cork county.  It is important to note that while they might not be mapped in the hard copy of the development plan at the moment, the mapping of all the Gaeltacht areas appears in our geographic information system, GIS, which is what we use for development management purposes and assessing planning applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021120100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Lucey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>I concur with Mr. Lucey and Mr. Walsh.  It is hard to differentiate the eight recommendations but from our perspective here in Meath, if we were to rank them in order, we would see recommendations 2, 4 and 5 as the most specific to us.  The section 28 guidelines speak for themselves across the board.  On recommendations 4 and 5, having an independent authority that can assess the linguistic assessments for applicants would be extremely beneficial for the future development of both the language and the culture in both the very small Gaeltachta&iacute; we have.  If we were to rank them in order those would be our three preferences to be dealt with first.  We welcome the establishment by the Department of the working group.

I cannot answer for that directly.  That is not avoiding the question but I have no legal authority to deliver water services; investment decisions are made elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  On planning policy and rural housing guidelines, we understand that the publication of new rural housing guidelines is imminent.  Maybe members of the committee will have more information on whether the specific issues we are raising here, including an Ghaeltacht and more supportive and definitive rural policy guidelines that support Gaeltacht areas, would be incorporated into that.  I am uncertain on that and I do not expect that there will be.  Let us wait and see what emerges.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of the R&aacute;th Chairn issue and our recommendations underpin that matter.  Michael Walsh said mentioned holiday homes and our Gaeltachta&iacute; are in rural areas that are either under strong urban influence or that could be classified as going through a period of rural diversification in tourism.

That is reflective of the lack of infrastructure and water and wastewater infrastructure throughout our Gaeltacht area, which is reflected in many other rural areas in the county.  Our rural policy in those areas is that one has to be intrinsically linked to the area, such as being a son, daughter or landholder.  Our plans do not support or countenance speculative development or non-family-home second home development.<\/p> <p>  We are drafting the development plan review and we are out for public consideration.  Similar to what Mr. Lucey was saying, we have had numerous meetings.  Public engagement is hugely important.

That was the first multiple application we received in R&aacute;th Chairn.  Meath County Council refused that planning application and it was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which granted the application subsequently, the outcome of which is known.  There has been no further engagement as yet with the applicant on the site.  Obviously, if the applicant can address some issues, the applicant can return with the application.  I made a point earlier on recommendations four and five.  Our desire has always been to have a third-party independent assessment of the linguistic testing and the resulting case proves our point to a certain extent.  If the working group was to continue and take those things on board and that was to develop, it certainly would aid our ability to decide planning applications more favourably disposed towards promoting Irish language and culture within our Gaeltachts.

I welcome all of them and thank them for the massive amount of work they have put into the county development plan, on which they are still working.  I appreciate all the work the councillors in Kerry are doing in that regard.  It is a very busy time.  I was involved in it at least three times.  I understand what goes on and the long hours.<\/p> <p>  Planning is a big issue in many parts of our county and it is a big issue in the Gaeltacht areas, because of the considerable scenery and views to be had.  While some people may not want any houses in areas like that, along the Gaeltacht in Cahersiveen or Dingle, people must put a roof over their heads.  The one ambition that every young fella and young girl has is to put a roof over their heads, to start a family and to rear their family in the area in which they were brought up.<\/p> <p>  Recognition has to be given to that and I welcome what Ms Murrell said about people looking for planning permission.  The one place I hope the objective is adhered to that they have to have family links, because sites and planning are in demand in those areas because of the reason I outlined.  However, we must see after young locals to ensure our culture, heritage and language in those areas is continued.  As it has been handed down to the present generation, we want to hand it on to the generations to come.<\/p> <p>  The big worry that I have is objectors.  When Kerry County Council finally grants permission and they go through the further information process and all that is satisfied, lo and behold, someone from outside the area objects to someone getting planning to put a roof over his or her head.  It is wrong and I worry about that.<\/p> <p>  I have no problem with people who have genuine reasons or are local and a new house would be impeding them in some way.  However, I take someone from outside of the parish or the county objecting to young people getting planning permission like this to be criminal.  I abhor that kind of action.  It is usually by people who are not working, have plenty of time on their hands and are on the dole and getting money for nothing, without doing any work for it.  That is the kind of person who usually objects.<\/p> <p>  There is a problem with short-term letting in some parts of the country.  However, in many parts of Kerry, a house close to or on a farm is being rented out for a short time to make up the yearly income and help a family along the way when it is not making the income it should from farming.  This is a help.<\/p><p>Those people should be left alone and allowed to carry on because many of these houses, if they were not being let or having some such use, would become derelict in a very short time.  They could not be maintained or their doors kept open if they were not allowed to do that.<\/p><p> I welcome and appreciate all of our guests who have attended here or on Zoom and I hope that they will continue the great work in the future that they have all been doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021120100002#Q00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta.

The Deputy also mentioned that these are very sensitive and fragile areas with many environmental and archaeological designations within them.  We try very much to find a balance between sustainable planning development and being aware and very much trying to facilitate local people who are trying to provide homes for themselves.  In the opening statement I also showed where quite a high number of these particular planning applications would appear to have been transitioning into permanent houses and homes in the Gaeltacht areas for people which is the objective which we are all trying to reach.<\/p> <p>  On the short-term lettings, I totally take the point that it is not something that is across the board.  It is targeted in those areas where it is competing with permanent homes, is driving prices up and is taking homes away from the local population.  I mentioned in this context the west Kerry Gaeltacht, where we are going in and examining the position.

I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;473.5 million for 2021.  The purpose of this is to address a shortfall in funding for my Department that is partially needed to fund the Christmas bonus for Vote 37 social assistance recipients.  There is also a net overspend caused by funding of Covid-19 supports during 2021.<\/p> <p>  I was pleased to announce that a Christmas bonus will be paid at the rate of 100% again this year.  As the committee will be aware, the Christmas bonus recognises the needs of people who are long-term financially dependent on their social welfare payment for all or most of their income, such as pensioners, people with disabilities and carers.  This year, those in receipt of jobseeker payments and the PUP will receive the bonus once they have been in payment for at least 12 months - down from the 15-month requirement of previous years.  It will benefit more than 1.4 million long-term social welfare recipients and is estimated to cost approximately &euro;313 million.  This cost is broken down into &euro;131.4 million for Vote 37 recipients and &euro;181.4 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The bonus that is paid to people in receipt of payments from voted schemes is met entirely by the Exchequer.  As the committee will be aware, there is a 2021 deficit on the Social Insurance Fund, which is subvented by the Exchequer.  This means that the Christmas bonus paid to those on social insurance schemes increases the fund deficit.  Indirectly, the Exchequer will fund the cost of this Christmas bonus in full as it will provide funding to meet this increased Social Insurance Fund deficit.  As the cost of the bonus is not included in the original Estimates for the Department and, unless equivalent savings on other schemes meet the entire cost, a Supplementary Estimate is required to ensure that the bonus gets paid.  In the brief provided to the committee, I have separately included the additional cost of the Christmas bonus to be paid for each scheme showing the effect of the bonus on the requirement for a Supplementary Estimate.  This table also provides the outturn position on the various schemes prior to the payment of the bonus, which eases comparison between the original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate.  I hope the committee finds this approach useful. <\/p> <p>  The balance of the Supplementary Estimate is required to meet a net overspend on the schemes and services delivered by my Department.  In May 2021, a further Revised Estimate of &euro;29.14 billion was considered by the committee for projected 2021 social protection spending.  This Estimate was based on Government decisions at the time that included that both the PUP and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, would cease after June 2021.  It was anticipated that income support for people who were unemployed after that date would be provided, where necessary, through the standard jobseeker income support schemes.  Given the fact that the PUP and the EWSS were extended beyond that date, we see overspends on these schemes and underspends on jobseeker payments.  <\/p> <p>  I will go through that in a little more detail now.  Both the PUP and the EWSS continue to be paid up to the end of 2021.  Covid-19 has fundamentally impacted the pattern and level of spending as compared with that projected in May 2021.  Spending on the EWSS scheme will be more than &euro;2.2 billion higher while more than &euro;700 million in additional expenditure will be incurred for the PUP.  The Covid enhanced illness benefit scheme will cost nearly &euro;67 million extra.  There are also areas of underspending.  In particular, jobseeker spending will be nearly &euro;1.2 billion less than anticipated.  This is largely due to the strength of the recovery in the labour market combined with the extension of the PUP.  I have provided the committee with full details of all schemes where the projected end of year Vote expenditure deviates from that projected in May 2021.  <\/p> <p>  The position of the Social Insurance Fund has also altered from the May 2021 projections.  Fund expenditure was estimated to be in excess of &euro;15.3 billion.  Spending is now expected to be just under &euro;15 billion - some &euro;347 million less.  PRSI income is now projected to be more than &euro;11.95 billion, which is &euro;825 million more than estimated.  This means that the subvention required from the Exchequer is significantly reduced.  Instead of an anticipated subvention of &euro;3.76 billion subvention, the required subvention will be &euro;2.59 billion.  This is &euro;1.17 billion or more than 30% lower.  <\/p> <p>  Taking account of the altered pattern of spending I have highlighted, it is now projected that overall social protection spending in 2021 will be &euro;30.54 billion.  This is a difference of &euro;1.4 billion over the May 2021 estimate.  Not all of this &euro;1.4 billion is being funded through the Supplementary Estimate.  There is additional PRSI income over that previously estimated of &euro;825 million.  The Vote benefited from additional income of nearly &euro;97 million, mainly due to more than expected recoveries of overpayments from employers on 2020 temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, claims.   Taking account of these, the total Supplementary Estimate required to meet the shortfall is &euro;473.5 million. <\/p> <p>  The expenditure giving rise to this &euro;473.5 million is made up of &euro;312.4 million to pay the Christmas bonus to long-term recipients of social welfare payments and in excess of &euro;23 million to bring forward to the week of the budget, both the &euro;5 increase in the fuel allowance payment and the change to the means test for the scheme, while &euro;138 million of the Supplementary Estimate refers to net overspending on the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services as set out in my earlier comments. <\/p> <p>  To conclude, I hope that my opening statement, together with the briefing material provided to the committee, has given it a clear overview of the Department's expenditure in 2021 and the reason underlying the necessity to seek a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#A00400","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her presentation and for the supplementary material, which sets everything out fairly clearly.  Much of it is self-explanatory.  It relates to a Christmas bonus and the continuation of the Covid measures.  That can be clearly seen in the figures.  It is worth saying that it is not all bad news.  The performance of the Social Insurance Fund and the PRSI take are very welcome and show that there is potential for our economy to rebound.  We are already seeing that rebound in our tax revenues.  That is helping us deal with some of the burden of the ongoing restrictions.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions.  There is an increase in funding for the non-contributory State pension of &euro;20 million.  Expenditure on the domiciliary care allowance is increasing by &euro;3.2 million.  Am I to assume that these changes relate directly to the increased budget allocations for those payments?  I imagine that is straightforward.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on PUP recipients, which I asked the Minister when dealing with Supplementary Estimates this time last year when we were all hoping that Covid would be in the rear view mirror by this point.  Do we have information about the PUP recipients?  Do we know what age they are, what sectors they work in or where in the country they are?  Are they on the scheme intermittently, coming in and out of it, or are they on it constantly, remaining on it for a long period?  If they have remained on it for a long period, there must be a reason they have not transitioned onto a jobseeker's payment.  What does that tell us?  Are they better off on the PUP?  I would imagine they are because otherwise they would have made the transition.  Does that tell us that we are looking at younger people or at people whose partners are still at work?  As we try to unwind the PUP and deal with the scarring to the economy, all of that will be very important.  <\/p> <p>  Speaking of scarring to the economy, one of the sections that jumped out at me and made me sad was that on working-age employment supports, the community employment, CE, scheme, the rural social scheme, the back-to-work enterprise allowance, the youth employment support service, the back-to-education allowance, JobsPlus, the local employment services, jobs clubs and the work placement experience programme.  The spend on all of these has decreased massively because the economy is not reopening in that way.  My question relates to the longer term.  We know there will be scarring in the labour market.  These traditional employment supports are not in place in large measure at the minute.  Is the Minister planning ahead?  When this pandemic finally ends, will she have some sort of action plan ready to put in place so that those people who may have been distanced from the labour market during the pandemic will have an opportunity to find their way back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#B00100","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The performance of the PRSI has been good.  That shows that people are getting back to work.  With regard to the extra spending on the non-contributory State pension, domiciliary care allowance and back-to-work family dividend he mentioned, the impact of the Christmas bonus is built into those increases.  For example, spending on the non-contributory State pension for 2021 is expected to come to &euro;1.085 billion.  This includes &euro;21.9 million for the Christmas bonus.  That is why there is an overspend of &euro;19.5 million.  Spending on the domiciliary care allowance for 2021 is expected to total &euro;203.1 million.  That includes &euro;4.2 million for the Christmas bonus.  This has resulted in an overspend of &euro;3.3 million.  Excluding the bonus, there would only have been a slight underspend on this particular scheme.  Spending on the back-to-work family dividend for 2021 is expected to total &euro;12.6 million, which includes &euro;200,000 for the Christmas bonus.  Spending on the Magdalen laundries scheme is expected to total &euro;3.2 million, which includes &euro;100,000 for the Christmas bonus.  Spending on the blind pension scheme is expected to total &euro;12.8 million, which includes &euro;200,000 for the Christmas bonus.  I hope I have outlined the increases in the different schemes satisfactorily.<\/p> <p>  I have a breakdown regarding spending on the PUP.  I can give the Deputy some of these figures, which are very interesting.  There are currently 54,824 people in receipt of the payment.  Some 31,687, or 57.8%, of these are men while 23,000, or 42.2%, are women.  With regard to the rates, this week, 17,000 claimants, or 31%, are receiving &euro;203 while the 37,818, or 69%, are receiving &euro;250.  On the age cohorts, 4,131 people under 25 are in receipt of the payment, which equates to 7.5% of the total number of recipients; 11,668, or 21.3%, are aged between 25 and 34; 14,802, or 27%, are aged between 35 and 44; 12,671, or 23%, are aged between 45 and 54; while 11,500, approximately 21%, are 55 or older.  I will provide the committee with a copy of this breakdown if it is helpful.  I have no problem in having it sent on.<\/p> <p>  I can only provide a broad outline with regard to the sectors involved because we do not really have any way of verifying what sectors people are in.  I cannot provide any great level of detail but these are the broad sectors recipients are in.  Some 1,000 people, almost 2%, work in an unclassified or unknown sector.  Those working in agriculture, forestry and fisheries total 867 or 1.6%.  Some 4,000, or 7%, work in manufacturing while 299 work in the area of electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply.  Some 5,540, or approximately 10% , of those on the PUP work in the construction sector.  The wholesale and retail trades and the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles account for 9,229, or 16%, of recipients.  Some 2,800 work in transport and storage while 8,227, or approximately 15%, work in accommodation and food service activities.  IT, financial and insurance services, account for approximately 7% of recipients while real estate activities account for another 7.5%.  I will jump to the bigger categories.  Some 3,000, or 5%, work in the area of professional, scientific and technical activities while 6,375 work in the area of administrative and support service activities.  Approximately 950 recipients work in public administration and 1,800 in education.  Some 2,000 work in the area of human health and social work activities while 1,325 work in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector.  Some 2,792 work in other services.  Some 12,557, or 24%, of those on the PUP are self-certified as self-employed while 39,545, approximately 75%, are employees.  That is, again, a good breakdown.  I will have it forwarded to the committee.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what we are doing to get people back to work, of course, a number of our services have not been operational due to Covid.  That is why there has been an underspend.  I had plans to do a roadshow around the country to encourage employers to meet with people who are looking for work and to link up with them but, unfortunately, I had to cancel that because of the new restrictions.  I intend to get out on the road again in the new year.  The new strategy, Pathways to Work, was published in July.  This shares the key aims of the programme for Government and sets out how the State will provide employment supports for the years ahead.  One of its commitments is to expand the caseload capacity of the public employment services, including both the internal services in Intreo offices and contracted services, by 100,000 jobseekers.<\/p><p>The focus of Pathways to Work is to ensure as many employment and training opportunities as possible are made available to people who are unemployed and they are supported in preparing and competing for these opportunities.  As the committee will be aware, there is a significant number of apprenticeship places and we have the work placement programme.  There is a number of different schemes there that we will be encouraging and working with people to take up in the new year.  I hope the restrictions will have eased off somewhat by then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#B00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>Deputy Carey is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#C00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to the meeting and thank her for her presentation and her continued engagement with the committee.

There is a need to reform CE to make people eligible.  I am aware the Department has carried out a number of reviews.  Could the Minister update the committee on that work?  When does the Minister envisage that a decision will be made, basically, on the eligibility criteria to make CE more easy to get into?

In terms of the CE supervisors' pensions, the starting point for this issue is, as the Deputy will be aware, the 2008 Labour Court recommendations.  We have had a number of discussions.  We have put forward a recommendation to the CE supervisors and my Department has been tick-tacking with them.  An offer has been made to them.  I hope that can be finalised soon and that we will be able to reach an agreement there.  I believe it is a very generous offer.  This has been a long-standing issue.  We have met with them and much work has gone into it.  I particularly acknowledge the work of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in reaching a solution to this long-standing problem.  It is with the supervisors at present and there have been discussions with the unions.  We hope we will be able to bring that to closure soon.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the carers, Deputy Carey mentioned the different supports that we have.  As the Deputy will be aware, in the budget we certainly improved what the offering was for carers.  It was something that I was keen to do.  The Government recognises the important role that family carers play in Irish society and we are fully committed to support them through a range of supports and services.  The main income supports for carers provided by the Department included carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary carer's allowance and the carer's support grant and spending on these payments, in 2021, is expected to amount to &euro;1.5 billion.  I was glad that I was able to improve the means test.  I note that is something Deputy Carey wanted but it is something that the Chair, and, indeed, the other members of the committee, also raised with me on a number of occasions.  We did that in the budget and that will come into effect next year.  That means that you can earn more and still qualify for the carer's payment.  The carers' groups across the country were very glad and there was widespread acknowledgement that this was a good thing to do.  Of course, I increased the weekly carer's allowance payment by &euro;5.  The carer's support grant is at &euro;1,850.  That is the highest level it has ever been at.  As a result of the changes that I made in the budget, a couple can earn up to &euro;750 a week and the first &euro;50,000 in savings will not be counted in the means test.  That is something that will help those carers who carry out such important work.<\/p> <p>  Finally, in relation to the CE schemes, I acknowledge the great work done right across the country.  It is not only a job activation measure.  The schemes provide some fantastic social services, and it is important that we say that.  Deputy Carey has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions.  I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly to change the age from 62 to 60 so that persons can stay on the CE scheme continuously.  If you are over 60 and on CE, you can stay on it if you choose to do so.  This is something that many members of the committee have also raised with me.  I will make significant changes to the referral process so that more people are referred from the Intreo office to CE schemes.  I will be getting reports on that because some CE schemes have been saying that they are not getting enough referrals.  I will be getting a monthly report on how many referrals are going into the CE schemes.  Most important, I will be introducing a change so that where a scheme genuinely cannot fill a vacancy after advertising it, etc., it will be allowed to keep the existing CE worker in place provided he or she is happy to stay on.  That is an important change and is something, once again, that many of the committee members have been raising with me.  There is some vital work that the schemes are doing and it is important that those services can continue.  In terms of all of that, I have to get approval from Government but I am sure I will get the support of this committee in doing so.  That is what I am hoping to do.  That will make a big difference to the CE schemes and help them carry out, as I said, not only job activation but that social aspect to the work they do that we need to recognise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#C00400","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I thank the Minister for her opening statement and for the information provided by her Department.  I have a number of questions on to the Supplementary Estimate that is before us.<\/p><p> I was surprised to see a substantial reduction in the exceptional and urgent needs payments due to lower numbers of people accessing them.  I have raised this issue with the Minister previously.  We should have better data on these payments.  There has been an obvious issue with access to community welfare officers, CWOs.  That cannot be helped in some cases because of Covid and so on, but we do not have data on the number of people applying for these payments and being refused.  All we get are data on the number who receive the payments.  We need better data on whether a payment is given is at the discretion of the CWO.  We need to know what the true demand is.  I am concerned, especially given that these are the payments being pointed to when it comes to people struggling with energy costs.  I would be surprised if &euro;19.8 million was saved due to a lower number of one-off payments.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on this.<\/p><p> I have raised the issue of community employment with the Minister several times.  I welcome her remarks about the proposals she will introduce.  Some of what she is suggesting needs to be considered in terms of the rural social scheme as well, given that there might not be someone available to replace another in rural areas.  The six-year rule causes difficulty.  I welcome the Minister's comments on examining referrals monthly.  As I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, last week, there are more than 2,500 vacancies being advertised online at the moment.  That is a large number of vacancies and points to a serious issue.  I am glad that it will be addressed and I welcome the Minister's remarks about allowing people to stay on beyond 60 years of age, reduced from 62, until they reach retirement age.  Where efforts have been made to replace a person on a scheme but no replacement can be found, he or she can now remain on the scheme if willing.  I welcome the Minister's proposals in this regard.<\/p><p> There is a figure for the amount of funding provided to the child maintenance review group.  Does the Minister expect the report by the end of the year, as was the plan?  It is important work and I hope that we see the report being published once the Minister receives it.<\/p><p> I wish to mention the blind pension.  At our meeting this time last year, I raised this matter with the Minister.  That the blind pension is means tested creates an issue where the partner, husband, wife or whatever of a blind person has a change in circumstances.  I have met people whose partners' circumstances have changed and who have as a result either got a reduced blind pension or lost it altogether even though they remain blind.  We need to examine this matter.  I am not sure what the figure is for the number of people receiving this payment, but where a person is blind for life, he or she should be entitled to it, full stop.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter.<\/p><p> Regarding a State pension for family carers and lifelong carers, the Minister mentioned after the budget that she was considering this possibility and was hoping to make progress.  Will she update us?  I presume she will engage with stakeholders like Family Carers Ireland.<\/p><p> I understand that, on budget day, a figure of approximately &euro;1.9 million was announced for the increase from &euro;100 to &euro;120 in the income threshold for the fuel allowance from January.  From a reply to a recent parliamentary question, though, the figure appears to be just under &euro;4.2 million.  Was there a change in the number of people who would receive the payment?  Last week, the Minister stated that she hoped to bring the change in ahead of January.  Will she comment on this?<\/p><p> An issue was raised with me a couple of weeks ago about a person in her 40s on a widow's pension, working full time and paying PRSI.  She got unwell with Covid, received the Covid illness payment, ended up with long Covid and had to leave work again.  She was not entitled to the illness benefit because she was in receipt of the widow's pension.  I did not realise it but it appears that widows, lone parents and deserted wives are not entitled to illness benefit where they receive the widow's pension.  Obviously, this affects women primarily.  I did not realise this was in the legislation.  I appreciate that a person on a pension typically cannot get a second social welfare payment but if widows, perhaps even young ones in their 40s who are working full time and paying PRSI, are unable to access the illness benefit should they get sick, especially where they have families, it puts a great deal of pressure on them.  Will the Minister undertake to consider this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#C00800","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions and will try to answer as many of them as I can.<\/p> <p>  Regarding exceptional and urgent needs payments, there was &euro;3.7 million of an underspend due to a lower number of one-off payments than was provided for in the Revised Estimate and this resulted in a saving of &euro;19.8 million.  We estimate allocations when putting the budget together but there were 38,000 fewer payments than we expected.  This was offset by a cost of &euro;16 million due to a higher average payment value than was provided for in the Revised Estimate due to the nature of the one-off payments and the fact that the value of claims can vary significantly over time.<\/p> <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment to meet essential one-off expenditure that a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her normal weekly income.  An urgent needs payment is a one-off payment made to persons who would not normally qualify for SWA but who would have an urgent need.  This payment is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering it, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of each case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Unlike other payments administered under the SWA scheme, the habitual residence condition does not apply to emergency needs payments or urgent needs payments.  By its nature, the housing category is the largest expenditure within the exceptional needs payment scheme, accounting for over 68% of expenditure in 2020.  This includes payments for necessary items, for example, bedding, flooring, furniture, household appliances, rent deposits and rent in advance.  As the committee knows, I have changed the criteria for women and men who were victims of domestic violence so that they do not have to be means tested for the first three months of rent supplement payments.<\/p> <p>  I will provide some figures.  In 2021, bills accounted for 1,387 payments, child-related costs accounted for 1,733, clothing accounted for 6,954, funeral expenses accounted for 2,085, general expenses accounted for 11,077, housing accounted for 21,373, illness accounted for 1,088 and urgent needs payments accounted for 259.  Some people might not have been able to get the same access to this scheme during Covid - I do not know - but the money is there and available to those who need it.<\/p> <p>  As the committee knows, I want to make some changes to community employment schemes.  I will consider the rural social scheme as well.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised it with me a number of times.<\/p> <p>  Regarding vacancies in community employment schemes, there is a shortage in the labour market because people are in employment or are not choosing to join a community employment scheme.  There are many reasons.  We want to encourage people to take up these opportunities to get experience and full-time employment.  The primary purpose of the scheme is to get people prepared for full-time employment.  I will be keeping a close eye on the figures.  There are vacancies in many areas.<\/p> <p>  The blind pension continues to be a means-tested payment.  I understand the Deputy's point.  People who qualify for this payment are blind for life, which presents them with many challenges.  Dealing with a specific issue can have other consequences, but I will examine the matter to see what we can do, if anything.<\/p><p>As for the carer's State pension, the pensions commission has recommended that people who have been caring should receive a pension.  I agree with that and want to progress the proposal as part of the report on pensions.<\/p><p> As for the fuel allowance, the threshold has been increased on the budget week change.  That is why I am looking for the extra money.  The means test has also changed such that applicants can earn &euro;120 in excess of the State pension, an increase on the previous figure of &euro;100.  That is demand-led.  We cannot just say how many people will benefit because we do not know how many people will apply.  Any figures we have put in would be based on people who had applied and did not qualify but would qualify now.  There are, however, many others out there, I am sure, who have not applied.  We would encourage people to apply for the fuel allowance and allow the calculation to be made.  Some people might qualify for it even though they may think, when they do the calculations themselves, that they do not.  They should just send in the application forms and we can have the calculations done.<\/p><p> As for the widow who applied for illness benefit, if Deputy Kerrane could give me the specific details of the case, I would be happy to follow it up and come back to her on it, if that is okay with her.<\/p><p> I think I have covered off everything she raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#D00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>I asked about the child maintenance review group.

She referred to the fact that she will continue with the cuts to the PUP and said employers are encouraged to avail of the EWSS to retain staff on their payroll, yet the scheme is being cut today.  If that cut had not taken place, how much extra would the Department have needed in the Revised Estimates?  On the basis that the Government has advised people to go out only once a week rather than possibly twice or three times and to cut back on their social contacts, does the Minister think her Department is right to make this cut?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the changes to the carer's allowance and the announcement she has made in that regard.  There is one group, however, that I have raised with her previously and wish to raise again today, which is those availing of the benefit payment for 65-year-olds.  I have heard from a woman who was working until recently, when she turned 65.  She applied for the benefit payment for 65-year-olds and the half-rate carer's allowance and was refused the latter.  Yet when she reaches 66 and avails of her State pension, she will be able to get that allowance.  That is an anomaly arising from the change made from the jobseeker's transitional payment to the payment for 65-year-olds and it should be looked at.  Very few people around the country may be affected by it - I do not know - but this woman is losing nearly &euro;150 a week now.  I ask the Minister to look into that and to change that as soon as possible in order that people such as this woman are able to avail of the half-rate carer's allowance.  They should be entitled to it when they turn 66 with a State pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#E00600","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>I will answer the question about the over-65s first.  I take the point the Deputy makes.  As she will know, the over-65s payment is a new payment and was introduced to deal with a specific problem.  As we know, people found that their contracts terminated at age 65 and they were going onto jobseekers' payments.  We changed that such that they can now apply for the benefit payment for 65-year-olds.  The payment was set up to resolve a problem we had.  I agree that we need to move forward on this in a broader sense.  I think we can do that through the pensions commission recommendations.  I take the Deputy's point, however.  I was glad that I was able to bring in a good number of changes in the budget to improve the position of carers.  As she will know, the means test for carers' payments was changed to increase the number of people eligible.  Carer's allowance is there to help people who carry out caring roles.  That is the position at the moment but, as I said, I take the point she made and will look into the matter.  It would be better, however, if we looked at this in the overall context of the pensions commission report.<\/p> <p>  As for the PUP, as the Deputy will know, businesses are open and able to trade, and many are actively recruiting.  The number on the live register is down to approximately 165,000 and the number on the PUP is down to 55,000.  There are, therefore, no signs at present that there are lay-offs happening as a result of the midnight closing time.  The number of people claiming jobseeker's payments and those claiming the PUP continue to decrease.  The EWSS Estimate is based on the decision made.  We do not have a figure to hand as to what the cost would be without that change.  The Estimate for the EWSS is provided to us by the Department of Finance.  As the Deputy will know, we set out a pathway and a plan for the PUP and now two rates are payable, a rate of &euro;203 and a rate of &euro;250.  That will continue for those receiving the PUP until the end of January or early February.  Then they will transition onto jobseeker's payments.  For some people it is actually more beneficial to be on jobseeker's at the moment because they may be able to qualify for a qualified dependant payment, that is, they may be able to claim for a partner or spouse or for qualified children.  For some, therefore, it is better that they apply for jobseeker's.  As the Deputy will know, the PUP was introduced at a time we had thousands of people out of work because of the restrictions.  That is somewhat different now.  If people are laid off, we are able to cope with the numbers that come in.  If people come to us, we can go through the full suite of social protection supports we have available and we are happy to do that with them.<\/p> <p>  I think I have answered the Deputy's questions.  I thank her for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#E00700","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>The documentation we received was very helpful.  At the macro level it seems that the Supplementary Estimate is very modest in the context of Covid continuing a lot longer than we had hoped.  It is &euro;470-odd million.<\/p><p>Then, if the amount for the bonus is taken out, which is always added at the end of the year as it is never part of the initial Estimate, I think everyone expected to be paid.  Then we go through this shilly-shallying every year where we pretend that it is not in the Estimate and we have a big announcement and we give the bonus.  If that little shimmy is taken out, could the Minister confirm that the real extra Estimate that the Department needs is in the region of &euro;100 and &euro;200 million?  In the context of a total gross expenditure of &euro;37 billion it is not a huge amount.<\/p><p> Will the Minister give a breakdown by sector of people who are still on the PUP?  In some sectors such as hospitality, it makes perfect sense that there are people still on the PUP.  Business is definitely down.  That is also the case of things such as arts.  On the other hand, I was surprised by the figure for construction.  All we hear all the time is that there are not enough construction workers to build houses, other buildings and so on.  If the Minister has more detail of that and whether there are particular sectors or of specialties in construction that have been hit, that would be very useful.  I ask her to send on the list she read out because it is interesting.  Obviously, aviation is in there somewhere but it will be broken down sectorally so there are people involved in administration will be listed under administration, and there are mechanics and those involved in maintenance.  <\/p><p> We had a budget in October but the Covid situation has not improved as people hoped.  The big questions is whether there is likely to be a knock-on effect into 2022.  Are the Estimates beginning to become a little redundant for 2022 or, in the greater scheme of things, will it be significant?<\/p><p> PUP has higher rates, but even if a person is on the PUP on the lowest rate, he or she could continue on it indefinitely.  There is no termination date.  There is a lesson that we should learn from this after the pandemic.  Most families now have two incomes.  The jobseeker's benefit period is quite constrained and when it concludes, the person is moved to jobseeker's allowance.  When that happens the spouse's income is taken into account and that can have a significant effect on family incomes and paying mortgages and so on in the real world.  In many cases it is a couple in a household earning the money.  Has the Minister reflected on the desirability, once the pandemic is over, of extending the period on which people can remain on jobseeker's benefit?  The main difference is not the rate of payment, which is the exact same, but that on jobseeker's benefit a spouse's income is not assessed.  <\/p><p> The Minister will know that I would love to see a radical review of means tests.  I will never give up on this.  It has been a mission of mine since I got into politics and there have been some minor concessions.  This country's means testing system is archaic and anachronistic.  I have a specific question.  She might have the answer but, if not, she might get it for me.  The estimated cost to the Department of the changes to means testing which she made were announced in the budget this year.  That will be in the Social Welfare Bill.  What is the estimated gross cost of those for the coming year?  It would be very instructive to us if we could get some fix on that.  I have a list of the changes that the Minister gave me in rely to a parliamentary question, which is very useful, but I would love to know how much the changes will cost.  I always believe that the radical changes we need would stimulate more activity and, therefore, would not be very expensive.<\/p><p> Finally, I am delighted with the proposed changes to CE schemes.  I hope they will happen sooner rather than later.  There are 1,977 vacant places on schemes, which is why the budget is underspent.  There are 1,033 on the T&uacute;s scheme and 107 on the rural social scheme.  The Minister said that participants would be allowed to stay on CE if there is no one to take their place.  Will that be extended to T&uacute;s?  T&uacute;s is a cheaper scheme per head for the Department.  When it was conceived, it was only intended to be a one-year scheme.  Will people be allowed to stay on the scheme where they do not get alternative employment and where there is nobody to take their place?  The excuse given all the time was that they could not stay on it because there were others there to take their place.  That is not true in some communities.  It is similar with the rural social scheme.  Will the Minister consider abolishing the six-year rule?  It was never needed from the beginning to end.  It was a very recent rule.  The scheme was working fine without it.  I never received too many complaints about people not being about to get onto RSS.  Will she abolish the six-year rule because is totally unnecessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#E00800","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>On the CE schemes, in exceptional circumstances we allow participants to stay on.  However, there is a balance.  We do not want people to be permanently on CE schemes, starting off at a young age and spending all their time on it when we would want them to try and get back into the workforce.  For older people on the CE schemes, we are looking at reducing the age from 62 to 60.  That would be a welcome change.<\/p> <p>  I will have a look at the RSS.  We intend to review it in 2022 and we can have a look at what happens there.  As the Deputy said, T&uacute;s is a one-year scheme.  We will have to put the changes to the CE in action first.  I will not start on the other schemes just yet but I keep everything under review.  <\/p> <p>   I will try and give some of the figures on the Supplementary Estimate.  It required &euro;473.5 million, not &euro;1.4 billion, because the balance of the additional expenditure will be funded from higher PRSI receipts of &euro;825 million and higher receipts of &euro;97 million from appropriations-in-aid.  The additional &euro;473.5 million would provide funding to pay the Christmas bonus of &euro;312 million and meet the 2021 costs of the fuel allowance increase.  That has gone up from October 2021 with the balance required for the net overspend on schemes and services.  It is &euro;130 million net.  <\/p> <p>  I will give some breakdown on the PUP.  There are 5,540 construction workers on PUP, which is 10% of the total.  We hear that there are a lot of vacancies in that sector so we will work with people on that.  That said, these are very broad categories.  It is very hard to get the detail we need in the different sectors.  This is very broad but those are the figures we have.  We would like to be able to work with those people in that sector because we know there are job opportunities.  If they need different skills that is why we have the apprenticeship schemes to upskill and reskill them to help them get back into the workforce.<\/p><p>I do not have anything here for aviation.  I am not sure of the figures on that.  It is not on this list we have and I cannot give the Deputy the figure.  Those are the PUP figures and we will get a copy out to him.<\/p><p> He also mentioned the jobseeker's duration.  In the programme for Government, we are committed to looking at a pay-related benefit, which will also involve an examination of the duration of the payment.  I came from a credit union and saw many times that when people were laid off work unexpectedly, they suddenly took a severe drop in their income and were very concerned about how they would meet those bills.  That is why we should consider the pay-related benefit and we can take learnings from the PUP payment, because it is linked to pay prior to Covid.<\/p><p> The cost of the means changes is the full-year cost of changes to carers, disability and fuel allowance means test of approximately &euro;30 million.  We will come back to the Deputy with a more accurate figure on that.  I think I have covered off most of his questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#F00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>Can the Minister confirm that is &euro;30 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#G00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1168,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#G00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>Is the gross expenditure is north of &euro;30 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#G00400","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#G00500","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>To put it in terms people can understand, that is like &euro;30 out of &euro;30,000.

A small number are getting caught by very cruel cuts.  Let us take the dependent adults on the contributory pension.  Presumably, in 80% or 90% of the cases in which people were caught, it was the ordinary partner who earned the money, put it in joint accounts and got caught.  If one knows the rules and all the intricacies of the system, one can avoid it quite easily, as the Minister knows, by putting it all into the earner's bank account.<\/p> <p>  However, people always advise sharing when one is in that arrangement where one works as a child rearer in the home and the other works outside of the home and that is the way the couple decide it.  That is the way it was for many people who are coming to pension age now.  The general advice would be that it is great to share everything and what is yours is mine and what is mine is yours, especially not to allow the income earner control everything and, therefore, we weaken ourselves down the road.  A huge number of people is not caught, but people are sad when they are.<\/p> <p>  It is similar to parents leaving money to kids with disabilities.

The committee has directly raised these issues with her.  There are a significant number of vacancies, up to 2,000, on the schemes.  It is important we try to get the participation rates up.  A small bit of flexibility will make a big difference there.  Overall, the Minister is now spending one in four euro of every euro allocated by Government.  A significant tranche of funding is going directly through her Department.  Some &euro;58,000 is being spent every minute by the Department, which is a substantial sum.  That leaves significant responsibility on this committee to monitor the spending of that money.<\/p> <p>  Members earlier raised questions about trying to get people back to work.  It is imperative we deal with some of the barriers forcing people to remain in low-paid employment or to remain on the live register and not take up employment.  There are issues relating to tax and PRSI, in that if people work additional hours, they are financially worse off as a result of it.  These issues have to be eradicated from the system.<\/p> <p>  Our housing income thresholds have not increased in a decade, while house prices have more than doubled in the same period.  The cut-offs are black and white.  People go &euro;1 over the income threshold and end up losing their housing support and being removed from the housing list.  That is completely unacceptable.  The objective of all our Covid supports should be about trying to keep the connection with work and keep people in work.<\/p> <p>  I am not just saying this now.  I said this in advance of the PUP coming in.  We should have resourced the EWSS more and given it priority.  The decision was made to introduce the PUP and that is the payment in place at the moment.  Seeing as we are talking on 1 December, I will focus on the EWSS, as the Minister knows the rates are being reduced from today.<\/p> <p>  She also knows first hand, as a former Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, how vital that support has been to small local businesses over the pandemic to date.  It has been a vital support to them to keep their doors open, employees on their books and it is hoped, be able to trade out of this pandemic.  They are the backbone of the economy.  In my constituency in counties Roscommon and Galway and in her constituency, they are the bulk of the driving force behind our local economies.<\/p> <p>  However, some of these sectors are being crucified.  Hospitality is one, but there are others.  The Minister is correct in that they are being allowed, under the Government restrictions, to remain open and continue to trade.<\/p><p>At the same time we have the Government openly advising people not to go into these businesses, not to trade with them, and to stay away from the businesses.  On the one hand, the doors remain open and we are not closing them, but we are issuing advice to them to minimise the engagement with those particular businesses.  What alternative supports are being put in place for those specific businesses where the Chief Medical Office and the Government are advising people to stay away from them while keeping the doors open?  It is putting a huge financial strain on those businesses.<\/p><p> Has consideration been given to including the Christmas bonus in the ordinary Estimates for the Department rather than going through this charade every year where we bring in the Christmas bonus on the run into Christmas?  It would lead to more transparent Estimates and provide reassurance to the public in the early part of the year, rather than having to wait for the bonus to come on the eve of Christmas.<\/p><p> On the Social Insurance Fund requirements, will the Minister give the committee an indication of what the Department has anticipated for the running in the near future of the fund, based on where we are with Covid-19 and the projections that she has on that?  The past 18 months have proven the volatility that can be there in the fund, especially with working age payments.  As the Minister will be aware, the pensions commission has made a recommendation that the State pension element of the Social Insurance Fund should be accounted for separately.  The Minister will know that it is far more predictable in terms of the demands it has put on the pension element of the fund, and to provide that element of transparency, and that the pension element of fund should be accounted for separately.  Are measures are being taken in the Department to implement that in the short term?<\/p><p> Finally, there is an issue that I know we will return to in the new year.  As we are dealing with the Estimates, I want to raise the issue of departmental performance targets.  Those targets are set by the management board of the Department.  We as a committee feel that we should have a role in engaging with the management board on those particular targets.  For example, instead of control measures measuring the target savings and the percentage of repayments that are made, that should be about the number of reviews that are being performed, which would negate the need to recover money in the first instance.  It should not be about recovering money; it should be about minimising the overpayments, which is far cheaper for the Department and creates far less hardship for recipients.  The target measurements for appeals and Pathways to Work had been removed from those performance measurements.  We believe that this should be reintroduced and that there should be a mechanism to measure those gaining in sustainable employment within the performance targets set by the Department.  This would negate the need for the Department to provide top-up payments such as the working family payment.  Tweaking some of the performance targets could bring about far better deliverables for the Department, and provide a greater level of transparency for the public, especially when this Department is spending in excess of &euro;1 in every &euro;4 that is being allocated by the Government.  I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2021120100002#G01800","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I get regular reports on the timelines of appeals.  The timeline has been coming down.  I will bring through provisions, as part of the Social Welfare Bill, to appoint a deputy appeals officer to assist.  In the way the legislation was set up, only one person could do this work.  I am hoping to change that.  I will bring it through with the Social Welfare Bill so that I will be able to appoint a deputy officer.  That will speed up the process also for appeals.<\/p> <p>  The Christmas bonus is not included in the Department's Estimates.  It is a discretionary decision made by the Government in the context of budget process and available resources.  The level of payment can vary annually.  It was not paid at all in the period 2009 to 2013.  It is a discretionary payment.  The decision to pay the bonus at budget time each year takes into consideration the overall fiscal position and the achievement of our overall fiscal targets.  That is the way it has been and, hopefully, we will be in a position to keep paying it.  That is the reason behind it.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the CE schemes and vacancies.  With the labour market, where there are shortages of labour it is more difficult to fill these vacancies.  We can see that the numbers on the PUP and on the live register are coming down.  That is good news because it means that more people are getting back to work.  As the Chairman has said, we need to continue to examine the barriers with regard to people remaining on the live register.  This is why we have Pathways to Work, which we launched last year.  We are completing the consultation on an early engagement roadmap for young people and for people with disabilities, and implementing this report.  There are a lot of things happening in trying to help people to get back to work, whether it is upskilling or reskilling.  We have also have the work placement programme and a number of different incentives to get people off the live register.  We continue to work hard at that.  The best way to take people out of poverty is to help them to get a job.  That is the most important thing.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the tax and PRSI.  That has been changed in the budget.  I was glad that we were able to make some changes to the tax bands.  It is important that work pays, and we want to make sure that it does so that when people go out to work they are better off doing that.  We want to make sure that they are rewarded for it.<\/p> <p>  The issue of housing income thresholds is for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The problem with bands is that if a person goes over it, then he or she has gone over it.  Where is the cut-off point?  As a Deputy, I have seen this where students may have lost out on their SUSI grant because they were &euro;4, &euro;5 or &euro;10 over the limit.  It is very frustrating, but at the same time there must be some cut-off point.  The Chairman will understand that.<\/p> <p>  On the EWSS support, the Minister for Finance has said that he will keep that under review and he will monitor it closely in the weeks ahead.  Within my Department, there is the short-term working payment were people can work three days and collect the payment for the other two days.  I am a big supporter of the wage subsidy scheme.  I believe that is the way to go.  I was in business.  I believe that the right way to do it is to try to keep that connection between the employer and the employee.  The EWSS remains open, albeit at a reduced rate.  It has been a very successful support to businesses.  Many businesses have said to me that without the EWSS their doors would have been closed.<\/p> <p>  We expect the Social Insurance Fund to return to surplus next year.  The pensions commission examined the issue of a separate fund for pensions.  I understand that the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is also examining this issue.

Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes - a limit on which I will be as strict as possible in order to allow as much time as possible for questions, debate and discussion - I wish to explain some limitations in relation to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references they make to other persons in their evidence.<\/p><p>The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, a number of witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present would do.  That is to remind witnesses they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.<\/p><p>Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are also reminded that the provisions of Standing Orders, in relation to matters which are <i>sub judice<\/i>, place an onus on them to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might, in effect, prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  Therefore, I will not permit any discussion or questioning which relates to any current litigation or investigation in the course of this meeting.<\/p><p>I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.

At its heart, the GAA is about playing matches and valuing and developing people, which means an organisation fundamentally about players and match officials.  The welfare and well-being of those groups are a high priority for the GAA, as I am sure they are for all sporting organisations.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by our national match officials manager, Mr. Donal Smyth.  Mr. Smyth oversees match officiating in all respects.  That includes referee recruitment and training and, crucially, general welfare and supports for our referees.  Mr. Smyth and I will explain the refereeing environment in the GAA.  We will be happy to hear the views of the committee, to learn from our colleagues in the other sporting organisations represented here today and, of course, to answer questions that may arise.<\/p> <p>  There are approximately 3,000 active referees and match officials in the Gaelic Athletic Association spread across football and hurling.  We should remember a few key points about the members of this group; they are essential to the playing of our games; and they carry out their duties in a high-pressure and high-profile environment and do so on a voluntary basis.  This is all the more reason that they deserve our protection, gratitude and respect.  In the GAA, we try to manifest this protection and respect in a few different spheres.  We will expand upon these as the discussion evolves today.<\/p> <p>  We equip referees to carry out their duties to the highest standard possible.  This centres around training, evaluation and feedback mechanisms for match officials.  We respond appropriately to any adverse experiences referees might encounter.  This includes providing counselling as required for our national panel on a confidential basis.<\/p><p>We bolster the authority of match officials and strive to make their job easier by operating and maintaining appropriate playing rules and a disciplinary system.  That process and its evolution is always undertaken with one eye on the practicalities for referees and it also provides for their protection in certain specific circumstances.<\/p><p> We expend a significant degree of effort on improving the culture that surrounds match officiating.  For example, the Give Respect-Get Respect initiative is an awareness campaign that seeks to ensure Gaelic games are promoted and played in a positive, fair and enjoyable manner.  That campaign engages with players, coaches, spectators and referees.  We have commissioned significant research into many of the pertinent issues being discussed here, including the mental health challenges our match officials face and their experiences of verbal and physical abuse during matches.  We have a referee development plan that details our ambitions regarding welfare provisions for match officials into the future.<\/p><p> We are acutely aware of the issues referees face.  We are aware of our responsibilities in this regard and we are working hard to improve things, but one significant challenge is the fact that not all of the determining factors are within our direct control.  There is a pervading climate among those who watch and report on games and, more significantly, those anonymous commentators on discussion forums and social media to persistently pass judgment on referees.  This is quite often unfair, with little balance and, frequently, there is very little actual knowledge of the rules of the game.  Despite our best efforts, this lack of respect can at times transfer itself to the field of play.<\/p><p> In conclusion, match officials and on-field discipline are a vital part of our and every other sporting association.  Their contribution cannot be overstated.  Put simply, if we do not have referees and officials to monitor our games, we will simply not have games.  This is a message that sometimes does not seem to hit home for many sports followers and, at times, players, irrespective of the code.  I welcome the fact that this joint committee has chosen to focus on what we consider a key issue for sport generally, and I look forward to hearing its views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan for that comprehensive statement.

It was great to see and to see so many people tune in.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the Football Association of Ireland, I thank the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for the opportunity to address this meeting on issues relating to the abuse of referees, officials and players across different sporting codes.  I am the chair of the Football Association of Ireland&rsquo;s referee&rsquo;s committee whose responsibility is the governance of all referee matters within the association.  All the referee committee members are volunteers.<\/p> <p>  As the biggest participation sport in the country, football provides so much pleasure to so many players, coaches, volunteers, officials and, of course, referees or match officials.  Our referees currently cater for more than 80 leagues across the country and in excess of 220,000 registered players.  The benefits of football to Irish society are immense and across so many areas not least the physical and mental well-being of all involved, including players and match officials.  As such, it goes without saying that in order for players to play competitive matches, we need match officials to take charge of them.  Referees are an integral part of the game, and our current social media campaign highlights no ref, no game; respect the referee.<\/p> <p>  Everyone in the FAI is well aware of the current issues around the abuse of referees, other match officials and even players and team officials.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a growing problem in Irish society and across many codes, not just football.  The recent cancellation of an entire weekend&rsquo;s programme of underage games in one league is the most recent manifestation of this problem, and it highlights the concerns of all involved with grassroots football and our united desire to combat this issue at all levels of the game before it threatens mass participation in our very game.<\/p> <p>  This issue is now coming to a head, but it is not a new one.  As recently as 2018, football&rsquo;s world governing body, FIFA, warned all national associations, including players, coaches and spectators, that the current trend of abuse towards referees would result in a global shortage of match officials.  Ireland has not escaped this scourge but we are taking steps.  Since 2019, 34 cases of physical abuse of match officials have been brought before the disciplinary control unit of the Football Association of Ireland.  As members will see from documentation forwarded to the committee, 22 of those cases resulted in long-term suspensions for those found guilty of physical abuse, ranging from 12 to 24 months.<\/p> <p>  We cannot and will not tolerate the abuse of any match official.  The onus to respect the referee in the first instance falls on the players, then the coaches, the club and supporters.  We are involved in education programmes to best inform all involved of their obligations to respect referees, and we have also engaged in a social media campaign featuring grassroots officials to highlight this with the hashtags, #NoRefNoGame and #RespectTheReferee.  As members will see from the documentation sent to them, this campaign was highlighted at the recent Ireland versus Portugal international game at the Aviva Stadium when the message was captured live on television.<\/p> <p>  We are also actively working with existing and new referees to ensure they feel safe when they cross the white line to take charge of matches.  While our referee numbers fell from 1,400 to 1,200 between 2015 and 2020, over the last 18 months we have successfully launched a recruitment drive.  At the start of 2021, while we had 1,211 registered referees, that figure has already grown to 1,430 referees today after 581 recruits to the online course, 261 of whom are already allocated to leagues and 281 awaiting Garda vetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Perry"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1200,"content":"<p>I have to stop Mr. Perry there because we have run over time.

I am the head of referees with the IRFU, a position I have held since I retired from the professional game in 2017.  In total, I have been a referee since 2001 and have officiated at all levels of the game and, while not week in, week out, I am still an active referee within Leinster.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Anne Marie Hughes, Spirit of Rugby programme manager.  The Spirit of Rugby programme was launched in September 2017 to promote and protect the values of the game.  It is primarily an education and information programme to guide the types of behaviours that the IRFU wish to be lived across our clubs.  Aimed at players, coaches, volunteers and parents, the main purpose is to educate players on their rights and responsibilities, while implementing initiatives for volunteers and administrators so they can positively influence all to engage in the game in a fair and ethical manner.  Through a series of workshops, educational material and ongoing communication, it encourages a culture within clubs where the values of the game are embedded in all activities, clearly demonstrating our values through actions.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, abuse of match officials is on the rise, and while rugby has a good reputation for respecting our officials, we are not immune and must continue to take the matter extremely seriously.  Sport is one area impacted by what seems to be an increase in abuse in society in general.  One only has to look at the many reports through social media that arise in sport week in, week out to see evidence of this.  As elected officials, I am sure members are only too aware that there are too many minority voices with extreme views.<\/p> <p>  While we have become aware of incidents of abuse at games, abuse of match officials is not something we have faced week in, week out.  Our goal, backed up by the work we do through Ms Hughes and the Spirit of Rugby programme, is to make the experience of rugby enjoyable for all involved.  This can include some appropriate encouragement towards players and referees.  In fact, most referees appreciate appropriate feedback after a game.<\/p><p>We continue to spend a lot of time and resources in education on culture and the values of the game.  The Spirit of Rugby charter, included in appendix 1, shows that all players, coaches and match officials sign up to a code of conduct, which we expect to be upheld.  When there is an example of the charter not being followed, there are processes in place in each province to address it and, if necessary, to sanction those who have been found to cross the line from what is acceptable.  Sanctioning of spectators is not so easy and is a longer journey we must travel, but we will continue to focus on ensuring those on the terrace understand our culture and respect the match-day experience for all.  We have provided education resources to clubs and schools throughout the country to remind those attending games that players, referees and coaches are volunteers and take part for fun.  Examples of this material are included as appendix 2.<\/p><p> In cases where abuse has been experienced, we believe it is vital match officials who have been impacted are supported by their province and, ultimately, the IRFU.  Refereeing is a rewarding and enjoyable role in sport, but it will come as no surprise to members that it can also be a lonely job at times.  We urge rugby clubs to include their referees in activities such as training and social events to counter any feelings of isolation, which in turn can add to the difficulties experienced on a bad day.<\/p><p> On the professional side of the game-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dudley Phillips","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr. Phillips but he has run over time.

There has been much media attention recently regarding the continued nationwide verbal abuse of referees and threats of violence towards them in a number of sporting codes.  My own reference point is the Irish Soccer Referees Society, which comprises almost 1,000 members nationwide in our 27 branches, with members in every county.<\/p> <p>  Thousands of matches take place every week, providing a vital recreational outlet for many thousands of players, parents and spectators.  In some of the more socially deprived areas, this is sometimes the main outlet for young people, and our members gladly play their part.  The downside is when banter is replaced by insulting, foul language, sometimes followed by threats of violence directed at the referee.  In 99% of games, referees are on their own at the venues; it is only at the top level of schoolboy or girl and amateur football that assistant referees will be present.  The effects of this type of behaviour can be very demoralising for the referee, and when this becomes a regular event, many of them decide enough is enough, say to themselves they do not need this in their lives and retire from the game.  Even worse is when assaults occur.  In Dublin, there have been three in the past three months.  In these instances, the players were suspended for 12 months, the minimum suspension allowed for under FAI rules.<\/p> <p>  The question being asked today is what the State can do to improve the situation.  We have always recommended to our members that if they are assaulted, they should report the matter to the Garda, but in most cases this does not happen, possibly due to the fear of recrimination.  Another factor we have noticed over the years is that when cases are reported to the Garda, the judicial process seems to take a long time.  Perhaps the State could help by encouraging a more urgent response from our lawmakers when such threats or assaults are reported.  This, in turn, could lead to our members having more confidence reporting such incidents.  If this happened, the people involved in this behaviour might see there are real consequences to their actions.<\/p> <p>  We are open to any suggestions that may arise from this meeting and look forward to any further engagement that may follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Slattery"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1205,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Slattery, in particular for sticking to the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#C00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>Like our guests, I acknowledge the role of referees.  They do a really important job, as pointed out by everyone throughout this discussion.  Along with most people, I would not do it, which is probably why it is such a struggle to get referees.  I often think referees and goalkeepers have the two worst jobs on the pitch.  Theirs are both thankless jobs.  Like that of goalkeepers, the job of referees is really important.  I welcome the presentations and thought they were great, although I would have liked an organisation that represents a smaller sport to have been included.  I mean no disrespect to the big three sports that are represented here but I think it would have been helpful to have included an organisations that represents a smaller sport.  Generally, when we discuss sport, we focus on the big three sports - the expert group on Covid, for example, deals with the big three &ndash; but we should be more inclusive of the smaller sports.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Slattery stated three referees have been assaulted in recent months.  I recall many years ago seeing a player violently assault a referee in Marlay Park, and to this day I still find it shocking to picture that.  It was shocking then and remains so.  A 12-month suspension is not enough.  If someone assaults a referee in a game, there should be a lifetime ban from that sport.  It is completely unacceptable, as our guests highlighted, because it is not just an assault of the referee but it also puts everyone off participating in that sport.  As I said, the incident I witnessed had a strong impact on me.  A ban of a year or two years is not enough when a referee is assaulted.  I would like to hear our guests' views on introducing lifetime bans in all sports and particularly in the case of soccer.  <\/p> <p>  There is a culture in soccer of abusing referees.  I have participated in that sport all my life, and while I love all sports, I love soccer in particular.  I have seen referees being abused at matches I have both attended and participated in.  When a referee is abused in soccer or any sport, it is not just the individual who should be sanctioned.  We need to ensure the club that player plays for or supports is sanctioned too.  There is a culture, in both soccer and GAA, in my experience, whereby it is somehow considered acceptable to abuse referees, but clearly it is not.  That culture has to be wiped out and that can be done only by sanctioning not only the player but also the club itself.  Without real enforcement of sanctions, the problem will just continue and incidents will persist.  Having participated in soccer, I have seen the abuse of referees and it is horrendous.  I have seen referees walk away from matches.  The club, too, has to face a sanction where a referee is abused.  There have to be stronger sanctions for clubs, as well as for individuals.  If there is an assault, the book has to be thrown at the perpetrator.  We have to tackle that culture.  The FAI has initiated a promotional campaign with David Gallagher of no ref, no game, as mentioned.  Is there a way of getting that to the various clubs and promoting it at a club level?<\/p><p>Maybe that is being done but I have not seen it.  The IRFU mentioned that it provides counselling.  Do referees have access to counselling from the FAI where they have faced that sort of abuse or are struggling and need that support?<\/p><p> Women refereeing matches has started and I have seen it at matches and on television.  It is important that a recruitment drive goes on among the different sports to increase the participation of women in refereeing because there is no reason they should not do so.

Lots of things happen at different levels of the game and something can happen in the same game that is handled or managed differently at different times in the game.<\/p> <p>  On punishments, about two and a half years ago we changed the rule to change the level of punishment.  The minimum punishment for a straightforward offence was 12 months and for more complex offences it was three years.  Those are minimums and they can go up extensively.  In one of the most recent cases there was a 40-year ban.  I think there is a legal issue with giving lifetime bans.  I understand that if someone is banned for a lifetime that has an implication in law.  That is one of the reasons we do not support lifetime bans.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about clubs being punished.  The FAI regulations provide an opportunity to fine clubs and the association has recently reformed a welfare group for referees, which is addressing the area the Deputy has touched on in punishing clubs more severely.

I will start with the FAI and then I will move to the other organisations.  This morning my local paper, the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>, carried an opinion piece on this subject and the headline in Jimmy Geoghegan&rsquo;s piece was &quot;Time to give all bully boys the red card&quot;.  I will jump to his summation where he talks about how the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>carried a story in early October on how the Louth branch of the Irish Soccer Referees&rsquo; Society, ISRS, had issued a statement referring to the difficulties encountered by its members, officially in games in the north-eastern football league.  It adopted a zero tolerance stance whereby if they had abuse directed towards them they would simply pick up the ball and walk off the field.  They said that on certain days they knew there would be serial offenders playing.  The officials also clearly felt that not enough was being done by those who govern the game to stamp out the abuse.  A spokesperson for the Louth branch said, &quot;The lack of appropriate sanctions is allowing such serial offenders to continue to attend and operate in an official capacity.&quot;  One of the things they asked for was clearly marked areas for coaches and officials and that supporters would be at least 2 m back from the pitch behind a rope, fence or marked line of a different colour.  Is that being taken on board by the FAI to protect its officials?  Will those clear lines of demarcation be brought in?  I remember some years back from my time as a sports reporter being at a derby game in the Meath and district league round and a supporter beside me headbutted one of the players over an incident.  That happened because there were no demarcation lines.

A number of leagues already apply a rope around the football pitches in public spaces but it is difficult for a referee to police that and it is up to the clubs to police it.  What happens is that after a period of time the rope gets pushed forward and then all of a sudden it is on the ground.  It is difficult and it is much easier to deal with that behaviour where there is an actual fence on a private ground.

He said there are worldwide difficulties with the retention of referees across many codes and sports, including small sports like athletics.  Retention is one of the primary areas for us to address.  Within refereeing circles we provide continuing professional development and the ISRS provides welfare and education, which are key.

The most common word used today has been \"volunteers\".  Without volunteers in all organisations we would have no sport.  If we had no sport, there would be an awful lot of depressed people out there.  I am a sportsperson and enjoy playing sport.  I played soccer, Gaelic, rugby, athletics and tiddlywinks and did everything involved in sport.  I have nothing but admiration for sport and think sport is fantastic for the health and well-being of anyone participating in or watching it.<\/p> <p>  One criticism I will make is that social media and sports pundits have a lot to say.  I am disappointed that these ex-sports stars and ex-referees go on social media, radio, Facebook and everything else to criticise fellow players and referees and do not realise that these people are human beings.  Over the last number of years, a large number of people have had depression, suicidal thoughts and everything else.  This is something these people should not get away with.  As a player, manager and currently county board chairman, one thing I have learned in sport is not to criticise your own.  If you have nothing nice to say, do not say anything.  That is something all organisations should look at.<\/p> <p>  We are here today basically to talk about referees.  The biggest problem we have is when a referee makes a decision, puts it in his report and it goes to the committees and hearings.  All of a sudden, it is an in thing that all clubs do whatever they can to get a decision overturned.  That can even mean getting solicitors or barristers involved.  All they are doing is belittling the decisions the referee makes.  County board and associations are doing their best to help referees but this is about making the referees look stupid at all costs when he or she makes a mistake.  I notice from my involvement in sport that this is becoming very common.  We all have to put our hands up and to protect referees.<\/p> <p>  With ex-players and referees coming out with mental health issues, what is each organisation doing to help facilitate volunteers who have given up loads of their time to help the organisation, mostly free of charge?  I will start with Mr. Ryan and Mr. Smyth in the GAA.  I am the chairman of the Louth county board.  I am a GAA person and have known Mr. Ryan and Mr. Smyth for a number of years.  I have great respect for all the organisations, especially the GAA.  The number of young people participating in the sport is fantastic.<\/p><p>The logo the referees have on their jerseys states, Give respect, Get respect.  To me, it is a sign that before the whistle is blown, people can see the referees are there to do a job and that all they are looking for is respect.  If you give them respect, they will give you respect back.  It is a fantastic achievement that there are 3,000 active referees at the moment.<\/p><p> I agree with Senator Cassells.  This year, I was involved with the Louth GAA.  We got an extra 11 referees this year.  That is a great boost because we play a lot of football.  We need maybe 30 or 40, if not 50, referees every weekend to facilitate the games.  As the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, stated, if you have no referees, you have no games.  When I sat down to talk to those 11 referees, I asked them what their major problems were this year.  They said the biggest problem they had this year was not on the field, but off the field.  As Mr. Ryan and Mr. Smyth know, most GAA pitches in the country have a perimeter wall around them.  The problem is the parents and the abuse they give to the referees.  This is from the under eights and under tens, the Blitz or whatever it is.  This abuse is creeping into all games.  We will have to look at it going forward.  Ms Hughes runs the Spirit of Rugby programme, which is educating the spectators and the families.<\/p><p> Do the organisations meet on a regular basis?  Do they talk about the problems they have?  They are the three biggest organisations.  This year, my son, Stephen, retired from football but he wanted to stay involved in the game.  He became a referee, which was great.  It means he can participate in the game and carry on.  The common issue for all the organisations is the turnover of referees.  The FAI said that 66% of new referees withdraw their services after two years.  To me, that is a high figure.  That should not be happening.  Mr. Phillips said earlier, and I agree with him, that as a sportsperson looking in, rugby seems to be the sport that gets the most respect.  I do not know whether that is both on the field and off the field.  I go to many rugby matches.<\/p><p> If the three organisations sat down and talked to each other, I am sure they would find many common goals.  It is important to protect the referees.  They are human beings.  What protections are the three organisations giving to referees?  When a referee gets abuse, a decision is made by the relevant organisation&rsquo;s committee.  Next, it will go to hearings, to the DRA or whatever.  It is important we let the referees know we are totally behind them.  As Mr. Smyth said, all of these referees are well trained and fit.  There seems to be serious knock-down in all of the organisations.  It is important that we protect the referees.  We need the referees.  Without the referees, we would have no games of football.  What are the organisations doing to recruit more referees?  What protections are they giving the referees?  If a referee gets into trouble, either mentally or physically, what back-up plan do the organisations have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#E01900","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1239,"content":"<p>I remind our guests that we have three minutes for replies, so I will ask them to as brief as possible.

There has been a historical issue around the referee getting information about the outcome of any case that was taken against the player.  Since we have centralised that process, that has changed dramatically.  In the last two years, that information around the results of cases of assault goes directly to the referee.  It is copied to the referees committee and to the Irish Soccer Referees Society.  Around the protection of referees, both the society and the association run ongoing continuing professional development, CPD, programmes.  It is a requirement for all referees at every level to complete at least three programmes.  We focus on many areas that are associated with abuse.  The programmes are primarily around match control and around player management.  The laws of the game also allow referees to address coach behaviour.  There was a recent change in the law whereby if somebody associated with the technical staff cannot be identified, the referee can issue a caution or an expulsion to the head coach.

We cannot do that in refereeing because of Covid-19 and bringing everyone to one place.

My notes are a bit scattered here, but I want to pick up on the under-reporting side of this.  Do the organisations' representatives think there is under-reporting both internally, within the associations, as well as to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  There is no need to reinvent the wheel.  We see under-reporting of racism to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we see under-reporting of homophobia.  I was looking at a document and some of the questions that arose were: &ldquo;Isn't it just something that I have to just put up with?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Would I be wasting police time?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Would everyone find out about me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is the point in reporting?&rdquo;.  These are all questions I am sure any referee would ask themselves because it has become so acceptable on the pitch, on the terraces, or on the sidelines to hear this kind of abuse.<\/p> <p>  Is there under-reporting both internally and to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Would the organisations support referees, and Mr. Phillips touched on this in his last comment, if they want to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Do they inform referees about their rights or the appropriate State agencies?  For example, the Immigrant Council of Ireland has a trusted service for reporting racism, if someone might not want to go to the garda&iacute;, or whatever.<\/p><p>There are templates there.  I commend the FAI.  I was at the cup final in the Aviva stadium in Lansdowne Road, and I saw the \"No ref, No game\" campaign advertised.  I acknowledge that.  Deputy Andrews asked if we would see it in League of Ireland grounds as well.<\/p><p> The IRFU called on clubs to include referees in social events.  The witnesses should please excuse my ignorance, but I do not know if a referee is associated with a club.  I assume not.  How would such inclusion happen?<\/p><p> It was mentioned at the outset that politicians know all too well about online abuse, but perhaps less so in person.  It is horrific to think that young women and men are literally petrified on a pitch and have to put up with the kind of abuse we get day in, day out online.  It is shocking.  From my experience of playing, while there are issues concerning abuse, because we are more conscious of the abuse, in some cases it is increasing the amount of respect towards referees and an extra effort is put in by some people on the pitch to thank and acknowledge the referee.<\/p><p> Is the FAI hampered in how it might deal with this culture by FIFA or UEFA?  Is the FAI limited in what it can do because of a lack of willingness on the part of FIFA or UEFA to prioritise this?  The question could also be asked of the IRFU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#F01000","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>I wish to refer back to two points that were made.  One of the first points is that referees might ask what is the point.  That would be a big worry for me across all sports if a referee were to have that view.  It is our job to make sure that referees feel the support of whatever code they are involved in, that they will be supported and that there is a proper structure and procedure in place to follow through and rectify any wrongs that may have taken place.  That is the first point I would make and encourage us to do.<\/p> <p>  I was asked another question about involvement in clubs.  An integral part of retention, which is a word that was used earlier, is to feel part of a club.  At the end of the day, we are club members.  That could be either be through training and affiliation with an individual team or teams or social events.  Ultimately, it could also help create a familiarity and bond between players, coaches and referees as we go through the journey of a match official.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dudley Phillips"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Warfield for his comments.  Regarding the under-reporting of assaults to the Garda, this is where the State could throw its weight behind the process.  I have personal experience of it.  It could be seven or eight months from the initial report before hearing from the Garda again.  We hear the case is with the solicitors, for example.  A tiny percentage of assaults in soccer are reported to the Garda.  I will not mention any names, but there was a high profile case a few years ago.  That takes media attention from the other assaults.  Everyone thought a big lesson would be learned, but in the following year there were 21 assaults.  It would be a fantastic help if the judicial process could be speeded up so that it might not take a year and a half before an assault case goes to court.  Supports could be put in place.<\/p> <p>  I highlighted to members of the committee that the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act was used in one case with which I was involved.  The threat of an assault is enough to get a conviction, apart from any FAI rules or suspensions.  A clear message could be sent out that there are consequences, other than just being banned for a month from a football game.  That would be a great benefit to the members, and it might lead to an uptake.  We always encourage members to report assaults to the Garda.<\/p> <p>  We also had an incident two weeks ago where a referee was told he would be killed by somebody when he was getting into his car.  That has been reported to the Garda.  There is stuff that goes on and suspensions are handed out by the FAI.  The FAI has regulations in place.  It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel.  What happened is that some of the disciplinary bodies in the leagues around the country are not using the sanctions that are available to them, which could send a strong message.  The FAI and the society have worked very hard to get the regulations in place.  There have been small fines and the same people are being reported.  There are options for multiple sanctions.  We do not need a brand new list of rules to come in but, from a legal point of view, it would be great if members knew that it would not take forever to get something addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Slattery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1251,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Warfield.

There was a question on whether we are hampered by FIFA and UEFA in terms of the culture.  In fact, the contrary is the case.  As recently as last week, UEFA wanted to know about the issues involved in referee recruitment and how it could assist with that.  As I said in the opening statement, FIFA is very keen to say that everybody has a responsibility in this regard in football.

I will restrict my comments to the sphere of verbal abuse, because that is the more prevalent worry we have in the GAA.  That could be due to a combination of factors.  As individuals, people can have different levels of tolerance for different situations.  That is not a good thing.  People can perhaps have reservations about how issues are going to be dealt with.  We have a responsibility to reassure referees that not only is it their responsibility to report but it is our responsibility to act on it when they do.

What was highlighted in the opening statements is incredibly stark and worrying.  This is an issue that we definitely have brushed under the carpet and, maybe, had a blas&eacute; attitude to as something that is part of sport and that we need to get on with it and over it.  It has to be remembered that these are individuals and they have lives and feelings too.  I am glad  we are having this session and, hopefully, highlighting this and making people think twice about it.<\/p><p> We have all seen this happening.  Anybody who has attended a sports game from local to international club level will have heard the shocking and abusive language levelled in the main at referees.  We have also witnessed the intimidation, with families being brought into much of the abuse that is being levelled.  Management are not free from this abuse either.  Where a wrong substitution is made, a certain section of the crowd will respond and call the person responsible for it everything under the sun.  It is not good enough and we need to clean this up, not just for referees but for players and management as well.  I respect that this discussion is mainly about referees.  I have seen some of the disgusting hand gestures being made towards referees, the name calling and the physical intimidation after a game where referees sometimes have to run a gauntlet of really angry disrespectful individuals.  We have all seen this.  It has been part of the furniture for so long, we have turned a blind eye to it.  We cannot do that anymore.  In that regard, this engagement is really important.  <\/p><p> I have two questions, on which, with the permission of the Chair, I would like to engage in a questions and answers session.

During the championships last year where there were a couple of big decisions that went against particular teams the referees were subjected to awful abuse.  Ireland is a such a small country that an envelope with only Donal Smyth, Navan, on it can get to me.  That is what is happening around the country.  The top referees are so well known these types of letters are getting to them.  I get them at Croke Park as well, which I deal with specifically.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the online abuse.  A referee makes a decision in a split second on a particular day, which he believes is right.  There is no understanding of how or why the referee makes a decision.  On two occasions last year, two of our top referees were subjected to awful abuse.  As rightly said by Mr. Slattery, we are lucky that we have such comradery of the panels in supporting each other, as well as the other supports.  As said earlier by Mr. Ryan, in ordinary club games, in some cases, referees do not report the incidents.  That is where the issues arise.  We are trying to provide support and to encourage referees to report abuse, but as said in earlier responses it is insidious.  When top referees are being subjected to it, what is happening at local level worries me.  <\/p> <p>  I want to return to a point made earlier by Mr. Phillips.  The most important thing is the support structure.  As every referee in the GAA is a member of a club, the club should be putting the arm around the referee in that circumstance as well and also be providing support.  We are a community.

We might not agree with them at all times, but they deserve the utmost respect when carrying out their duties.

It is not a question of relativity or comparisons with other organisations.  To the extent there is an issue in the GAA, it is the GAA's problem to solve.  Sadly, we are not immune from many of the issues we are discussing today.  With regard to the process involved in referees reporting and collating information, if there is a disciplinary issue in a referee's report, he is required to submit that report within 24 hours.  At national level, that is done electronically.  We have good and fairly robust numbers, electronically, because of a new IT system we have rolled out in the past 18 months or so.  That has not yet extended to county level, which is still largely paper based.  Reports of local instances of abuse are dealt with by the competition control committees, CCCs, at county level.<\/p> <p>  In terms of robust statistics, overall, the national statistics are probably more relevant for me to quote and I hope, give a decent indication of scale.  Over the course of the past year, we have had towards 1,000 intercounty games.  Some 104 players were sent off during those games and three of those were sent off for abuse and those instances resulted in suspensions.  In addition, there was one case involving a team official.<\/p> <p>  I have to admit that speaks to me of under-reporting, for whatever reason, whether it is cultural, or to do with tolerance of individuals or trust in ourselves in terms of how we prosecute them.  I cannot point to anything empirical to suggest what the level should have been, but we would all accept there were probably more than three instances of abuse at intercounty GAA matches over the course of the past year.  In terms of going forward and the collation of information, the intention is that we continue the roll out of the new Foireann system, which will happen post-Covid.

If the sanctions arrived at, at the end of the process are to be robust and stood over, it is important all of those little protocols are built into the system.  What we have, more than a lax disciplinary system, is a disappointing culture of lack of respect for officials.

Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned women in sport.  Maggie Farrelly was mentioned as having made history.  I would also mention Michelle O'Neill from Wexford.  She became the first Irish referee to officiate at the Olympic Games, which was great.  As we are approaching the end of the meeting, most questions have been asked.  The representative of the Irish Soccer Referees Society said in his statement that the problem is nationwide.  He also said that the FAI rule book sets out certain rules but are they are greatly enforced?  What is the case?<\/p> <p>  A representative of the GAA mentioned a survey was being done by Dr. Noel Brick, a lecturer in sports psychology.  Is that available to the public and to the committee?  I would say its findings would be very interesting.  <\/p> <p>  What do the witnesses consider to be the biggest obstacle for referees?  I played all sports and I coached the three sports represented here.  I have some experience of it.  I ended my sporting career in rugby.  I passed on much of the information I got from rugby because it was disciplined.  There were very few incidents.  In the other sports there were some, especially with respect to players.  We must concentrate on having a player-driven and particularly a coach-driven approach to tackling this problem.  I have found there are good coaches and bad coaches and often when there is a bad coach there is indiscipline and that spreads throughout the club and on to the field.  It is important coaches are really aware of what they are coaching.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Respect campaign, we also had a great campaign against racism.  Racism must be addressed in sport.  Do the witnesses consider a campaign involving high profile spokespeople could help in championing respect towards officials?  Should such a campaign be introduced?  Many high profile panellists are inclined to take apart referees when they make a mistake.  We have high profile games where the referee has a video assistant referee, which is very good.  We should welcome the technology and we have Hawk-Eye and so forth.  Ordinary referees do not have benefit of that technology.  They have to make a split second decision at a moment in time.  They make it, whether it be right or wrong, and it has to be dealt with.  I advised all the teams I coached that the referee is the 16th player on the field.  The referee can play with the team or against it and it is up to members of the team to be disciplined.  That point should also be put forward.<\/p> <p>  It was also stated that great knowledge could be shared from all three organisations getting together.  Even if players from the different disciplines met once or twice a year and discussed situations in each discipline, that would be very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#K00500","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>Do any of the witnesses want to respond to Deputy's comments and observations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#K00600","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1283,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's question on the rules not being enforced, those are FAI regulations.  Some members might not be aware that every league in the country has a disciplinary committee.  They are mostly run by hard-working people who are also volunteers.  A new system was brought in a few years ago and Mr. Perry would have been on top of that when it was introduced.  Any assaults are now reported.  The referee sends in a match report of the assault to the league.  Immediately, all assaults nationwide go to a disciplinary control unit, which is run by the FAI.  It has its own panel, including legal experts.  Assaults have not been dealt with at local level since 2019.  They all go to the disciplinary control unit, which has very strong powers.  It recently handed down a few suspensions for 12 months, which is the minimum.  The problem with the persistent verbal abuse and misconduct, sometimes by coaches, etc. - the same people engage in it all the time - is that it is dealt with at the discretion of the local league disciplinary committees.  The problem seems to be, and it surfaced a few weeks ago, that the same names keep getting reported for misconduct and either small fines or small suspensions were given out whereas under the FAI&rsquo;s regulations there is a much wider span.  It is nearly open-ended for the handing down of lengthy bans, etc.  There is a sense that many of the leagues do not the enforce the existing sanctions.  It is not that new sanctions are needed but there needs to be enforcement of the existing sanctions.

I find particularly with under-age players that the parents can get emotional when their young sons or daughters are playing.  They really get into the game and sometimes what they say on the sidelines is not nice.  Often parents try to live their lives through their children.

It is only when people on the touchlines and sidelines, particularly parents, are shown their behaviour played back to them or examples of how they behaved that they realise how poor their behaviour was.<\/p> <p>  Some 33% of our clubs are currently engaged with our clubmark accreditation programme and under our next strategy we want 100% of the clubs to be engaged in the programme.<\/p><p>As part of achieving accreditation on an annual basis each club would need to work with its coaches to have a parent education workshop delivered to every parent in the club.

It is tough for us to deal with online abuse so any legislation or mechanism for reporting and handling online abuse would be fully welcomed.<\/p> <p>  Negative behaviours, such as incidents of racism, will not be tolerated and are unacceptable.  They are learned behaviours.  As part of our new strategy we are considering how we can get into the education space and look at how we can help teachers with resources.  All sports, in particular the senior international football team that recently enjoyed some success on the pitch, are very diverse, which reflects Irish society.  Children view players as superstars.  Therefore, we have an opportunity to use the profile of our superstars to help teachers in the education sector to, hopefully, use sport and these superstars as a way to educate people on what is acceptable behaviour.

The high profile GAA stars and players are amateur players and the Monday after a weekend match they must attend college, work or wherever.  Much of our discussion today has been, and rightly so, centred on the protection of referees but the same principles and rights extend to anybody irrespective of their role, whether it is playing or officiating a game.<\/p> <p>  What we would like to see is some understandable and easily communicable charter that sets out the rights and expectations of individuals when they feel they have been subjected to abuse.

There may well need to be something around that and I am not sure what the answer is.  If a threshold is set then it would be fair to expect that when somebody who feels that threshold has been breached, with regard to themselves, they have some clear path or recourse, and are able to understand what course of action they can take and what are the responsibilities the social media firm involved.

I will take his second question first.  It is a very difficult one to answer from our point of view.  Games within the FAI and 80 leagues are played six days of the week now that we have floodlit pitches at grassroots level.  Our referees are out referring six days a week and many games are played.  When games fall through, it can be due to a clash of fixtures.  If referees are all only available at the weekend, that is when our biggest problem will arise.  If we look at the number of referees per league, it varies significantly.  It is very difficult for us to capture an exact figure of the number of games lost because it depends on whether a referee is available for only one day or one afternoon, whether he or she is available multiple times a week or whether there is a clash of fixtures.<\/p><p>That is a difficult question to answer.<br\/><br\/>On the counselling piece, we have a medical director in the association.  If needs be, we can refer cases up for consultation.  We do not have formal counselling, but we are available to guide and assist referees who feel that is a requirement that they might need.  Senator Carrigy may not have been here when I made the comment about having a pyramid approach to dealing with abuse and the <i>sequelae <\/i>of abuse.  In the first instance, we look at the support mechanisms locally, whether it is from the Irish Soccer Referees Society, referees&rsquo; observers or friends and colleagues.  If their needs are greater than that, then we would escalate it to more professional services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021120100002#M01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Perry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>The number of referees has been impacted by Covid-19.

In March 2016, I became the chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, a government trading fund delivering services to over 40 million customers.  I retired from that role in December of last year.<\/p> <p>  I have also been fortunate to have a parallel non-executive career.  I floated the waste management company, Biffa plc, where I chaired the board HSE committee and I set up the UK&rsquo;s Renewable Fuels Agency where I chaired the audit and risk committee.  I am currently a non-executive director and chair of the remuneration and nominations committee at Harwich Haven Authority, where we provide the pilots for the world&rsquo;s largest container ships arriving at the Port of Felixstowe.  I fulfil the same role at Sage Housing, a private equity-backed provider of high-quality, affordable and social housing in England.  For the past 16 years, I have been a fellow at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, providing training for businesses on issues such as net zero carbon, human rights and commercialising sustainable development.<\/p> <p>  My infrastructure experience has been reasonably extensive, ranging from overhead power lines in the UK, undersea power cables in Australia, a new port in Brazil, rail infrastructure in the UK to deepening the channel in the North Sea to accommodate future growth in container ships.<\/p> <p>  With regard to corporate governance, my experience ranges from establishing a new government agency, chairing board committees in both the private and the private equity sectors, chairing a government trading fund until I appointed an independent chair and as a member of governance committees for two global listed companies.  I hope my experience on safety, standards and sustainability will be of benefit to TII as takes its next step on its journey.<\/p> <p>  I was told previous to the meeting that the committee is interested in hearing my views on the strategic priorities while in the role.  I need to preface any views I may offer by informing the committee I was appointed nine days ago.  As such, I am very early on in my assessment of the expectations placed on TII and the overall governance arrangements needed to ensure TII is successful.  Therefore, please take the following statements as my very early views.<\/p><p>The first area is the national development plan, NDP.  As this committee knows better than anybody, the NDP was published in October 2021 and sets out the development activities for national roads and public transport projects that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, will address between 2021 and 2030.  It should be recognised that, of course, TII is first and foremost a delivery organisation working in collaboration with local authorities while taking its lead from both the Department of Transport on national roads and national greenways, and the National Transport Authority, NTA, in regard to both the Luas and MetroLink. <\/p><p> In an ideal world, funding would be made available to support all projects irrespective of their stage of development.  However, TII must operate within the funding made available and will take its lead from the Department of Transport and the NTA in determining where investment should be best made to achieve value for money and to deliver more sustainable transport infrastructure and services. <\/p><p> Against this backdrop, however, maintaining the assets we already have across the road and Luas rail network is essential for the safety of users, maintaining the value of those assets and ensuring continuity of service delivery.  TII&rsquo;s knowledge of the condition of assets, being proactive in their maintenance and, where needed, renewal, will reduce the risk as well as the inconvenience to the travelling public and the risk of significant additional investment associated with asset failure; that is the one thing one needs to avoid.  Maintaining existing assets is both common sense and good value.  Unfortunately, it does not result in too many photo opportunities, which is some of the downside.  <\/p><p> When it comes to new infrastructure, whether it be a new road or light rail, such as MetroLink, for example, I am very conscious that external factors can often result in delays adding cost to the project and leaving the public waiting longer than expected before they see improvements in travel.  TII has a proven history of delivering projects and the skills and capability to deliver the new infrastructure.  It will need to work closely with stakeholders to ensure any potential delays at all stages in the process are minimised.  <\/p><p> The second area is the carbon action plan.  The conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, recently reinforced at COP26, serve to highlight the importance of a transition to net zero carbon by 2050 if we are to keep global temperature increases to below 1.5&deg;C.  In keeping with the EU&rsquo;s Fit for 55, the Government has set a target for a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  Road transport is, at present, responsible for around 18% of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  In playing its role in reducing this impact, TII will work closely with the Department of Transport and others. <\/p><p> For example, modal shift from personal vehicles to public transport and active travel, demand management interventions and changes to infrastructure design.  Accommodating growth in electric, hybrid and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles require policy interventions, investment in infrastructure and new services.  All represent a sizeable challenge and TII will need to assess how its obligations in the NDP can deliver the required change.  With its highly professional and capable workforce, TII will play an important role in facilitating the change and delivering the carbon reduction targets.  <\/p><p> The third area is road safety strategy.  As the committee knows, TII has a duty to deliver a safe and efficient national road network and a strategic goal to improve the safety of light rail.  The safety of transport users, of our colleagues and of our contractors and partners is of paramount importance.  Everyone has a right to get home safe at the end of every day.  That is very simple.  In addition to its maintenance, renewal and enhancement of infrastructure and its management of the road and light rail network, TII will deliver projects and programmes to support the soon to be published road safety strategy. <\/p><p> As we seek to encourage active travel, embedding the safe systems approach into TII&rsquo;s design standards and guidance documents will be important for enhancing safety for vulnerable road users. <\/p><p>One safety enhancement currently being implemented is the dynamic traffic management system on the M50.  I understand that the Chair and members of this committee visited the motor operations control centre to gain an understanding of the project to inform its scrutiny of the legislation that will make the variable speed limits and lane closures enforceable.  I hope members found that visit useful and, of course, members are more than welcome to visit again should they need to. <\/p><p> From a finance perspective, in the annual report in 2020, TII acknowledged the support from both the outgoing Minister and the current Minister, Deputy Ryan, given the impact Covid-19 had on income, particularly in relation to tolling and light rail operations.  With the reintroduction of some restrictions, income is again likely to be affected during 2021 and into 2022.  TII will continue to ensure its activities are delivered as efficiently as it can, thereby keeping any further recourse to public funds to a minimum.  <\/p><p> The precise timing of expenditure for multi-year capital programmes can be uncertain.  Projects can be subject to delays in the planning process as well as unexpected factors which arise during construction.  TII will continue to engage with stakeholders to reduce any such delays and will continually improve programme planning to optimise the allocation of resources. <\/p><p> I will turn to my final area which is around governance for success.  As I mentioned to the board when they met on 23 November, my primary goal as chair is to ensure TII is successful in delivering its statutory responsibilities and its obligations under the NDP.  In this regard, I see the board as having three critical roles: to ensure the organisation&rsquo;s strategy aligns with TII&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities and Government priorities and is deliverable within the funding envelope; to ensure the executive benefit from access to the counsel, guidance and advice of the talented non-executive directors on the TII board; and to ensure TII efficiently delivers infrastructure and services which stand the test of time, contribute to reducing carbon and keep the travelling public safe whether they travel by light rail or road.  <\/p><p> Through discussions prior to my appointment, I have the sense that existing governance arrangement and capability of colleagues at TII are both held in high regard.  That said, of course, the future always involves an element of change, and ensuring the governance model is set up for success will be a key focus for me. <\/p><p> I thank the committee for its time and I am, of course, very happy to answer any questions as best I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Llewellyn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1350,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Llewellyn.

I have been asked the question that the Senator just asked numerous times over the last couple of weeks.  I will give him the same answer I have been giving, that there are three reasons.  One reason is the commonality of purpose.  Having a sustainable transport network has such an impact on all of the priorities within the NDP.  It improves access for people to get education, healthcare, access to public services and for employment reasons.  If it is delivered sustainably, it has a better impact on the environment and it has a huge impact on the economy.  My view of sustainable transport aligns with where TII is heading, which is important to me.  The second reason is that there is enough challenge here.  I have always worked in businesses where, in many cases, the organisation has been in distress.  That is not the case with TII, but there is a challenge here with MetroLink and some of the investments that we have coming.  There is a sufficient challenge for me to feel as though it is a good organisation to join.  The third bit is if I can add value, and if I cannot, then the Senator is probably talking to the wrong person.  However, from the experience I have had working around the world with some very big companies, but also working in the public sector, I can add some value to both the board and in mentoring the executive as well.  With those things in mind, I looked at TII and thought that it was something worth applying for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Llewellyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>How did Mr. Llewellyn find out about the role?

Parts of north Dublin, the airport and so on are crying out for that and it seems it is disappearing further into the future every week or every month.

Let me start in a slightly different place.  The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge was the largest of its type anywhere in the world.  Yes, there were a few issues with it, but there normally are when something new of that type and at that scale is built.  TII has won international awards for that delivery.  That tells me that the management there knows how to deliver complex projects, and we know that MetroLink will be a very big, complex project.  When it is clear in the national development plan, NDP, that there is a 2:1 investment in favour of public transport, it means MetroLink is very important, not just for Dublin but for Ireland more generally.  People who live elsewhere in Ireland will come in through Dublin Airport, and access onto other forms of transport is needed.<\/p> <p>  The one thing I would reflect on, given the scale of these projects, is that the more that can be done early during the scheme design with experts sitting around the table, the better placed you will be to put the right contracts out for procurement and to manage those contracts going forward.  I will give the Senator a good example.  If you are standing on a platform and there is a metro train coming in two minutes' time, that information needs to be connected into the central control room, which then needs to be connected into the signalling system and the trains themselves.  That type of interface and the overall system integration needs to be defined right at the start, because if it is not got right, you end up with inevitable delays and cost overruns as the programme is implemented.  My advice to TII, therefore, and my stance is to make sure it gets in place experts on this in the organisation now, not in two years' time, in order that it will have the right scheme design and that, when the contracts go out, it will be clear to the people bidding what those interfaces need to be in order that they can be managed successfully from day one.  If that is not done, I think there will be, as I said, cost overruns and the projects will be delayed further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Llewellyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>It is very important that MetroLink is prioritised.  Not only is it very important for the entire region involved and the airport, but it also touches on what Mr. Llewellyn is talking about: sustainability, modal shift, reducing emissions and so on.  The number of people driving to Dublin Airport and parking there and the number of people who are not able to use public transport to get there is phenomenal.  Post pandemic, MetroLink will be very important.<\/p> <p>  I will make a final point, if I may.  As for metro safety, Mr. Llewellyn talked about the safety of light rail.  Did he mean interaction with cars or the passenger experience on board of thuggish or antisocial behaviour?<\/p> <p>  As for road safety, Mr. Llewellyn talked about demand management interventions, not just on the M50 but generally.  I know that in the UK there are average speeds on many motorways over long distances, which I do not think we have here.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to touch on the issue of the N20.  I am sure many other members will touch on it.  There was a large article in a newspaper at the weekend about it being the most dangerous road, that is, the road with the highest number of fatalities in recent years.  What does Mr. Llewellyn think he might be able to do to improve not only light rail safety on the carriages and in its interaction with everything else but also road safety generally?

I will do my best to answer them.<\/p> <p>  When I was at Network Rail, I was as much concerned with the passenger on the train as I was with anybody interacting with the train.  It does not really matter who you are; the whole purpose is to make sure those people are safe.  That extended not only to understanding at what point in the year we would see broken or buckled rails or signals passed at danger, SPADs, in certain parts, but also to people's behaviour around level crossings, for example.  We would have a significant number of serious incidents in which cars would deliberately circumvent the barriers at level crossings and come into contact with trains or have near misses.  There is a lot of behavioural change involved there.  It is very similar to being on a tram system.  How do you persuade a cyclist not to cycle across or in front of a tram, for example?  I have worked with those sorts of safety interventions for a chunk of my career at Network Rail.  I do not make a distinction between the passenger and the people outside.

As I understand it, the upgrade from the N20 to the M20 is in the NDP, so it is a project that will go ahead.  I understand that the preferred route will be known in the early part of next year and the business case will follow thereafter.

I am thinking specifically about the M50.  If there are nearly 1,200 incidents per year on that motorway, about 22 per week, and the average time for which traffic is disrupted is nearly half an hour, with some incidents lasting more than three hours, there is serious work to do there.  At the moment TII can only put up advisory signs, as the Senator will probably know, and people's general view of advisory signs is that their advice is optional and that there is no enforcement behind them.  You need to put power behind that because if there is a broken-down car in a particular lane, you need to be able to get services to that car very quickly to guarantee the safety of those people and get the traffic flowing again.  It is the same when it comes to adverse weather.  Then demand management at peak times is important because, otherwise, you effectively just create a bottleneck for people and delay them getting to their destinations.<\/p> <p>  If something is not done about demand management, it is worthwhile thinking about what the consequences will be.  You will see more safety issues so, effectively, you are saying you are prepared to tolerate people being injured or killed.  That is not a good thing.  If you want to avoid that congestion, the only other option is to build more motorways.  It seems to me that building more motorways in that context would represent poor value for money because all you would be doing is trying to build a new motorway to increase capacity at peak times.  It would not be needed at any other time of the day.  That form of demand management through enforceable, variable speed limits and dynamic management is very important.  The dynamic bit is important, of course, because you do not know when it will be required, where it will be required or for how long.  That could take you across jurisdictional boundaries, so it is important to understand the role TII has there in the context of being a road traffic organisation.

The M20, the Cork-Limerick motorway, has become a source of many accidents.

It is, effectively, mirroring what I did in my previous executive role, that is, making sure vehicles are safe to drive, people have the right skills to be able to drive properly, and there is enforcement for anybody who wishes to circumvent the rules.  We also need a safe road network because road conditions matter.  The road speed limit also matters and we need people to comply with those limits.  There is quite a strong interaction with the Road Safety Authority.  From everything I hear when talking to my colleagues in TII, there is a good working relationship between the two bodies.

I appreciate it.  He would have got a very short answer had he asked such questions.  When it comes to dynamic traffic management on the M50, as I said, there are a number of issues.  One is about road safety.  We must make sure road users can get access to assistance if their vehicles break down to protect those vehicles and to move them off the road quickly so traffic will keep moving.  When it comes to adverse weather, one needs everybody to stay safe and, therefore, being able to manage the flow at a sensible speed when there is particularly bad weather is important.  The technology enables one to do that but only if there is one thing in place, and I will come back to that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  If peak times are between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., a big chunk of the traffic includes people who are being delayed unnecessarily because of the acceleration and braking ahead of them.  Keeping that traffic flow moving in a constant way is important.  Dynamic traffic management will allow that.  However, it only works if people know they must comply through their behaviour.  If it is advisory, we know that most people will ignore that and do what they need to because, to them, their route home is the most important.  Being able to have some enforcement around that is important.<\/p> <p>  I want to make it clear, and I know the committee understands this point, that there is no financial benefit to TII from that because whatever enforcement penalties arrive do not come back to TII.  This is all about improving the efficient use of that network and road safety, which is what TII is there to do.  Whether that model can be applied elsewhere is something to consider at some point.  We need the technology in place to prove it works, and if it shows the benefits we think it will, the same approach could be rolled out elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Llewellyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>It is a proof of concept.

There is definitely an opportunity in it.  As I said, TII has an obligation to provide a safe and efficient road transport network.  We have to do that under law unless we are told by the Minister to have a derogation for a period.  When we are building changes to the roads, there is an opportunity to put cycle paths or greenways alongside them, which is something TII already is doing.  Part of the challenge in this regard is that we could end up with a greenway that is very busy because it is being built as part of an ongoing change to a road network.  It is important that whatever infrastructure is put in place, there is an awareness of how a greenway is connected up with existing cycle paths and so on to encourage active travel.  I know TII is thinking about that because it was a specific question I had.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect is making sure that when roads are designed, there are very clear views as to what elements will be public transport and which will be personal transport.  At the moment, personal transport is based on the internal combustion engine but it will, at some point, be based around electricity or hydrogen fuel.  The roads will still be needed.  It is about having enough view of what the long term is to make sure we are making decisions now that will make provision for 20, 30 or 40 years.  We are very focused on the 2:1 aspect.

Regarding inter-urban motorways, concern has been raised about the design style of some of the access and egress points to and from the main thoroughfares.  Mr. Llewellyn may not be familiar with this issue, in which case it may be a takeaway for him.  I know of a number of such junctions that I can identify for him.  The ones closest to us in Clare are the Tulla Road, Barefield and Crusheen exits.  Deputy Lowry will be familiar with another one, on the M7, which I pass every week entering Moneygall.  Coming off at that exit is particularly difficult because one is coming down an incline and pulling into a rest area and truck stop at the Barack Obama Plaza.  We have had some debate about this in the past.  Are there any discussions internally in TII about looking at and addressing those particular junctions?  I will not say they are hazardous but they certainly are suboptimal considering the volumes of traffic entering and exiting motorways.

I have some sympathy with the point the Deputy is raising.  Many years ago, I remember driving down a dual carriageway to find a vehicle coming the wrong way around a roundabout and straight towards me.  The driver was able to do that because the approach road to the roundabout was straight on rather than to the side and, in effect, he made the wrong decision.  It was exceptionally hazardous.

There is a serious question mark over our response times.  If there is any kind of incident on a motorway at present, the tailbacks and delays last many hours.  The synchronisation and co-ordination between members of the Garda leaves a lot to be desired at times.

I am halfway through my briefing.  The second half of it was due right now but has been postponed.  There is lots that I still do not understand.<\/p> <p>  As I understand it, however, the inherent asset value of the road network that the TII looks after is &euro;32 billion.  We would be stupid not to maintain that value because letting it degrade and having to rebuild it would just load a significant amount of capital cost onto the Irish taxpayer at some point in the future.  It is very important to me that we maintain what we have in good order.  To do that, it is necessary to know a lot about the condition of the asset at all times.  That is sometimes tricky, so understanding the condition of a tunnel, embankment or road requires investment, skills to interpret the data and good decision-making.  None of those are generally what I would term sexy projects; they are basic things that have to be done.  They are worthwhile doing because of the inherent value of the asset we have in Ireland.  TII will continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  I do not know the split between maintenance and enhancement, which I think is the question the Deputy asked, because I have not yet been briefed on that, but no doubt it will become clearer when we publish our annual business plan.

It involves a roundabout off the N85 on the approach to Ennis and Clarecastle.  It also has linkage to the N67 and the Kilrush road.  It is a notorious and very busy roundabout.  It is the busiest roundabout in County Clare and is very dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.  Work has nearly been completed on a greenway that runs along the banks of the River Fergus past the monument at Clareabbey.  It is a very good project that will encourage more pedestrian traffic and cyclists in the area.  Students travelling from Clarecastle to Ennis have to traverse this roundabout on a daily basis.  They are taking their lives in their hands by doing so.  This issue has been ongoing for many years.  Ideally, it should have been resolved at the design stage of the Ennis bypass and N85 link road.  I would like Mr. Llewellyn to raise this matter with the TII and have it brought to a conclusion.  A number of submissions have been made by Clare County Council, which has identified a preferred option to rectify the situation.  I ask Mr. Llewellyn, as chairperson designate, to take this issue up and bring it to a conclusion.<\/p> <p>  The other long-standing issue is that of Blake's Corner in a place called Ennistimon in north Clare.  Again, it is a very busy junction.  An inner relief road on the N67-N85 is proposed, which means a new bridge and new inner relief road will be built in Ennistimon.  Two American tourists recently crashed at Blake's Corner.  Luckily, they escaped without being hurt, but it demonstrates the problems that are there, including massive traffic congestion throughout the summer because people are going back to attractive tourist resorts, such as Liscannor, Lahinch and, in north Clare, Doolin and the Cliffs of Moher.  It is a very busy junction.  I would like Mr. Llewellyn to provide an update on that scheme too.  I understand that an oral hearing was heard last June at An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the inspector has to come back with a report.  It is important that that project is driven on, we see it realised and the congestion issues that have been experienced are dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lowry touched on this final issue.  Over the past six weeks, there have been a number of road traffic incidents and, sadly, one fatality, on the N18 road that runs from Ennis to Limerick, in particular the section from Bunratty into Limerick.  All these accidents involved heavy goods vehicles and massive delays were caused as a result.  A person passed away, which is obviously tragic for that individual and his or her family.  The delay in trying to get the road reopened, people not knowing what is happening and trying to communicate that to commuters are areas that TII will have to improve upon.  Given that there have been a number of these incidents on the N18, has Mr. Llewellyn concerns about this section of road?  Why are so many of these accidents happening?  Has the TII given any consideration to putting in some remedy to this?  I get that Mr. Llewellyn will not be familiar with these projects, but I will be happy if he would come back to me in writing regarding them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#G01000","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1412,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

TII is not a roads authority, which may be something that we will need to address at some point in the future.  As I understand it, the relationship between TII and the local authorities is pretty good because there is a network of 11 local authority national roads offices throughout the country, which work remarkably well.  That probably does not answer the Deputy's specific questions, but I am sure somebody from TII is watching this and taking notes on letters that will need to be written in response to Deputies, etc.<\/p><p>I will ensure that somebody from TII comes back to the Deputy with the detail.

I wish Mr. Llewellyn well in his new role.  I am interested in his perspective on the role of TII.  Does he think the role of roads, as we have understood them for so long in terms of carrying cars, lorries and buses, is changing, in light of the sustainable future with climate targets, a transition to increasing use of public transport, an electric car fleet and increasing the use of electrified or alternative fuels for HGVs, but particularly given the significant move towards active travel, including cycling and walking?  What does Mr. Llewellyn see as TII's role being in delivering on that type of change?  Does he think the organisation is prepared and has an important role in relation to that?  How will it ready itself for that?  Will it require, for example, different skill sets, mindsets and changes in approach to align an important organisation such as TII?  In his opening statement, Mr. Llewellyn mentioned that it is about delivering.  I am conscious that TII has taken on a new role in the delivery of greenways, which I think aligns very well with the piece on active travel.  How is the organisation going to deliver roads that serve a purpose that is more closely aligned to the climate obligations and the changes in road user, the changes in road space and the types of vehicles that are on roads?  I hope that is a clear question and Mr. Llewellyn has a sense of what I am asking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#H00200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  One thing we know about the future is that it will be different from where we are at the moment.  Preparing for that sometimes needs different structures, skills and thinking.  The most important statement is that there is always a view that roads are bad in relation to climate change, but they are not really.  It is what is on the roads that matters, because that is where most - not all - of the emissions come from.  At some point in the future, we will still need roads.  We will need them for electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles.  A new hydrogen HGV is being launched by a company called Tevva.  These vehicles are coming, and that it is a good thing, except from a congestion perspective.  Obviously, we still need to deal with congestion and the impact it has on the economy.<\/p> <p>  TII still has an important role in ensuring that the road network, in particular, supports the NDP.  Looking at the priorities, transport supports virtually all of them.  Whether it is strengthening rural communities, regional accessibility or sustainable mobility, transport is part of all of those.  Making sure that at any one point in time, one designs infrastructure to achieve the future outcomes as well as to tackle today's problems will be a factor for TII, without a doubt.<\/p> <p>  I think I mentioned in one of my previous answers that even today, TII has a preference that when it is planning new infrastructure, a greenway is part of it already.  A big challenge there is making sure that whatever greenway is introduced as part of a change to the road network is linked up with existing greenways.  There is no point in it being isolated from everything else.  It needs that joined-up approach, as part of the national cycle network, etc.  That is really important.  When planning new infrastructure, TII looks at what proportion of that infrastructure should be for personal vehicles and what should be for public transport.  Again, that is part of the overall planning process that TII will go through.<\/p> <p>  I cannot say that the organisation will not need new skills, because it probably will, because the future will be different.  It is part of the board's role in evaluating the strategy or the organisation, to take a view about whether the organisation is set up for success.  That is part of my role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Llewellyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1416,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Llewellyn envisage an expanded role for the organisation in terms of active travel, or is it more of a case of working with organisations, such as the NTA and others, in a co-ordinated way to deliver on those projects?

That is the framework within which it works.<\/p> <p>  I have not come with a mindset that this organisation needs to be 15 times bigger in ten years' time.  MetroLink is going to be one of the biggest challenges that Ireland, more generally, will face, and TII, specifically, will face.  We need to get that right.  The organisation does need to skill itself up quickly to be able to deliver MetroLink within a sensible time period and to ensure that when it goes through the implementation, there are not hold-ups and the costs do not escalate.  The best way of doing that is to get people in TII's business and experts who know what they are doing on the ground now - not in two years' time.

Does Mr. Llewellyn have a comment on the business model that operates in that way?  Obviously, there has been criticism from some quarters of the public private partnership, PPP, models.

I join previous speakers in welcoming Mr. Llewellyn.  I have read his opening statement.  I wish him the very best.  What is required of us today is a bit of a rubber-stamping exercise.  We endorse him as chair designate of TII.<\/p> <p>  The Shannon tunnel, the fantastic under-river link between Clare and Limerick, was built about 15 years ago.  Has it been utilised enough in taking HGV traffic off the orbital route network in the southern part of County Clare and Limerick city?  Mr. Llewellyn may not have an answer to my second question but perhaps he or some of his colleagues who are following this meeting might come back to me on it.  Two figures circulating in the ether relating to the Shannon tunnel are at great variance.  If phase 2 of the Limerick northern distributor road is constructed, the figure being put forward by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would suggest a significant financial hit to the Shannon tunnel and yet the figure suggested by local authorities in the mid-west is far less.  I would appreciate if TII, not today but some day, could calculate its estimate of the penalty if phase 2 were developed.  What financial hit would the Shannon tunnel suffer?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to TII and the naming of infrastructure.  Prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il, I was a member of Clare County Council.  Along with other councillors, I suggested naming roundabouts and flyover bridges after key figures, one of them being a lady from Cratloe in County Clare who died on hunger strike during the War of Independence.  She was the only member of Cumann na mBan to suffer that fate.  The country has many monuments and other memorials to men from that period but we have fewer for women.  This proposal had cross-party agreement but it fizzled out to nothing.  Does TII have a policy on that?  If it does not, I believe it needs to have one because in some places there is a desire to have bridges and other pieces of infrastructure named rather than having a series of anonymous numbers and letters behind them.<\/p> <p>  Does TII have a database of all lands that are part of future road plans?  It is important to have a database available.  Many good, layered GIS mapping systems are available.  It has become a constant theme in County Clare and elsewhere where future transport initiatives are planned in TII offices and indeed in the local authority there may well be maps giving details of future plans but many landowners may not be privy to those.  There is not a one-stop shop to get that information.  People need to know what kind of infrastructure is intended in their locality and how that interfaces with their landholdings.<\/p> <p>  For a long time, I have been asking Clare County Council to salt and grit the roads leading to Clonmoney National School.  I am glad that is now in the winter maintenance programme.  TII has a major competency in salting and gritting.  Some of its main salt barns on the Clare to Galway motorway are located just outside Ennis.  At times, when we get a hard freeze, the resources of TII could be made available beyond the national road network.  I believe it needs to play a role in making salt and grit resources available to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I know I am throwing out several questions.  I do not expect Mr. Llewellyn to have all the answers today.  There was a fabulous project in County Clare last year, but it could not proceed even though there was funding available.  It involved a series of looped walks, but it needed sanction from TII to progress.  That has become a recurring theme.  Many projects that councils heretofore would have led, now require the higher sanction of TII.  Perhaps in his tenure, Mr. Llewellyn might be able to address this matter.  TII should have a unit that engages with groups and local authorities to ensure that these kinds of projects receive the rubber-stamp and seal of approval so that they can progress.<\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. Llewellyn very well in the future.  He may be able to respond to some of those issues in a general sense now and can come back to me with some of the specifics at a later date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#J00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>I will do my best to answer some of those questions.  I will not be able to answer them all.  I have not been briefed on the issues relating to the Shannon tunnel that the Deputy flagged.  That may be coming.  I will ask somebody within TII to address that issue.<\/p> <p>  I am neutral on the naming of infrastructure.  However, TII is a non-political organisation and sometimes names can engender different feelings, which is not something that TII should be exposed to.  As I understand it, there is no policy at the moment.  Clearly, the board will need to look at that at some point in the future.  Different countries around the world take different views on it.  There are plenty of names in the US, whereas in the UK there is probably not a single name anywhere - other than those put up by graffiti.<\/p> <p>  TII is carrying out considerable work on technology on the mapping of lands to help it manage the network better and help it understand the impact of land use on roads and also to ensure that as much information as possible is accessible in the planning process.  I do not know about the status of that nor its availability.  One of the challenges in releasing information about future road networks is that it runs the risk of infrastructure being put in place that subsequently causes a problem in respect of a particular route.  We need to think about that very carefully.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a very interesting point about working with local authorities.  As I mentioned earlier, the local authorities are the roads authority for national, regional and local roads within their boundaries.  It has come as a bit of a surprise to me that TII is not a roads authority.  It may be a matter we need to address in the future.  That said, the relationship with local authorities seems to work rather well through the 11 national roads offices we have throughout the country.  If there is any sense that that is not working, clearly we would be interested in hearing those experiences so that TII can make the process work better.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy had many questions and I am not sure if I answered them all.

I am a Deputy for Limerick city and my colleagues have already made reference to the N20-M20 project.  Mr. Llewellyn is probably aware there are no motorways or dual carriageways between Cork and Limerick as there are between Cork and Dublin, Limerick and Dublin, Limerick and Galway and Galway and Dublin.  Limerick and Cork are the two largest cities outside of Dublin but they are not linked by motorway.  The distance is roughly 90 km and there is no hard shoulder on 42% of it.  I would encourage Mr. Llewellyn to read <i>The Irish Times<\/i>article, which we might send on to him, which suggests that 60 people have been killed on that route in the past 25 years and it is four times more likely to have fatalities than the average road in Ireland.  There are a huge number of access points along the route, with something like 625 access points.

From Charleville to Buttevant, it is an ordinary road with a hard shoulder, although there is a difficulty with Buttevant as there is a quarry there and it needs a major bypass.  The road then continues on to Mallow and then to Cork.  I am a great believer in seeing it in person rather than just in the abstract.  I would encourage Mr. Llewellyn to drive it when he is in Ireland next.  I assume he will be looking to do that as part of his role.<\/p><p>It is the biggest single project in Ireland.

While TII can make proposals as to what could be done, and safety is a particular issue, it has to work closely with those two organisations to make sure the right infrastructure is developed within that funding envelope.

Moving from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles is hugely important as part of our journey to net zero but it does require the electricity system to be decarbonised as well, of course, because otherwise we are just shifting the emissions somewhere else.<\/p> <p>  One of the feelings, particularly in the UK, is that for any lengthy journey, people are nervous around electric vehicles because of the range and an innate knowledge about where they may recharge their vehicle and whether the charging process is going to take too long.  All of those issues are in the hands of the manufacturers, such as battery technology and range extent.  People need to know they can get from where they are to their destination without a recharge and if they do need a recharge, that the recharge is rather quick.  I am not sure there is a huge amount that TII could do or should do.  Clearly, at the point at which we have significant numbers of electric vehicles, making sure that those recharging stations are in the right place to ensure smooth travel is hugely important.  The issues will be more about range and battery technology than it will be about charging stations necessarily.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is whether the next development is around hydrogen fuel cells and, if hydrogen fuel cells do take over from electric vehicles, whether existing fuel stations can be converted into hydrogen providing stations.  If that is the case, the way in which we drive will not be too dissimilar from where we are today.  All of those are driven more by policy than they will be by TII, although TII will have to respond to any policy change and any change in purchasing practice.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to construction more generally, there is a lot of work going on in various sectors around decarbonising construction.  I was fortunate to work for the chief executive of the organisation that built the London Olympic Games infrastructure and a huge amount of work was done there on decarbonising the construction process.  It is something TII is looking at and the more work we can do in that space, the more we will reduce our own emissions with regard to construction and the management and maintenance of the infrastructure we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Llewellyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1638316800,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>Will we get to a point where we have significant decarbonisation of the materials going into the construction of roads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021120100002#K00700","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638316800,"counter":1435,"content":"<p>I could not put a timescale on it but, ultimately, we want to be net zero by 2050 so there is a timescale that is almost inherent in all of the work we do to make sure that TII's activities are as close to zero as possible by that time.

We have information which tells people how long it should take to get from one junction to another, particularly for important junctions.  That information just provides a guide regarding there being no congestion and that traffic is heading in the right direction.  In certain parts of the country, there are variable speed limits to manage the flow of traffic.  Speed cameras are positioned along those stretches of road and drivers will get a fine if they breach the area speed limit.  That is the function of that system.  In addition, there are also variable speed limits relating to construction activity.  They tend to be average speed cameras over a longer distance.  Again, in that case, if a driver's average speed from the start to the end of such a section of road is greater than would normally be expected, which would normally be about 50 mph, or probably 80 km\/h, then those drivers would be fined.
