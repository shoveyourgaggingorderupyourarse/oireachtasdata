Those who follow the agricultural sector and food security will be very aware and particularly concerned about the recent reports from the Health and Safety Authority concerning serious breaches around public health, public safety and Covid.  This industry has a very large workforce.  Currently many workers would tell us they are forced to work in very tight, cramped conditions.  Many of the workers in the industry are afraid to report incidents because they fear they will lose their jobs.  Many of them are on very low pay and many of them are scared their work will dry up.<\/p> <p>A report published this week and referred to in all the national press relates to issues around Covid and the serious possible cross-contamination of food which, in turn, will affect our foodchain.  When there is doubt or a lack of confidence in a sector, particularly like the meat sector, it has a knock-on effect from retail to processing, back along the line to the farm gate and, ultimately, farm incomes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->People will be seriously concerned about the consumption of meat if they read in the national press and in reports about the sector, its health and safety and that of its workers.

More important is that we support them in terms of health and safety and look at the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, report.  Therefore, I suggest, if at all possible, that the Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for food safety might come to the House and allow a brief opportunity for us to put a number of questions to them.

The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should also be party to that debate.<\/p> <p>I raise the issue of the pay of contract cleaners.  As we all know, contract cleaners are some of the lowest paid across our economy.  My question, which I ask the Leader to direct to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, relates to why he is holding up the awarding of a pay increase to workers in the sector.  I will briefly provide background to this.  Contract cleaning has a joint labour committee.  This is where employers and workers come together to decide the rates of pay.  Earlier this year, they decided that a pay increase of 40 cent should be awarded from 1 December.  The Labour Court adopted this employment regulation order on 4 November and that document has been sitting in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment since 4 November, waiting for a ministerial signature to give statutory effect to the employment regulation order.  We are still waiting, as of this morning, for that.  It is not acceptable that contract cleaners or any other workers should be left waiting for their pay increase when it has been agreed between employers and worker representatives.  I ask the Leader to get an answer from the Minister.  If he is not prepared to sign it today, he should come into the House and explain why.<\/p> <p>I will] raise a second issue relating to the arts sector and some concerns articulated in recent days regarding the allocation of funding.  To be clear, the recent initiatives by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, with regards to the arts sector have been welcome, in terms of the various supports that have been put in place in the music sector and in the theatre and performance sector overall.  However, there are clear concerns with regard to the transparency with which those grants are made, fairness and feedback.  I understand that a number of applicants have not received feedback as to why they have not received a grant and are looking at others who have.  The important point is that these supports in many cases will be the difference between people remaining in the arts sector or being forced to leave a sector they love and have given a lifetime to.  I ask, as we have asked previously, for the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to come into this House to debate these issues.  It is important that we have a better understanding of the supports that are in place and plans for future supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#B00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Ireland has a long history of friendship with the people of Ethiopia.  It saddens us all to hear recent reports of atrocities and identity-based attacks across the country.  With the regional communications blackout, it is difficult to verify the number of deaths and we know thousands have been displaced and will face an uncertain winter.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coveney's, call last week for all parties to cease hostilities and de-escalate tensions.  Ethiopia has seen extraordinary changes in the past years, most notably, making peace with neighbouring Eritrea and long overdue political and public service reforms.  Change is welcomed by the clear majority of Ethiopian citizens but this might threaten and frighten others.  Old rivalries between ethnic groups are re-emerging with brutal consequences and there are now reportedly 3 million displaced people in the country.<\/p> <p>The Tigray region is known as the cradle of Ethiopian civilization and its people have long held senior and important positions across all parts of the Ethiopian Government.  The EU and Ireland must do all in their power to prevent the emergence of a larger conflict, which could unleash international ethnic fighting throughout Ethiopia and have devastating consequences across the entire Horn of Africa.  Both sides have thus far refused UN and African Union calls for dialogue.  Given the long-standing role of Irish humanitarians, diplomats and peacekeepers, the wonderful role they have played in the region and our aid relationship with the Ethiopian Government, I believe Ireland can play a greater role in reconciliation.  Irish Aid already provides support to small farmers in Tigray through a range of sustainable practices and I ask the Minister to come into the House to give an update as to whether these operations have been affected during the recent instability and as to whether there are plans to extend such initiatives and offer emergency aid in the coming months.<\/p> <p>Ireland, with its respected reputation, could trigger much-needed dialogue in this northern region of Ethiopia.  Ireland could be instrumental in brokering peace.  It is of concern for many Irish people who have nothing but love for the Ethiopian people and what they are going through at the moment as we approach Christmas.  I tried unsuccessfully to seek a Commencement matter on two occasions but I understand how pressured that time is so I am using the Order of Business to ask the Leader to invite the Minister into the House to give us an update on the precise situation, which is of deep concern to many Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#B00300","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Cheannaire as ucht an Oird Gn&oacute; a leagan os &aacute;r comhair.  As the Leader knows, last week the Taoiseach met Pat Finucane's wife Geraldine and their son John and unequivocally supported the family's demand for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat.  In this Chamber, the Minister for Foreign Affairs endorsed that Government support and the Seanad unanimously supported the family's call for a public inquiry.  John attended the Seanad debate and he spoke personally at last week's Good Friday Agreement committee about the loss of his father and the impact of his murder on his mother and his family.  Yesterday, the British Government rallied around to protect and defend those in the British Cabinet who sanctioned the murder of Pat Finucane through collusion over 30 years ago.  Reacting last night to that decision, Pat's son John stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOur initial reaction is that we are very angry.  I would like to say that we are surprised.  But what the British Government proposed to us today was nothing short of insulting.  We have waited for nearly two years for the government to respond to our supreme court victory in 2019.  We have been waiting 31 years for an effective investigation into the murder of my father.  What was presented today, I think, once again, if we needed another example, we were presented with it today, is, that the British government at every opportunity will continue to make the wrong decision, and will put all their efforts into ensuring that the truth as to what happened in the murder of my father, that the full truth, will not see the light of day.  And they are intent on suppressing that truth.  And today's meeting confirms that again to our family.  To dangle this statement, that he is not ruling out an inquiry, 31 and a half years after my father was murdered; some nine years after David Cameron accepted that there was collusion; five years after De Silva reported; two years after the supreme court have given their judgement.  To say today quite casually that he is not ruling out an inquiry I feel is insulting.  We had police investigations before.  We had the police investigation after my father was murdered.  We also had a police investigation by the most senior police officer in the UK, John Stevens, now Lord Stevens.  The Supreme Court dismissed that as not being an effective investigation.  So to sit in a room with us today and present this as something credible and ask for us to support that; I thought it was astonishing and I thought it was exceptionally arrogant and cruel of the Secretary of State on behalf of his Government.  <\/blockquote> <p>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Seanad with one voice supported the Finucane family and their call for an independent public inquiry.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have also received substantial bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.  Yesterday's decision by the British Government was cruel and crass.  Last week, An Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Seanad sent a powerful and personal message of support to the Finucane family.  That message remains with them today and will help them absorb yesterday's shocking and indefensible decision.  Yesterday, Pat's widow, Geraldine, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt would seem to me there is a lot to hide.  So the idea is to just delay and delay and to hope as I get older I will pop my clogs and the investigation will stop.  But believe you me with every breath in my body I will fight them to the bitter end and I will make them responsible for what they did. <\/blockquote><p>We wrote to Geraldine to continue to stand with her and family in that fight, to Pat, to truth and to justice and to all those campaigning for the same.  The Weston Park agreement has been wilfully ignored.  The full authority of the office of An Taoiseach is being wilfully ignored, as are the unanimous and unified voice of the Oireachtas and the importance of the people, here at home and throughout the world, who put on this campaign.  The British Government is even ignoring its own Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>The Finucane family and the people must now hear what the Government intends to do about it.  As Geraldine put it so well on RT&Eacute; Radio this morning:<\/p><blockquote>\tToday is a new day.

I do not want to go into all this again, but there is clear evidence of the collusion that went on.  It is appalling that, even at this late stage, the British authorities will not own up and give in to this public inquiry.  It is really sad for us all.  I am sure the Government will again take up the baton and fight hard to get this inquiry.  I will raise this matter at our parliamentary party meeting later.<\/p> <p>I turn to Covid-19 because, in many respects, this is a good day.  The retail sector has got up and running.  We look forward to Friday, when restaurants, hotels and other services will reopen.  Walking from my hotel to Kildare Street earlier, I was keeping an eye on the trains as they travelled through the city.  I have to say \"Fair play\" to the public.  While quite a number of people were on the trains, or as many as are allowed at the moment, I did not see anybody without a mask.  The people are really coming to terms with the message that we must wear masks.  All of us have to understand that the Government had to do a little bit of tightrope walking, both by taking on board what the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, recommended, which is very important, and by seeking some type of meaningful Christmas, although we all know it will not be the same as usual.  Older people I have spoken to in recent days have said they have arranged with their family that one wing of the family will visit on Christmas Day and another on St. Stephen's Day, and they have worked that out.  We all have to do things differently because of where we are at the moment.<\/p> <p>I compliment the people, who are treating this terrible pandemic in what is probably a more serious way than they had previously.  I do not say that lightly.  Perhaps how we viewed the pandemic in the first four months is different from how we view it now.  We all thought it would be a passing storm but now we know it is not.  Even with vaccination, it will still be some time before we end up getting the virus under control, but we are moving in the right direction.  I firmly believe, and I am sure the Leader will refer to this in her response, that if we wear masks, wash our hands, observe social distancing, we can keep down the numbers.  I appeal to everyone, including all Senators, that we do what we are asked to do, have a Christmas and, at the same time, try to keep the numbers low.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#C00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I fully agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile about the Pat Finucane decision and the behaviour of the British Government.  I think we may all have been laid into a space where we believed an inquiry would be announced yesterday.  I certainly believed it would be and all the mood music suggested that, especially in view of the fact that the highest court in the UK had recommended it.  What has happened is regrettable and, certainly, the campaign cannot stop.  Let us hope that, eventually, the right thing will be done.<\/p> <p>Today is World AIDS Day.  While we are in the middle of a pandemic, the world keeps moving and there are other serious diseases and health challenges.  In the 1980s and the early 1990s, AIDS was a serious challenge but the world came together to try to deal with it.  It is not as big a challenge as it was, but it is still a challenge and we cannot forget that because much work continues to be done and needs to be done in the eradication of AIDS and dealing with HIV, particularly in Third World and developing countries.  We should redouble our efforts and commitment as a country to funding programmes in the developing world to help combat the spread of HIV and AIDS.  At some stage in the new year, it would be no harm to hold a debate on our world development programme and the overseas aid that is provided by this country.  We could include world health programmes in that.<\/p> <p>Today is a good day in terms of Covid-19 but the deputy chief medical officer put it well when he said that just because we can do something, it does not mean we have to.  I call on the Chief Medical Officer, the Minister for Health and the Department of Health not to release Covid-19 figures or death numbers on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day.  We have all got used to seeing the notifications on our phones at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. giving us the latest update on the numbers of cases and deaths.  On some days it is good news, while on many others, it is not.  It would be appropriate if the figures were not released on those three days of Christmas.  I am sure they could be released at a later date.  Everybody needs a break from that news cycle for those three days and I make that suggestion respectfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#C00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I second Senator Boyhan's proposal that No. 24, motion 8, on the Order Paper be taken before No. 1.<\/p> <p>I join colleagues in expressing my deep disappointment with respect to the Finucane murder.

It was recently bought by Hines which is planning to put in a planning application to develop it and the site surrounding it.  Back in 2018, while I was a member of Dublin City Council, I got the local authority area committee to pass a motion asking that it be immediately put on the record of protected structures.

Two years later there was no movement on this.<\/p> <p>The person who succeeded me on Dublin City Council tabled a motion to the full council meeting asking all council members that it be added to the record of protected structures.

Two arms of a local authority asked for it to be put on the record of protected structures, as did the then Minister.  We have a chance of keeping this building, yet we are taking the word of a developer and an executive decision has been made.

The theatre would be happy to operate with just 50 patrons.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The arts sector is not about making money.  Rather, it is about ensuring that engagement is maintained for artists and audiences in order to keep the sector alive.  Likewise, Forum Wateford, a bingo venue, has to remain closed under level 3.  Nobody can tell me that a venue which has the capacity to hold 600 people cannot operate safely with 50 patrons in attendance.  People can scoff at the idea of bingo, but Forum Waterford is an alcohol-free and socially-distanced venue that can operate safely and that should be allowed to do so.<\/p><p>When asked by a reporter at yesterday's media briefing to explain if there is a particular risk associated with theatres over cinemas, Dr. Tony Holohan said NPHET had not given any consideration to distinguishing between the risks that applied to the two settings.  He went on to say that cinemas are allowed to open in level 3.  I am sure the Leader will agree that is a contradictory message.  The reason no consideration has been given to it is that there is no difference between a cinema and a theatre.<\/p><p>I am sure we all watched \"The Late Late Toy Show\" on Friday with great joy and saw children singing, dancing and performing.  Stage schools have not been given the opportunity to reopen, despite operating successfully during the summer.  Not every child wants to be involved in sport, which is something I know as a former PE teacher.  It is essential for children to be able to engage in activity outside of their households.  I believe stage schools can operate safely.  I ask the Minister to invite the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, to the House as a matter of urgency for a debate on the sector and these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#D00600","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I echo the comments that have been made and express my disappointment about the decision of the British Government not to hold an independent inquiry into the case of Pat Finucane.<\/p> <p>I also echo the comments of Senator Cummins.  It does not make sense that cinemas, galleries and museums can open, yet theatres, which are safe and controlled environments, are kept closed.  We will see far more people in retail outlets and supermarkets over the next few weeks than we will see in theatres.  When theatres were permitted to open earlier this year, they were able to do so in a very safe and controlled way and they provided people with an opportunity for entertainment.  I ask that consideration be given, in particular coming up to the Christmas period, to examining how our theatres can reopen.<\/p> <p>We have asked on a number of occasions for a debate on the rule of law in Hungary and Poland.  People will be aware that yesterday the Dutch Parliament voted to force its Government to take action before the European Court of Justice against Poland for breaches of Article 7 of the EU treaties.  It is no longer acceptable that Poland and Hungary are holding vetoes at a European level, where they are constantly breaching the rule of law, there is no respect for the judiciary or freedom of the press and where minorities, in particular the LGBT minority in Poland, are being treated with such disrespect.

I refer to the Christmas bonus and, more importantly, the fact it is not paid to people who are on maternity leave.  Next year I would love those who are on maternity leave at Christmas to be eligible for the Christmas bonus scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, talked about the Christmas bonus last week, which is incredible.  She encouraged people to spend that money locally.  This is money that, in the first instance, goes back into local economies.  That is important.  People who are on maternity leave have paid their taxes, worked in jobs and contributed to the economy.  They will contribute to the economy when they finish maternity leave.  The payment will not be given to everyone who is on maternity leave; it will only be paid to those who are on maternity leave during the Christmas period.  According to the Department's website, more than 30 groups of people avail of the Christmas bonus.  They include those in receipt of the State pension, invalidity pension, the back to work enterprise allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance.  It is important that we include people in receipt of maternity benefit in that cohort.  It is too late to do anything about it this year.  I would appreciate if we could have a discussion or debate about this issue so that it can be put on the agenda for Christmas 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#E00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I echo the statements of many Senators who have wished all of the businesses that are opening up today well.  In that context, I wish all of the businesses in Tipperary well.  They have had an incredibly tough number of weeks and I hope the Christmas period is a success for them.  I encourage everyone to support them.<\/p> <p>There is some confusion about whether craft fairs can go ahead.  Fethard Horse Country Experience in Tipperary has hosted a Christmas craft fair for the past two years.  It has proved very popular and has been a source of income for stall holders who provide a great variety of Christmas gifts for their customers.  This year, the organisers considered holding the fair again but making it an open-air event on the main street in Fethard.  They put feelers out to check the viability of such a plan and determine whether there was interest.  They found there was overwhelming interest from stall holders who wished to take part.  They planned to hold it on Friday, 11 December from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.  There is plenty of room on the main street, which has wide footpaths and plenty of space for stalls to be socially distanced.  I understand under the latest Covid restrictions the fair may not be able to go ahead.  I have spoken to Councillor Mark Fitzgerald who has worked extremely hard to try to resolve the issue locally.  A committee is meeting tomorrow to discuss where the fair goes from here, just ten days before the planned event.  There are numerous craft fairs across Tipperary and the country that want to go ahead.  I would appreciate if the Leader can give us clarity from the Minister for Health on whether craft fairs can happen.  If farmers markets can go ahead, craft fairs held in a safe outdoor setting should also be allowed.  If I could get some clarification on that it would be welcome for those involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#E00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I concur with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's contribution on the Pat Finucane case.  It was a very disappointing decision by the UK Government yesterday.  One might say it was to be expected but it was hugely disappointing nonetheless.  My thoughts are with the Finucane family and what they have gone through and are still going through on and issue that deserves a full public inquiry.<\/p> <p>Another issue the Leader was familiar with in her former Department is the certification of deaths abroad.  As she knows, the family of an Irish citizen who dies abroad finds it difficult to get a death certificate in this jurisdiction.  We passed legislation a number of years ago to rectify this matter.  I worked with the then Minister, Joan Burton, at the time.  Legislation was enacted and received widespread support across both Houses at the time.  There were further delays in putting in place the process to ensure that those certificates could be awarded to the families and loved ones of those who died aboard.  I ask the Leader for an update on this issue.  She will be familiar with the industrial relations issues in the Department that was dealing with this issue.  We have done the heavy lifting here, as have departmental officials in terms of ensuring this process is put in place, yet we cannot sort out the final and most important issue, namely, providing certificates for the loved ones of those who, unfortunately, passed away abroad.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask that the Leader seek an update on this very important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#E00500","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Before I call on the Leader, I also pay tribute to Geraldine Finucane for her courage, resilience and relentless pursuit of justice for the murder of her husband, Pat Finucane.

I am very happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business and we can take No. 24, motion 8, before No. 1.<\/p> <p>A number of sectoral debates have been requested which I will certainly attend to at the end of the Order of Business.  I will attempt to arrange them as quickly as I can.  The time will be difficult for us between now and Christmas but I agree with a number of speakers this morning on employment rights, particularly in our retail sector.  We have a rolling suspension of redundancies in all sectors, and rightly so, to protect businesses that are still viable albeit vulnerable.  However, I agree with Senator Gavan that we have a tsunami of potential redundancies, particularly across our retail sector.  This is not just because they have been so adversely affected over the last nine or ten months and will continue to be so until we see a widespread roll-out of the vaccine, but it is also because over the last nine to ten months the changes in our habits are going to drastically devastate the high streets in our cities and towns and probably even more so in many of our large shopping centres.  The task force may need to be set up immediately and I will send a letter to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this issue.  I will also ask about the delay.  I am unsure as to why there is one as today is 1 December.  Those sectoral arrangements agreed between employers and employees have to be respected and should not be delayed.  I will try to find out today what the status of these are and will contact the Senator&rsquo;s office later on.<\/p> <p>A debate that is needed before Christmas concerns the arts.  It has already been requested by my office and by a number of Senators today.  It was raised by colleagues last week on the introduction of the minimum universal payment as a pilot in the arts sector.  The Minister would very much welcome coming in and extolling her values.  The payment is not just to that sector but that is where the pilot is.  However, there are some difficulties within the sector.  There are some sectors within our arts community that are not able to avail of the supports that are there and nobody seems to know why.  There are some diverging rules or guidance being put out there.  I have a gentleman called Nev Ross who contacts me at least two to three times a week who raises the issues that Senator Cummins has raised.  I do not understand how it is okay for our under-14 boys in Ratoath to play football on a Tuesday and Thursday night but it is not okay for under-ten little girls to go to their dance class in the hall outside our community centre.  There are diverging and contradictory rules and that is just one example.<\/p> <p>It is sometimes difficult for people to understand and accept guidance or rules which are obviously only given on behalf of either NPHET, the State or Government to protect us, as to why one thing is okay and another thing is not.  There is an Irish saying that when we are given an inch, we want a mile, which is probably true.   The overall message, however, which we must try to remember not just as representatives standing up here, is to say that if it is okay for footballers why is it not okay for dancers, or if it is okay for cinemas why is it not okay for theatres, and please God bring bingo back, because it is definitely okay for bingo halls that can hold 600 people.  Bingo is definitely an activity that our older people need.  However, we need to be mindful that while everything is okay, we then have millions of people churning around the country, and it is that movement which is the problem.  We probably do have to recognise and accept in our representations that what is limited is probably precious and we will not get the blanket opening up of all sectors - even though it is difficult to understand why one is okay and the other is not - until we see a full roll-out of the vaccine.  We need to have that conversation and debate and, particularly, we need from the Minister&rsquo;s perspective to hear our views on how the arts industry needs to continue to be supported.  It is definitely an industry that does not make any money and there is nobody in the arts industry floating around on &euro;100 million yachts.  That task force is something that would be very useful and I will write to the Minister today on behalf of Senator Gavan and others who have brought up employment rights, particularly in less well-paid sectors.<\/p> <p>I will come back to Senator Martin on the issue of Ethiopia.  I do not know if I will be able to facilitate a debate between now and Christmas.  However, I should definitely be able to get a written response on what the Government&rsquo;s reaction is and what supports the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, plans on behalf of the State to look after a nation that is very proud but so vulnerable at the moment, not least because of Covid-19, but it also has so many other issues.<\/p> <p>It is probably unusual that either this House or the other House ever unite entirely on an issue.  We saw last week the unification of this House, the Government and every party in support and recognition of a need for a public inquiry that was mooted by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, eight or nine years ago because of what he believed was irrefutable evidence that there was collusion in the murder of Pat Finucane.  I have to pay tribute to the stoicism and strength of Mrs. Finucane.  To watch her yesterday and her resolve after 30 years is quite something to behold when one considers everything that family has been through.  There is no doubt that there was significant disappointment felt yesterday, not least on behalf of the family, but by all of their supporters and every right-minded person in this country.  The difficulty with looking at the past is that it causes hurt.  The recognition that if we are to heal, then the truth has to be told, and only then can healing begin, is something that every single one of us knows.  Some 31 years later, yesterday, one can still see the hurt that Geraldine Finucane feels.  That is true of every other family who have suffered at the hands of atrocities in our country over the last two to three generations.  There has to be a recognition and an acknowledgement all around that hurt will only heal when there is truth and a ceasing of the glorification of what went on during those 30 years.  I do not know what the Government&rsquo;s response is going to be this morning but I know that it is discussing it at Cabinet.  If the Minister does not make a statement later today I will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach what their response is.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach will liaise with the Finucane family.  We all need to recognise, finally, once and for all, that the only way that we can heal is for the truth to come out, painful, sordid and ugly as it is.  Without that healing and the justice, there will be no moving forward for this country because people will always harbour some sense of anger and despair at what went on in the past.  We need to be grown-up once and for all as states and, particularly, as governments.  The British Government&rsquo;s decision was very disappointing yesterday and our actions now need to ensure that we make it known to it what we want and what will be needed to resolve 30 to 35 years of hurt and pain.<\/p> <p>I do not have an answer on the resolutions for Senator Ahearn.  The regulations will be issued today by the Department of Health on what can and cannot happen safely over the next couple of weeks while we are in level 3 and indeed when we open our counties to allow people to visit their families over Christmas.  If it does not include the Senator&rsquo;s markets, which is exactly the same as a farmers&rsquo; markets except that it is selling different items such as crafts, it may again not make any sense, but I hope that it does.  I will find out the position for the Senator later today.<\/p> <p>In my closing comments I note that the last couple of months have been completely crap for everybody and very bad for many of our citizens.  As an auld one I got such great joy out of \"The Late Late Show\" on Friday night.  I do not have small children any more but yet every one of my near-adult children sat in the sitting room with us and it was an enormous tonic to see Adam, Saoirse, John the hospital porter and the great Irish spirit that exists where millions of euro were donated to children&rsquo;s charities because of the goodwill of the Irish people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On behalf of all of us, I hope, I say \"hats off and congratulations\" not only to Ryan Tubridy but to the entire production team and every child and his or her family who participated in giving Ireland such a great joy on Friday night.

We have a report coming out that will raise hurt, fear and anxiety among survivors and I hope that we can, for the want of a better word, take an holistic approach to this.  We need to look after these women and adoptees.  We must prioritise them for mental health supports.  Women who do not want to be found must have their privacy protected.

As they know, I received the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes on 30 October.  As Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned, the report has been years in the making and survivors want to see it published soon.  I share that wish.  It is important that this report be published so that all of us can collectively understand better the experiences of the women who were in mother and baby homes and the experiences of the children who were born there.<\/p> <p>Once the Government has given approval for publication of the report, I will engage directly with former residents as key stakeholders who are central to these issues and provide them with the details of the report and the proposed next steps.  I am acutely conscious of the anticipation experienced by former residents and their families awaiting the publication of this report and I reassure Senators that there will be no undue delay in bringing the report forward for publication.<\/p> <p>I have already been in direct contact with a considerable number of former residents by telephone and, in line with commitments already in place in this regard, my Department will make contact directly with former residents through existing communication channels to inform them of these matters before they are brought into the public domain.  There is already a dedicated telephone information line available within my Department.  Those details are available on the Department's website for people seeking further information on related matters.  Once the publication is announced, these details will be widely advertised on various platforms to again inform key stakeholders of the details.  There is also a telephone line already available for people seeking details of counselling support available to those affected by these issues.  All of these numbers have been provided to former residents and their supporters and will be publicised on the websites of my Department and the HSE.  My officials have liaised with the national counselling service to ensure that capacity is primed to respond to any increased demand for the service which may arise on foot of publication of the report, both during office hours and in respect of an out-of-hours service.<\/p> <p>I want to be as clear as possible on the matter of records.  The archive of the commission of investigation is still in the commission's possession.  The Government's intention is to publish the commission's report as soon as possible.  As such, the archive will not be transferred to my Department prior to the publication of the report.  This means that I will not be able to provide copies of personal data to survivors in advance of receiving the archive.  The archive will be transferred to my Department by 28 February next, as provided for in the legislation.  Thereafter, my Department will be able to process subject access requests from people who want access to their records.  My Department is working intensively to ensure that it is properly resourced to handle subject access requests and can provide people with as much personal data as possible.<\/p> <p>I cannot make an absolute commitment that the Department will be able to provide unredacted records in all cases.  As we discussed during the debates, the right to personal data under Article 15 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is not absolute.  Release of personal data must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, and this test must always be applied when considering whether to release personal data.  It is a legal requirement to apply this test in each case and in some circumstances, this is likely to mean that certain records may be redacted or partly redacted.<\/p> <p>In all my engagements on the commission's records, I have always been clear that applying GDPR will not resolve all issues around access to information.  This issue underlines the importance of enacting robust information and tracing legislation.  I have given a commitment in this regard to bring forward fresh proposals on information and tracing next year.  The intention is that the legislation will support individuals to access more information than is currently accessible to them under GDPR or the Freedom of Information Act.  I am committed to this legislation to ensure that we can provide people with the identity information they need, with the necessary wraparound supports for all involved.  I will meet with my officials about the specific legislation later today and look forward to working with all Senators in advancing the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#J00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The two Senators have a minute between them to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#J00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I will be brief if I only have 30 seconds.

It has been quite a while since we met in County Kilkenny.  I congratulate him on his elevation to this great office.<\/p> <p>The Project Ireland 2040 plan goes a long way back and much work has been done on it.  Its inception was to iron out some of the problems that may have arisen in the previous plan.  It is not just from a development point of view but I fundamentally believe there are serious cracks in this plan, which will unfold in an extreme manner over the next year or two.<\/p> <p>I will give one example where I was contacted by a Longford-Westmeath constituent.  The Minister of State is familiar with a town called Castlepollard in which there was a development called Cluain Mullan, which is an estate of 30-odd houses.  The developer built out his first section of 22 houses and followed on with another eight houses.  Between social housing and affordable housing, Westmeath County Council and the community benefited by approximately ten houses out of that 30, which was a great success.<\/p> <p>Part of the field, however, was heretofore zoned.  It was de-zoned under the previous monster plan to de-zone all these lands that were not in use.  This shows an example of a builder who was on a site building but whose lands were de-zoned.  He is the only active builder in Castlepollard at present.  It is a provincial town, which are graded on their size and development.  It is called a grade 3, or category 3, from a development point of view.<\/p> <p>This guy can build; he has the wherewithal and he is on site.  The development plan has come up in County Westmeath; that is my example.  Perhaps, he has four acres left in his field, which was previously zoned but has been taken out.  The councillors in Westmeath sought to put it back in, and under the new national framework, Westmeath County Council has said there can be no further developments in towns such as Castlepollard, Kinnegad or all these different towns.  <\/p> <p>The amount of stuff that has been rejected includes small, piecemeal sections of lands that councillors have sought to zone but have been told \"No\".  This is fundamentally wrong, particularly where a developer is on site building and working with the community.  This is crazy; we will never build anything.  If they were seeking to build somewhere out the road or elsewhere, well and good, but as part of our greater plan we are trying to encourage people to build in towns and villages.<\/p> <p>I am surprised, given the Minister's Green Party background and the areas in which he has been active.  I have followed much of the work he has done over the years.  This, however, is a no-brainer to get people into settled areas where they have sewerage, water and all the facilities.  The councillors had to vote against this, of course, to vary the plan.  It will now have to go to the regulator to examine it under the new Act and, possibly, onto the Minister.  I do not know.  I believe the regulator makes the decision and, perhaps, the Minister looks at it from there.<\/p> <p>That is just one example, aside from getting onto one-off housing or anything to that effect.  There is, therefore, a fundamental problem if reasonably large towns such as Castlepollard, Moate, Kinnegad or Delvin, which have what were naturally zoned sites in infilled sites, cannot develop in particular sites.  The Minister of State will have to review this plan because we said we will build 550,000 houses by 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#K00300","speaker":"1652"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The Senator's four minutes are up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#K00400","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Over the last number of years, we built between 15,000 and 18,000 houses.

I will, however, specifically reference the issues the Senator spoke about.<\/p> <p>First, to clarify, the national planning framework does not either remove one-off local needs planning for rural houses or impose rezoning or de-zoning population caps.  The national planning framework provides important national rural planning policies supporting the growth and regeneration of our rural areas, including new housing for local communities.  National policy objective, NPO, 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, such as the Senator spoke about.<\/p> <p>NPO 15 is supplemented by national policy objective 19, which aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining.<\/p> <p>I consider that these NPF objectives represent a balanced approach, consistent with long-standing Government policies on sustainable development and previous planning guidelines.  Under the sustainable rural housing guidelines of 2005, planning authorities are required to frame their development plan policies in a balanced and measured way that ensures housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.<\/p> <p>The NPF objectives, together with the 2005 guidelines, therefore, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas in a structured and considered manner.<\/p> <p>Turning to the anticipated population growth within individual counties, this issue is central to NPF strategy which projects growth in our national population of over 1 million people by 2040.  This projection is based on demographic and econometric projections undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  To assist in the preparation of individual city or county development plans, over much shorter six-year timelines, an NPF roadmap circular was issued to all planning authorities in 2018, setting out projected county population ranges for both 2026 and 2031.<\/p> <p>Importantly, this approach includes minimum and maximum population growth parameters, which provide flexibility to accommodate factors such as lower or higher migration correlated regarding national economic conditions.  These projections provide a targeted base for each planning authority to undertake the statutory development plan review process, some of which are now under way across the country.<\/p> <p>The NPF population projections provide a coherent approach whereby, in its development plan, each planning authority has clear population growth parameters to consider on the basis for strategic decision making in the formulation of its core strategy, settlement strategy and housing policies generally.  Regarding zoning policies, each planning authority retains the decision-making function whereby county level population target ranges may be translated into geographical zones for housing.  Planning authorities must consider such decisions in accordance with national guidelines, regional policy and good planning generally, in particular ensuring there is a strong alignment to the facilities and services needed to support local communities and sustainable employment.<\/p> <p>To the core of the point raised by the Senator, I believe he is absolutely right.  It is correct to say we should be clustering housing, insofar as we can, in and around existing urban settlements to give capacity but also to unlock the potential in our town centres of buildings that are already there.  That is core to what the Government is trying to achieve through the \"town centre first\" policy, where there is access to services, they are walkable and cycleable, give capacity to our shops and are connected into waste water infrastructure.<\/p> <p>In answer to the Senator's question, it is important that local authorities strike that balance between achieving good capacity and building the capacity of our town centres.  I believe that is the point the Senator raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#K00800","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The councillors had to use their practicality and went against better advice, which will now be sent to the regulator because they were not part of the development plan drawn up by the executive.<\/p> <p>There is a serious problem and this will happen in counties everywhere.

Will he make that statement in the context of the global Covid-19 pandemic?  Our obligations in terms of international protection have never been as important as they are now given the global emergency that is happening.  We know that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration and the UN World Food Programme have all reported the massive exacerbation of pressure on vulnerable peoples throughout the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  As of August, we know that 79 million people have been displaced globally because of the pandemic.  These are the figures from the UNHCR.  It is a global crisis.<\/p> <p>I am extremely concerned that 469 deportation orders have been issued since March.  I have received very concerned queries from a number of international protection applicants and from their communities.  At a time we are told travel is to be restricted, the receipt of a letter telling people they need to leave the country or they will face the threat of deportation or they might be deported at any moment is deeply distressing not just for individuals but for their partners, their families and the communities in which they are involved.  Many of those receiving these letters are very active in their communities.  They are community volunteers.  Some of them are extremely talented artists.  We know that some of them are health workers or care workers.  We have people who are part of the fabric of communities trying to help those communities through difficult circumstances and a letter like this adds great distress.<\/p> <p>What is the rationale behind the issuing of such letters and deportation orders during a global emergency?  What considerations have been given to the principle of non-refoulement, which is that people should not be deported into a situation where their lives may be threatened due to various factors such as their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or a political opinion, if it is the case that these categories would lead to somebody having difficulty accessing health services, or that the very process of being forced to travel during a pandemic could endanger somebody's life?  There is a real concern about the absence of protection and the lack of access to necessary healthcare and protection if we are sending people into those circumstances and, in some cases, into very overburdened health systems.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach has indicated with regard to a particular case where two healthcare workers were issued with deportation orders that they would not be deported to Covid-19 hotspots.  Is this the Taoiseach's statement or a departmental policy with regard to deportations?  Are other considerations being made with regard to these orders and the risks of international travel?<\/p> <p>Either by means of statutory instrument or legislation, I urge the Minister of State to indicate how he intends to engage on this issue?  Will he look at a cessation of the issuing of deportation orders during the Covid-19 pandemic or at least during emergency periods such as we are in at present?  Will he look at statutory instruments or legislation, including, potentially, the powers he might have under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act?

The Minister is aware that it has been a cause of significant concern in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>I assure the House that our objective is to have decisions made as soon as possible on international protection applications and permission to remain considerations.  This approach means that those who are found to be in need of protection will receive it quickly and can begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.  For those found not to be in need of protection, we can offer them assistance to return to their home country.  This objective of timely decision making is shared by the expert group led by Dr. Catherine Day, whose report the Ministers for Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, published recently.<\/p> <p>For those found not to be in need of international protection a full consideration of all aspects of their case is considered before a deportation order is made.  This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work situation, among other issues.  The principle of non-refoulement applies to these decisions.  Under international human rights law, the principle of non-refoulement guarantees that no one should be returned to a country where they would face torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and other irreparable harm.<\/p> <p>During the early stages of the pandemic, it was decided to issue positive recommendations only from the international protection office.  The aim of this approach was to ensure applicants with negative recommendations were not disadvantaged by the time limits set out in the legislation within which they must make an appeal or request a review of a refusal of permission to remain.  Once substantive processing and appeal hearings recommenced in more recent months, so too did the issuing of negative decisions.  While the number of negative decisions did not increase, there was a build-up in the issuing of such decisions, with a higher volume than normal issuing once processing recommenced.<\/p> <p>When individuals are advised of their negative international protection decision they are informed that they no longer have permission to remain in the State.  Under the relevant primary legislation on this issue, they are required to confirm within five days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which the Department of Justice will provide assistance.  If they do not confirm that they will leave voluntarily, a deportation order will then be made against them.<\/p> <p>That said, a pragmatic approach is taken and, to be clear, the person is not required to remove themselves from the State within five days, they are required to indicate an intent to do so.  The time taken for relevant voluntary return arrangements to be made will take into account all factors, including Covid restrictions and the limitations to travel this has created.  Having said that, the Minister has previously stated that particular issues clearly arise with level 5 restrictions and, as a result, the letters may have inadvertently caused distress.  The Minister, therefore, asked her officials to review the process of issuing such letters during the restrictions.  I understand that no letters have issued since.<\/p> <p>The expert group led by Dr. Catherine Day has recommended that the five-day period for deciding whether to accept voluntary return should be extended to 30 days.  This, along with all other recommendations relevant to the work of the Department, will be actively considered by the programme board that the Minister has established for this purpose.  Its work will feed into the development of the White Paper by the end of this year, in line with the programme for Government commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#L00400","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I strongly suggest that the Department return to the position of only issuing positive decisions during this period.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House today, World AIDS Day.  This is a worldwide health day with the theme of global solidarity and shared responsibility in fighting the stigma of HIV and AIDS in our country and in the world.  I tabled this matter and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing both myself and Senator Warfield to raised two different Commencement matters on World AIDS Day on sexual health strategy, which for the current five-year period is about to expire.  I hope it just does not run out and that the next strategy is consultative because it is important that we renew our focus on tackling HIV through rapid testing, accessibility and collaboration between all the stakeholders involved and the NGOs.  In particular, I pay tribute to the sexual health clinic in Cork and HIV Ireland for the work that they are doing.  I also want to thank the State agencies under the remit of the Minister of State and to compliment him on the work that he is doing as Minister of State in the time that he has been in this position.  I know that he has been very proactive on this particular issue.<\/p> <p>The sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme has helped to fund and provide seed capital to meet our aspirations under Healthy Ireland to tackle the stigma of HIV and to reduce the numbers.  The rates for this year are on a par with previous years and there is a worry about the trends.  Our focus must be on achieving the goals and on maintaining funding.  As a country we have signed up to Fast-Track Cities, the global partnership with the 90-90-90 outlook and outcome, and we all must be committed to making testing easier, to know our status while community testing must be made available, awareness raised, and the stigma that still exists in the context of HIV reduced.<\/p> <p>In the context of Cork, I pay tribute to the staff and leadership of the Sexual Health Centre who are doing Trojan work during this pandemic with the outreach, support programme and counselling that has been available.  Their HIV sexually transmitted infection, STI, clinic has been open throughout the pandemic.  It is a facility and service available to people and the clinic must be commended on this.<\/p> <p>Our urban centres may not be an issue - Senator Warfield will have a Commencement matter on a particular issue shortly - but visibility in rural settings is one that needs to be addressed as to equity of service, and availability and access to services.  I was asked by somebody whether an eircode was the decisive feature in access to service.  I certainly hope that it is not.<\/p> <p>I also commend HIV Ireland, which has been to the forefront in our battle and response to HIV and AIDS for more than four decades.  In reflecting, as many of us do, and remembering our many friends we have lost, we recognise today that we are in a better place as a country because in the furtive early years, a social policy was being led and changed by NGOs and activists.  Today, this is now Government-led.  That is why the red ribbon, the symbol of HIV-AIDS awareness, is one that we should be proud to wear.  I thank the Minister of State for being present and I look forward to his response.  Our journey continues and I am very proud to see that he is present to wear the jersey in this battle and quest.  I genuinely believe that we are lucky to have him as Minister of State as I know him a long time as a person with a genuine commitment to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#M00600","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his remarks.  The national AIDS strategy referred to by the Senator was published in 2000.  Its most recent successor is the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020, published in 2015.  That strategy aims to improve the sexual health and well-being of the population and to reduce negative sexual health outcomes, including unplanned pregnancies and the transmission of STIs, including HIV.  These aims are being addressed by the delivery of a programme of work to improve education and prevention supports, sexual health and STI services, and the quality of health information used to inform policy.  The vision of the sexual health strategy is \"that everyone in Ireland experiences positive sexual health and wellbeing\".  The strategy has three goals: that everyone living in Ireland will receive comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education and\/or information and will have access to appropriate prevention and promotion services; that sexual health services, which are equitable, accessible and of high quality, will be available to everyone; and that robust and high-quality sexual health information will be generated to underpin policy, practice, service planning and strategic monitoring.<\/p> <p>A mid-term review of the strategy in 2018 found that implementation is going well.  There is a great working relationship between voluntary and community groups working in this area, and the HSE's sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, SHCPP, which manages the health care services covered by the strategy.<\/p> <p>Tackling the recent increase in new diagnoses of HIV and other STIs is a key element of the strategy.  Last year saw the launch of a number of major actions to combat these rising rates of infection.  In June 2019, Ireland formally became a member of the HIV Fast-Track Cities initiative, a major global partnership committed to accelerating local HIV-AIDS responses.  Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway have joined this network, and &euro;450,000 in funding was provided in 2019 for implementation of local actions, such as increased access to HIV testing.  The most significant development in 2019 was the introduction of a national programme of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which involves the pre-emptive use of anti-retroviral medication to prevent HIV infection.<\/p> <p>PrEP is provided within a holistic prevention service which includes regular monitoring and testing, as well as advice and counselling on safer sex practices.  Funding of &euro;5.4 million was provided in 2020 to provide for a full national roll-out of PrEP and to fund additional staff and other resources required to provide HIV PrEP within a broader sexual health and HIV prevention programme.<\/p> <p>Other important actions undertaken by the SHCPP includes support for parents, with a range of booklets having been published recently to enable them to talk to their children about relationships, sexuality and growing up.  The SHCPP also provided support for the provision of relationship and sexuality education in schools.  The programme plays a vital role in developing research, collaborating with, for example, the ESRI, to produce the evidence-based information that is vital to understanding emerging trends.  The future direction of the strategy will be reviewed in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#M00700","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach and the Minister of State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we live up to our expectations around fast-track cities, that there is a combined collaborative approach and that we continue to be to the forefront in responding to HIV and AIDS.  <\/p><p>The funding of &euro;450,000 announced last summer needs to be matched in future years.

I feel like we have a weekly date to discuss things.<\/p> <p>It probably goes without saying that this year has been an extremely difficult and trying time for everybody in the country, but none more so than our front-line workers, in particular those working in the healthcare system, including our doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners and healthcare assistants.  It has been tough for them and in uncertain circumstances they have stepped up to stop the pandemic in its tracks, help and mind Irish people and ensure our hospitals were not overrun, as unfortunately happened in many other European countries.<\/p> <p>Student nurses in many of our hospitals continue to be a vital additional resource for management when workloads increased.  The Department of Health correctly opened the temporary healthcare assistant salary to student nurses who carried out the duties, and, more important, had the responsibilities, of looking after our fellow citizens, responsibilities that would never have been placed on them in any other normal year.<\/p> <p>For a student nurse studying for a four-year degree, 45 weeks of placement are required.  While the four-year internship programme and placement are paid, students in first, second and third years are unpaid.  In the past week or so, different commentators and the Minister have tried to justify the receipt of travel or accommodation allowances, but at the very best that payment might equal &euro;50 per week.  At the very worst, a young woman in my constituency detailed that she gets &euro;7 per week in travel allowance.  That would not cover her bus fare from Ratoath to the hospital she is working in.  Significant asks have been made of student nurses this year, and they are not going away and probably will not go away until we have a widespread vaccination programme which will come, please God, next year.<\/p> <p>Gaining a qualification in nursing is a daunting enough task at the best of times.  Doing a placement in the middle of a global pandemic with many incredibly worrying and overwhelming challenges ahead of them means that we need to show we value the students and the work they do.  To do that, we need to compensate them.  We need to recognise, through money, our support for student nurses and the work they do.  A round of applause would only go so far. <\/p> <p>I welcome the recent soundings from the Minister and Department of Health on reviewing student allowances in the longer term.  That the Minister is considering those proposals means that will not help students on a placement this year.  Students who have been on those placements from September until Christmas will be expected to come back in January when we know the normal onslaught on the health service will put them in a further invidious and unenviable position. <\/p> <p>It is time for us to stand up as a State and recognise once and for all, not at some future date but today, the hard work, commitment and dedication to the delivery of good public services and health services shown by our first, second, third and fourth year student nurses, and make an announcement before Christmas that we will look after them financially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#N00400","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Doherty for raising this important issue.

This supernumerary status is critical for learning in complex environments.  Financial supports for non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by Circular 9\/2004 which provides for an accommodation allowance of up to &euro;50.79 per week to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from his or her normal place of residence and a refund of travel expenses.  Both are paid as refunds on production of receipts.<\/p> <p>Concerning fourth year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE continues to fund the internship employment of these students who are on rostered work placements.  This includes those due to commence rostered work placements in January 2021.  These student nurses and midwives on rostered work placement are paid at the approved rate, that is, &euro;22,229 on an annual basis for psychiatric nursing specialism and &euro;21,749 for all other nursing disciplines and midwifery.  These rates of pay are determined by HSE Circular 005\/2016 and are the updated rates in accordance with the consolidated pay scales with effect from 1 October 2020.<\/p> <p>In the immediate term, my Department reviewed a number of supports that applied to this year's supernumerary students which includes first, second and third  year students and fourth  year students from the period of September to December on clinical placements, taking into account the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on such placements.<\/p> <p>Other supports available in 2020 for student nurses and midwives include access to the pandemic unemployment payment for those students who may have lost part-time employment due to Covid-19; enhanced Illness benefit for those students who work part-time but have fallen ill with Covid-19; other welfare schemes to assist with financial hardship due to illness, subject to qualifying criteria, for example, the supplementary welfare allowance and the urgent needs payment; access for eligible students to the national access plan contingency fund and the student assistance fund; and a &euro;250 top-up for those in receipt of the Student Universal Student Ireland, SUSI, grant or a &euro;250 contribution to fees to eligible students.

However, the Gay Mens Health Service, GMHS, is the only sexual health service which has not reopened.  The sexual health services which are open are oversubscribed.

The conclusion of the withdrawal agreement meant that many provisions of the 2019 Act could not be commenced.  Ireland strongly welcomes the certainty the withdrawal agreement brings.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement.  It avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, ensures that trade and goods will continue to flow freely on this island and ensures access for Northern Irish goods to the EU Single Market.<\/p> <p>It is incumbent on all parties to ensure that the provisions of the withdrawal agreement and protocols, which were agreed less than a year ago, are applied in full.  The withdrawal agreement provides structures for handling issues with the implementation of the protocol.  These are the only appropriate way to deal with the outstanding questions.  It is welcome that face-to-face talks continue in London.  Ireland continues to support Michel Barnier and the task force in their work on concluding an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The time to reach an agreement is very short but a deal cannot come at any price.  To get a deal, there will have to be compromises on both sides.  The EU approach has been very consistent: there must be a level playing field for open and fair competition for our businesses, and a fair and balanced outcome on negotiations relating to fisheries.  We have also been clear that any requirement requires the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement.  I am in ongoing contact with Michel Barnier and Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, who is the EU co-chair of the joint committee overseeing the implementation of the protocol.  Both remain acutely aware of our positions, I can assure the House of that.<\/p> <p>Even if a deal is concluded, however, the end of the transition period will bring significant and lasting change for citizens and businesses.  From 1 January, the UK will no longer apply EU law, which will significantly change the way in which the EU and the UK engage into the future.  We used the transition period to recalibrate and refine the readiness work carried out ahead of the possible no-deal Brexit in March and October 2019 and in January 2020.  In September, the Government launched its Brexit readiness action plan, which sets out the actions the Government will take, and that businesses and citizens must also take, to address the changes arising at the end of the transition period.  Probably the most significant of these changes will be the UK moving outside the Single Market and the customs union.  This means new controls and procedures must be applied to any goods moving to, from or through Great Britain, processes that do not apply today.  Perhaps the clearest example of what this means is that Revenue estimates that import and export declarations could increase from 1.7 million a year to 20 million a year next year.<\/p> <p>The action plan has been accompanied by an intensified programme of trader engagement.  Since it was launched, more than 50 separate ministerial engagements have dealt with Brexit.  These were supported by a range of official meetings and briefings.  We are using a multitude of virtual tools, from webinars to instructional videos, to assist businesses in preparing for the new realities they will face next year.  The T&aacute;naiste has sent a Brexit readiness checklist to 225,000 businesses registered in Ireland.  Revenue, separately, has written to more than 90,000 businesses trading with the UK and followed up with more than 14,000 phone calls.  We have made a range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports available to businesses.  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;340 million to Brexit-related measures.  In response to a specific demand from industry, the July jobs stimulus package included a &euro;20 million ready-for-customs package to assist with hiring and training staff in the customs area, where so much work will be involved in getting ready.<\/p> <p>Preparations in our ports and airports are also well advanced.  In addition to the new infrastructure, we have invested in new staff and ICT systems.  Some 1,500 additional staff will be engaged in supporting and carrying customs, sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, and food safety checks and controls.  In Dublin Port alone, we have spent more than &euro;30 million to date on physical infrastructure, preparing for the new realities.  We are working closely with the European Commission to ensure that the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve will target the sectors and member states most disproportionately impacted by Brexit, and that certainly includes Ireland.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware of the complex issues that will arise for citizens and businesses post transition.  The Government's readiness approach comprises a range of policy and economic responses and targeted Brexit-related resources.  Primary legislation is again required to support a number of these measures.  As was the case last year, an omnibus Bill is considered the most effective mechanism to address the legislative needs.  The 2020 Brexit omnibus Bill before the House contains 22 Parts under the remit of 11 Ministers, and I am again the overall sponsoring Minister for this legislation.  While similar to the 2019 Act, this Bill has a different point of departure.  The 2019 Act catered primarily for the possibility of a disorderly UK withdrawal from the EU, whereas this Bill deals with the permanent changes that will take effect from 1 January 2021.  We have a deal on Brexit that has facilitated the exit of the UK from the EU; we do not have a future relationship or a trade agreement that can manage that future relationship.<\/p> <p>This is a diverse Bill, but its overarching purpose is to protect citizens, consumers and businesses.  It aims to reduce the possibility of serious economic disturbance and to facilitate the sound functioning of a number of key sectors.  Equally important, it is also contains a number of provisions that support aspects of the common travel area, CTA, and North-South co-operation.  Protecting citizens, North and South, is at the heart of the Bill.  It makes provision in very important areas as varied as student grants, social welfare payments, divorce arrangements, cross-Border bus services, defamation and the national childcare scheme.  It will protect employees in Ireland if their employers become insolvent under UK law.  A number of provisions also seek to protect and maintain the common travel area and broader UK-Ireland relations.  It will support ongoing co-operation in healthcare between the UK and Ireland.  Furthermore, in case access to the European health insurance card, EHIC, programme is not addressed in any future partnership agreement, Part 3 of the Bill will provide for the introduction of an EHIC-like scheme for people in Northern Ireland.  Parts 16 to 18, inclusive, deal with a range of justice and immigration issues, including provisions for extradition on the basis of the 1957 Council of Europe convention, exempting UK citizens from passport checks within the CTA and the designation of safe third countries for the purposes of returns of applicants for international protection whose applications are deemed inadmissible and where appropriate safeguards are in place, in line with international law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We are keenly aware of the impact the end of the transition period will have on businesses.  Several parts of the Bill seek to minimise disruption to our economy and business sector.  Part 8 includes a number of measures in respect of taxation that will allow businesses and citizens to continue to access measures and reliefs as today in areas such as income tax, capital gains tax, corporation tax and stamp duty.  Specific anti-avoidance provisions are also included.<\/p><p>The Bill includes provisions to introduce postponed accounting of VAT to alleviate potential cash flow issues by allowing businesses trading with the UK extra time to make their VAT returns.  This measure has been requested by a number of business representative bodies.  Changes will also be made to the operation of the VAT retail export scheme.  In response to requests to consider the threshold for the scheme, the Government amendment at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il reduced that threshold from &euro;175 to &euro;75.  That was a particular ask from Opposition parties and was a concern raised within Government as well.  I hope that reduction of the threshold will be welcomed.<\/p><p>There was confusion in the D&aacute;il debate regarding an amendment that the Labour Party tabled in Deputy Howlin's name, which was supported by Sinn F&eacute;in, seeking a review of that measure in a year's time to see how it is working.  That amendment was not accepted but there is a commitment from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to carry out that review.  I reassure Senators that the Government will undertake that review over the next 12 months to see how that is impacting on the retail sector, trading and so on.  I give that commitment on the floor of the House because it will be difficult for the Government to accept any amendments at this point without having to go back to the D&aacute;il.  Unless there is something really exceptional, it will be difficult for me or other Ministers to accept amendments.  That was the only amendment there was any real disagreement on in the D&aacute;il and the Minister for Finance has given a commitment to doing that review.  Hopefully, that will allay concerns as we move to Committee and Report Stages on Thursday.<\/p><p>Part 11 makes a number of amendments to the Customs Act to support the operation of the customs online roll-on roll-off service.  This new service will be required to handle a substantial increase in non-EU trade from the end of the transition period, coming from the UK.<\/p><p>The Bill also deals with issues relating to existing insurance contracts, settlement systems for financial services contracts and the employment permit scheme.  It contains provisions on technical issues relating to professional qualifications in specialized fields such as fluorinated greenhouse gases and harbour pilotage services, as well as for market surveillance in the field of construction products.  This is trying to ensure that we anticipate trade disruption as best we can and legislate for it where we can and where we have a national competence, rather than an EU directive.  The provisions in the Bill will be complemented by a number of measures in secondary legislation, that is, ministerial orders, which will also be adopted before the end of the year.<\/p><p>In 30 days' time, many aspects of our relationship with the UK will change fundamentally and permanently.  Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, we remain strongly committed to protecting and strengthening the relationship with our closest neighbour.  Our immediate priority, however, is to prepare for the changes that will arise on 1 January.  This includes passing all Stages of the Bill in a timely fashion to be ready for enactment and commencements before 31 December.  After Second Stage today, Committee and Remaining Stages will take place this week on Thursday.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will be here for the debate because I need to be in Paris on Thursday.<\/p><p>I want to thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators for their co-operation in facilitating the passage of this Bill and the timetable that we have asked them to accommodate.  I thank them also for their co-operation, assistance and support throughout the Brexit process to date.  I remember bringing a similar piece of legislation to this House in 2019 and got extraordinary co-operation and we had a good discussion and debate on it.  I ask for that co-operation again.  This is important stuff and 1 January is going to bring about some fundamental change and disruption, for which we need to be as prepared as we possibly can.  We owe that to citizens, businesses, consumers and to many people that effectively are stakeholders in the British-Irish relationship in terms of the business that they do, the family circumstances that they have and many other relationships that will be affected by the end of transition at the close of the year.  I thank Senators for their co-operation and I hope I can continue to rely on it as we conclude the debate on the legislation this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#Q00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge his personal commitment to getting this right and the skill he has brought to that.  In these elected assemblies of the Oireachtas, we can sometimes allow the negativity from outside to impact on us and sometimes become unwittingly and wrongly self-critical because of it.  We should be collectively very proud that one of the great achievements of our political system, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government of the day has been the way we have dealt with the Brexit challenge and its potential to damage our country and our relationship with the UK and to cause huge economic and social dislocation and many problems.  It is a success for Government in the way it was handled but it is also a success for the entire Oireachtas in the way that there was a co-operative spirit and a willingness to work together to achieve that outcome.  We should take collective pride in that.  It has been one of the great successes.  When we are confronted with negativity, as we often are and to which we often allow ourselves wrongly to succumb, we should hold our shoulders high and stand tall and proud of what we have done.  It is one of the great successes of contemporary times.  It had enormous potential to destroy us on so many fronts and still presents huge challenges, obviously.<\/p> <p>As the Minister stated, the omnibus legislation from last year put in place contingency measures to address issues that would arise if there had been no deal.  Since then, we have had the withdrawal agreement and the protocols on Ireland, all of which brings about the avoiding of a hard border, which is the success I alluded to earlier.  It allows access for Northern Ireland goods to the Single Market.  The UK Internal Market Bill offends and challenges that but we have to hope and work to ensure that sanity will prevail in the end.  Let us pray that we have an agreement.  I am confident that we will have an agreement on the premise that self-interest on both sides of the Irish Sea dictates the need for an agreement.  The results of a non-agreement have huge negative economic implications for the UK, as they have for this country.  That collective self-interest will have to prevail.  Our self-interest is being negotiated by the EU team and the UK are negotiating their own self-interest.  Sanity will have to prevail.  I know from reading about it and informally chatting to the Minister as we entered the Chamber that fishing remains a very big issue.  It is big for this country but we have to pray that a compromise will be reached.  The Government is preparing for two scenarios, that is, a limited agreement and a hard Brexit.  A total free trade agreement with everything agreed would be the optimum outcome but it may be more limited.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->New controls and procedures will be necessary.  A good deal of preparatory work has been done, all of which has been detailed by the Minister, but it is being supported strongly by the Government with the &euro;20 million in the July jobs stimulus package and the budget 2021 commitment in excess of &euro;300 million.  There are 1,500 additional staff at airports and ports, which is a significant change and investment.<br\/><br\/>The omnibus Bill, which I am proud to support and hope, as the Minister does, will receive the support of the House on patriotic grounds, has 21 Parts.  The withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Ireland already deal with many of the issues but the fundamental purpose of the Bill is to protect our citizens, consumers and businesses, reduce the possibility of serious economic consequences and look after key sectors.  The Bill will allow for co-operation in healthcare between Ireland and the UK, which is very important, and in terms of student mobility, which is welcome.  I have many examples of that, which all Members could cite, such as the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants to students studying in the UK and UK students studying here.  Social welfare is important because many emigrants who have returned from the UK are on social welfare payments and many citizens in the UK are on various social welfare payments so a continuity in that regard is crucial, as well as reciprocity.  That is achieved by the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The insolvency issue is important for workers here because many people go abroad for insolvency purposes.  Mutual recognition in the annulments and divorce area is very important.  The childcare provisions and the taxation measures set out are important also.  It is welcome that we have the extra time to make VAT returns.  The support for the customs online service and the cross-border bus services is welcome also.<br\/><br\/>I would like the Minister to respond on the fear around congestion.  Before I came into the House, I read some newspaper extracts from recent weeks.  One of the issues cited in newspaper articles is the risk of congestion at our ports.  At present, 6,000 heavy vehicles go through Dublin Port every day.  At peak times in the morning, 400 heavy vehicles go through the port tunnel.  That has the potential for major congestion and the possible back-up of traffic to the M50.  Assurances from the Minister on that in his concluding remarks in terms of a strategy to deal with it would be appreciated.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to respond to another issue I came across as I read a few articles before coming into the House for the debate.  It is the risk to the existing health arrangements whereby the now famous buses bring people to the North for various surgeries under the cross-border healthcare initiative.  It has been a very successful scheme and I would be interested to know whether there is a threat to that.  If so, are there contingency plans in place and what assurances can he give in that respect?<br\/><br\/>All of us are conscious of the famous fish and chips issue that came up last night and the threat to Irish chips.  One could look at that in a light-hearted fashion but it is indicative of the level of interaction, threat and danger the entire Brexit process brings and its potential to cause upheaval here.  That is a serious issue also, certainly for that sector.<br\/><br\/>I am delighted that the Bill sets out to protect our citizenry to the maximum degree possible, in other words, to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>to the greatest degree possible and to avoid threats.  There were existential threats at the outset to agriculture, food and the Border community.  I could go on about that.  Senator Craughwell, who is present, and I were on the previous Brexit committee together and we invited in all the sectoral interests at that time for meetings.  That was a previous special committee and the next one will get under way under Senator Chambers.  I look forward to working with that committee.  All the issues arising in this debate will arise in that forum also.  At the committee of which Senator Craughwell and I were members, the sectoral interests appeared and outlined their troubles.  Effectively, it was a type of Armageddon in its worst form.  That is the reason this Bill is so important.<br\/><br\/>There is not much more to be said other than that I am enthusiastic about the Bill.  I look forward to the Minister's response to the few issues I raised.  I am glad that we are putting money and staff into this project to try to make it work.  We have to hope.  As I have done in many instances at the Council of Europe and through informal contact with members of the UK delegation, we should appeal from this Chamber to our friends in the UK to please do a deal on this one and try to maintain normality, not only for us but for their own citizenry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#R00200","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I believe this is the first time I have met him in this House as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Ordinarily, I would be screaming to the high heavens as we try to rush Bills through the House but I fully understand where the Minister is coming from on this one.  At the outset, I wish to pay him a compliment personally.  Every time we have hit a bump in the road, he has been available to the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky News.  He has been steadfast in his support for Ireland, the Republic and Ireland, Northern Ireland.  He has worked with everybody to keep this ship on the road and I compliment him on that.  In doing so, I also wish to compliment Michel Barnier, whose ear the Minister clearly has, as Ireland's interests are at the centre of everything he tries to do.  I was most impressed by him on this issue the first time I met him about four years ago and he has remained steadfast with the Minister all of the way.  The Minister is to be complimented on everything he has done on this issue.  I would not say that about everything he does but in this particular case, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he has stood for Ireland and he will be remembered for years to come.<\/p> <p>I want to thank the Minister's officials also.  The omnibus Bill that is before the House involved a massive amount of work.  It is highly technical and there are more Bills to come.  His officials have been doing what they do best for Ireland.  Sometimes, we overlook the fact that civil servants work late into the evening to get things right.  Civil servants advise Ministers and we see that even at this Stage, as the Minister is willing to listen to the Opposition with respect to a small change that needs to be made to the Bill.  I want to compliment the Minister on that.<\/p> <p>My main concern is about Part 11 of the Bill on the customs arrangements and how it will deal with the massive increase in customs controls that will be required at ports and traders' premises arising from the end of the transition period on 31 December.  Skillnet Ireland, local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland have been running courses for Irish companies to help them manage the new regime.  However, I am aware that agents responsible for processing customs declaration forms are very concerned that the small and medium-sized companies are not ready to cope with the volume of import and export declarations that will be required.  Last week, the Taoiseach said that we will go from customs declarations of approximately 1.5 million to 20 million per annum and he urged Irish exporters to do their paperwork in advance.  That is a monumental leap for even the most efficient and well-prepared companies, given the scale of the plans the Government has in place to help deal with that.  The UK has decided to offer a six-month deferral of Brexit customs declarations until 30 June 2021.  I believe a corresponding deferral on this island, although I appreciate that may be difficult with our EU partners, would assist us in getting over the hill, so to speak.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Could the Minister confirm exactly how many have been taken on and trained with respect to dealing with the future problems?<\/p><p>As the Minister probably knows, I am the convener of the German-Irish parliamentary friendship group.  I have been the convener for the past four years and I am delighted to be convener again.  Yesterday, the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce celebrated its 40th anniversary in Ireland.  The Germans have been particularly helpful in supporting Ireland all the way through the negotiations.  There are, however, a number of concerns that the Germans and I share.<\/p><p>I compliment Wexford County Council and Rosslare Harbour, which have laid on facilities for customs checking.  One of the facilities is slightly outside the town of Rosslare but I believe that will be managed.  While I see the preparations in Rosslare, I am not so sure that there are similar preparations in the UK.  My colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly, just referred to the issue of congestion.  When I see the backlog of trucks running for several miles, particularly at Dover, I become somewhat concerned.  In the previous Seanad, one of my colleagues told me it would not be a problem and that the British would lay on a single carriageway for Irish trucks to go from Pembroke straight down to Dover and then straight across the channel, and that they would not be stopped.  Let us face it: we know that is not going to happen.  Perishable goods comprise the big issue if using the land bridge.  I am aware that the sea bridge has started to open up.  I was delighted to see last week the opening of the new service to Dunkirk, which is a bit of an irony in itself.  We need to get farther into Europe, probably up into Duisburg or the Hook of Holland.  I wonder what plans exist to support additional deep-sea vessels, even though we understand that the deep-sea vessels that will be travelling will take considerably longer to make their journeys.<\/p><p>My next point, on the exploitation of future opportunities, particularly in mainland Europe, is probably not related to the Bill.  We have been reliant on Britain for many years with respect to activities such as drug importation.  It would be great if we could move to a German or French supplier in this regard.  It would be great to determine what opportunities exist.  When I was in Germany last year, we were examining Irish trade with Germany.  There are significant parts of Germany in which we do not currently trade.  The Minister has been working on that, as has his Department.  I see great opportunities.<\/p><p>Ultimately, we have to turn Brexit into an opportunity, North and South, for Ireland to box above its weight in Europe.  We are lucky Europe is prepared to support a peripheral island like ours.<\/p><p>I am not sure what the position is on fisheries today but fisheries have been a major concern for Irish fishermen who fish off the Donegal and east coasts and, I am sure, off the Galway coast.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us a little bit of information on this.<\/p><p>I am not going to waste any more of the Minister's time.  He has done a sterling job.  I look forward, with some excitement, to how we are going to exploit the opportunities available owing to Brexit.  Senator Chambers, as Chairman of the new Brexit committee, will examine these issues as the committee sits.  We could not have a stronger person in place.  I congratulate her on her appointment to the committee as Chairman.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House today.  I will not be doing anything to obstruct his Bill as it goes through.

I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I am sure he will find cross-party support in this House for the Bill, as on the last occasion.  It is rare that an issue unites all parties across the Oireachtas, but this is one of them.  It is a testament to the strong and resilient Parliament we have and to the fact that Members of all parties and none ultimately have the best interests of the Irish people at heart.  That is borne out when it comes to Brexit.<\/p> <p>Four weeks from Friday next, the UK will exit the transition period and finally be outside the EU's Single Market and customs union.  From 1 January, how we trade with the UK will be dramatically different.  Even if a free trade agreement is concluded between the EU and UK, there will, of course, be significant and lasting change.  It is vital that all businesses focus on Brexit preparedness as circumstances will not stay the same and as we move into the final stages.<\/p> <p>The principal aim of this wide-ranging Bill is to tackle the range of complex issues that may arise for our citizens and businesses after the transition period.  This legislation is part of the Government's work to prepare Ireland for Brexit.  It will seek to protect our citizens and consumers as much as possible and reduce the possibility of a serious disruption to our economy.  I hope it will ensure Irish businesses are not affected too severely.<\/p> <p>The negotiations on the EU-UK future trade agreement have really been stepped up in intensity since 21 October, with negotiating teams on both sides working almost daily.  Credit is due to the teams on both sides for their work in this regard.  We hear a lot of talk about landing zones.  We really hope they find those zones in the coming days.<\/p> <p>The key issues remain.  They include: the level playing field provisions to ensure fair competition; governance; and fisheries.  The issue of fisheries is of key national interest to Ireland.  Any deal must involve compromise on both sides, as we all accept, but it must not be at any cost .  We must maintain the integrity of the Single Market and protect the Good Friday Agreement.  Importantly, the deal done must, on the face of it and in its detail, be just and fair to all involved.  As has been said from the beginning, there can be no cherry-picking of the Single Market, and it cannot be better to be outside the club than in it.<\/p> <p>Mr. Michel Barnier has been fundamental to the unified and consistent approach of the EU 27 throughout the Brexit process, including at its most critical moments.  As a country, we thank him and his team for their work.  It is important to acknowledge the steadfast and unwavering support and solidarity of our EU partners.  Other member states have stood squarely behind Ireland and have demonstrated, throughout the Brexit process, that they recognise the unique ways in which Ireland, North and South, is affected by Brexit.  I believe strongly that this very clear and explicit display of support from other EU member states is crucial to the longevity and survival of the EU.  It is a show that support and loyalty that members can expect from other member states, even if small.  This is important at a time when the geopolitical landscape is particularly challenging for the EU and we are dealing with the considerable blow that Brexit has dealt us.  As a union, we needed to come out strong and united.  We have done that, much to the dismay and disbelief of others.  Regardless of the outcome of the talks, we expect the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Northern Ireland.  This remains a key concern for Ireland, given recent legislative proposals brought forward by the UK Government that directly sought to undermine that agreement and provoke mistrust.  It is important that we continue to remind the UK that the agreement is a legally binding international agreement and that no part of it is optional.  The UK must fulfil its obligations, to which it willingly signed up.  The protocol on Northern Ireland is explicitly designed to operate regardless of whether an EU-UK future relationship agreement is in place.<\/p> <p>As we approach the end of the transition period, there are still many unknowns.  We have seen fishing rights come to the fore in recent months.  This issue remains a key sticking point that is potentially blocking the ratification of a deal.  The Taoiseach has said he believes a practical, commonsense approach is required to finalise agreement.  He said, \"I have pointed out to [the] British prime minister this idea of dividing lines across the seas and saying, 'this is our fish and that's your fish' &ndash; I mean, the seas don't operate like that.\"  We are aware that many fish spawn in Irish waters and are caught at their most valuable stage after migrating north to UK waters.  The Taoiseach is of the view that Britain and Ireland share those fish stocks and that we have to be sensible about it.  I certainly agree with that position.<\/p> <p>There is also concern over small businesses' level of preparedness for Brexit and the flood of new customs declarations required for shipping goods to, from and through Britain.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Even with a benign Brexit, there will be very significant change in the level of bureaucracy and businesses have to try their best to prepare for that.  It is important in these final weeks that we get that message out there and help businesses as best we can, each of us, in our communities.  However, I fear there is a level of complacency that things will simply be all right on the night.  This is, in part, because we have had many previous deadlines and cliff edges, where in the end nothing happened.  This time, however, it is a different story.  We will really see significant changes coming into effect from 1 January, even though we are hoping for some flexibility at the borders for the initial weeks.  There will be no more delays this time and the road has to end somewhere.<\/p><p>Things will become very real if no deal is reached.  We see the recent stories of potential sausage wars and not having enough potatoes to supply the chippers in Ireland.  These are the things that exercise people because they impact on their daily lives.  Is there a product on the shelves today that will not be there in the middle of January?  Will it affect supply chains?  Will businesses be able to trade and get goods in and out of the country?  There is an element of waiting to see what might transpire before people fully realise the impact this will have on our country.<\/p><p>Brexit will become a reality and we will deal with it.  On a more positive note, as we come through to the other side of Brexit, we will adapt and things will settle to accommodate the new trading environment.  We will move on.  There are considerable Government supports in place to help ease the burden for businesses, farmers and citizens alike, and we will continually assess how they are working to ensure they remain effective.  I would see it as part of the work programme of the new Seanad Brexit committee that we look, post 1 January, at the supports that are in place to assess whether they are working and fit for purpose, and whether we are, as best we can, supporting our businesses and citizens through this difficult phase.<\/p><p>As a committee, we will also look at alliance building.  We will look to reach out further to the US, to the Scottish Parliament, to Northern Ireland and, of course, to other EU member states.  Most importantly, we will look at what kind of structures we will put in place to maintain that very important relationship with the UK.  I also think it is positive to look at how we have worked together as an Oireachtas on the issue of Brexit.  While there may be times when we challenge one another on how best to do something, the overarching purpose across the board was and is to do all we can to protect Ireland and her interests.<\/p><p>We must now look to a post-Brexit future and immediately go about putting a new structure in place to maintain our close and special relationship with the UK.  Away from the EU institutions and mechanisms that we have come to rely upon, we will need to put in place a new structure for engagement and co-operation between our two Governments.  We should view this as an exciting new chapter in what has been a long, varied and sometimes testing story between our two countries.<\/p><p>I look forward to working with the Minister and the rest of the Government to ensure we get this legislation through the House and that, as the Seanad Brexit committee meets tomorrow with the Minister, we look forward to doing our work in the Upper House to ensure we do our best to protect our citizens, businesses and farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#T00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his considerable work on Brexit and on behalf of the Irish people.  As the Minister confirmed, this Bill involves up to 11 different Departments.  The purpose of the Bill is, of course, to address the many issues that will arise out of Brexit and to do our best, with all our abilities, to try to negate any harm a Brexit deal or, indeed, no deal will do to this country.<\/p> <p>As outlined by my Labour Party colleagues when this Bill came before the D&aacute;il, there are two basic principles that will continue post Brexit and these are underscored in every aspect of this legislation.  The first is the maintenance and continuation of what is known as the common travel area, which has been a feature of relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom since the inception of Ireland as an independent country.  Of course, the term &ldquo;common travel area&rdquo; has so much more importance to our relationship with our nearest neighbours than first inspection of this commonly-used phrase might seem to suggest.  It involves so much more interaction, including the rights to housing and health access, and even the right to vote between our two countries.  It has, I am sure, been a difficult road to incorporate long-standing agreements and relationships into legislation but we feel it has been completed in a positive way that will observe our many obligations to our EU partners and our fellow EU citizens, while, we hope, maintaining that strong relationship that is the common travel area, and our important relationship with our nearest neighbours. <\/p> <p>The second principle is the issue of North-South co-operation, which is fundamental to us all.  It was built upon the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, which must be the cornerstone of our approach to any agreement with the United Kingdom and how we continue to interact with one another, politically, economically and socially.<\/p> <p>As has been said in this debate, it is important to acknowledge the support we have received from our European partners in offering protection and supporting this agreement.  It may have seemed apparent to some, particularly those in the UK, as I said previously in debate in this House, that we would not receive this support, but it has allowed us to formulate a very strong negotiating position.  It is also important at this point to acknowledge the support we have received from the United States, in particular the continued recent support of the President-elect, Joe Biden.<\/p> <p>I want to acknowledge the Minister's acknowledgement of the review of the VAT retail export scheme that he announced today and which Deputy Howlin had brought before him in the D&aacute;il.  It is an amendment we have proposed for the next Stage of the Bill in the Seanad.  I look forward to the Government accepting that amendment, which proposes that we would have a review of this scheme.  Notwithstanding that amendment, like my Labour Party colleagues in the D&aacute;il, I want to raise the proposed provision in the Bill put forward by the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>The Department of Finance has proposed to amend section 58 of the Finance Act 2010 by including a new section, section 64, on page 42 of the Bill before the House.  We feel this is totally unnecessary and it would have an extremely negative effect on an already under-pressure industry.  Following amendments by the Government, this section would raise the minimum expenditure required to qualify for the VAT retail export scheme &mdash; that is, tax free shopping &mdash; from &euro;0, which is the current figure, to &euro;75, with the Government having initially proposed &euro;175.  This means that to qualify for the tax-free rebate as a tourist, one has to spend at least &euro;75.  This will have the greatest impact on small retailers and those that are currently enduring the greatest hardship under the Covid pandemic restrictions.  Small shops and jewellery stores selling Irish jewellery, Irish knitwear and crafts and other Irish products and souvenirs will be the worst hit.  After the enactment of this legislation as now proposed, the minimum requirement will be that tourists who wish to qualify under the scheme will have to spend &euro;75 in these shops.  Recent analysis shows that will exclude 50% of current expenditure in them.  It would be disastrous for them.  I again ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance to examine this proposal.  The ending of tax-free shopping at a time when we are looking for every incentive and assistance to be given to the small and medium-sized traders who need it most is unacceptable and unbelievable.  I wanted to raise that with the Minister and, as I said, we will be coming back to it on Thursday of this week on the next stage of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Following recent conversations with PDFORRA, I also wish to raise a very important matter that has been raised by other colleagues today in regard to the cross-border health directive.  I am sure the Minister is aware, as we all are, of the benefits of this scheme to many citizens but this scheme has had a major benefit for those serving in the Defence Forces.  The PDFORRA medical assistance scheme, known locally as PMAS, was set up by PDFORRA in 2018 due to continued lack of investment and withdrawal of the medical services available to members of the Defence Forces.  PDFORRA set up a separate company, which operates the scheme using the cross-border directive to provide medical treatment to members of PDFORRA for a subscription of &euro;1 per week.  To date, PDFORRA has invested &euro;150,000 into the scheme to support injured members.  Since 2018, the PDFORRA company has sent nearly 200 members to Kingsbridge Hospital, Belfast, for treatment, with more than 100 of those going on to surgery.  This has had a twofold benefit of, first, removing members of the Defence Forces in the scheme from the public waiting lists and, second, allowing serving members to return to work quickly, thereby assisting the Defence Forces in regard to retention, allowing for overseas service and promotion.<\/p> <p>The impact of Covid has created a waiting list of a further 100 members who are awaiting referral.  With Brexit looming and no clarity yet about retention of the EU cross-border health directive in Northern Ireland, this places the PMAS scheme in jeopardy, as any future cross-border treatment scheme will need to be performed on mainland Europe.  It is, of course, the question of the time involved, the language barrier and travel post surgery that makes the benefits of the EU cross-border directive much more attractive in Northern Ireland than travel to other EU countries for the treatment that will remain post Brexit.<\/p> <p>To be fair, the Minister has continually raised this important directive but, given the experience of PDFORRA and the benefits of the directive for the Defence Forces and many other citizens, I ask the Minister to ensure that this directive remains in any post-Brexit agreement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I would also like to raise again the important role the Defence Forces, and the Naval Service in particular, will have in protecting us in any post-Brexit scenario.  We have all read the articles in newspapers in recent weeks about a retention crisis and a continuing manpower crisis in the Naval Service, resulting in a number of ships being delayed in putting to sea because of a shortage of specialist crew members.<\/p><p>As an island nation that is now standing without the back-up of the EU membership of our nearest neighbour, I am sure the Minister will agree this cannot continue.  From a fisheries protection point of view, we recently learned that our Naval Service carried out 1,000 patrol days in 2018 and 2019.  This has fallen to under 600 in 2020.  We simply cannot afford any loss of days.  This would seem to be a worrying figure, given the importance of our fishing industry in negotiations, as other Members have said.  I am sure the Naval Service will have an enhanced role in the new year, protecting our waters from a number of threats.  We must address the continued exit of personnel from the Naval Service, the importance of the job performed by the Naval Service means there must be urgent intervention on behalf of the Government.  The important and additional roles that the Naval Service and the Defence Forces in general will be expected to carry out post Brexit must continue to be urgently considered by the Government.<\/p><p>As a member of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, I look forward to working with Senator Chambers over the coming weeks.  I also look forward to the debate here today and later on in the week.  Unfortunately, this Bill is a result of the UK's exit from the EU.  We have to make provisions for that and make sure we try to ready ourselves and those who will be most affected as best as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#U00200","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire don phl&eacute; seo.  Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite cheana, t&aacute; an Bille seo thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  I thank the Minister for outlining the key aspects of the Bill for us.  Like other colleagues have said, Sinn F&eacute;in has also rightly committed to working with a cross-party approach on this Bill.<\/p> <p>It is vitally important to ensure that Irish interests across our entire island are protected throughout the Brexit process and we must continue to work in unity of purpose to protect the people, North and South, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to protect the Irish protocols.  This approach has been supported by our EU partners, as other colleagues have said, and the Irish interests have been put at the heart of the EU's stance on Brexit.  A lot of that is down to the Minister's work so we are grateful for that.  It has also been heartening to hear figures such as US President-elect Joe Biden show his support and commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  This has taken a great deal of meitheal and support, domestically across the entirety of Ireland, throughout the EU and throughout the world.  Many hands have been involved in ensuring Irish interests were put to and have remained at the fore.<\/p> <p>As the Minister will know, Boris Johnson has consistently been obstructive to the negotiations.  He has deliberately sought to undermine the Good Friday Agreement at times and was even willing to break international law.  Thankfully, the Internal Market Bill was rejected in the British House of Lords but still we see that we must be ever alert.  We cannot be sure but we hope a deal will be done.  It seems the two obstacles to a deal are fisheries and the level playing field and these are still the major stumbling blocks that need to be overcome  Time is running out and the game of brinkmanship being played by the Tories ignores the high stakes for everybody involved, not least for the British themselves.  As always, Ireland will pay a high price for the foolishness of the British Conservatives in the event of a no-deal scenario.<\/p> <p>This Bill helps us to prepare the relevant sections of the economy for Brexit, within the parameters laid out in the withdrawal agreement.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be submitting an amendment on one issue, which is in respect of VAT returns for tourists.  While this issue was debated in the D&aacute;il, I hope the Minister will reconsider his position on it and my colleagues and I will speak to that on later Stages.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, I have campaigned for our people in the North to be able to access the European health insurance card and I welcome the progress and commitments made on this, as outlined by the Minister today and on other occasions.  We must endeavour, however, to create mechanisms that will protect the rights of the people in the Six Counties throughout this process.  As we know, there are approximately 30,000 cross-border workers who live on one side of the Border and work on the other side.  It will be crucial to work with the British Government to establish a frontier workers' scheme to protect the livelihoods of those who cross the Border every day, mostly without even noticing or paying attention to it, until such time as their phones alert them to changes in the mobile service.<\/p> <p>If the Minister has ever believed in a united Ireland and that it was the best way forward, he must see that it makes sense now.  Covid-19 and Brexit are a double whammy for the people of this island.  Both issues have brought to the fore the failures of partition.  All-Ireland approaches make sense.  Despite all good intentions to have an all-Ireland approach to Covid-19, sadly it is clear that the differences in the two systems made and make this difficult.  As I have said many times, Ireland works better when we work together and when we work as one.  It is time for all-inclusive planning and working towards the reunification of our island.  I feel passionately about the injustices of Brexit and partition.  I rapped doors, spoke at press conferences and gave out leaflets in shopping centres and on the street.  Alongside many others, I campaigned against Brexit and to remain.  Ultimately, I also cast a vote to remain.  It is always important to remember at every juncture along this journey that has been forced upon us that there is no consent to Brexit in Ireland and that at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement is the principle of consent.<\/p> <p>This legislation shows that we can prepare for fundamental changes to things that people thought were always to be set in stone.  It shows us that we can manage changes in dynamics and relationships.  I appreciate the Minister's individual work and leadership on the Brexit issue and like other colleagues, I welcome the cross-party support and approach to this important legislation.  It is a crucial time for us and for our country.  I do not need to remind the Minister or my colleagues of that.  It is also a time of great concern, nervousness and trepidation for a lot of people across our economy and society, right down into our communities.  We have done well in the circumstances and we have done the best that we can, given the absolute recklessness, foolhardiness and dangerous nature of the Brexit agenda being forced upon us.  I welcome the legislation.  As I have said, we will work constructively with the Minister, his officials and other groups in this House to ensure that it comes to pass.  In so doing, we then have to ensure that this legislation is effectively enabled and delivered to ensure that people are protected and that Ireland is protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#V00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have not had the opportunity to speak to him ever before.  I have to say I do not always agree with his politics but in this case he is doing stellar work.<\/p> <p>I want to mention a few matters around the SME sector as I am the Green Party spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment.  On 9 September, the Government published the Brexit readiness action plan.  It provides clear and concise advice on steps that need to be taken now by businesses and individuals in order to prepare for the end of the transition period on 31 December.  As of 1 January 2021, the UK will be outside the EU's Single Market and customs union.  This will have significant implications for every business that moves goods to, from or through Great Britain.  All Departments, Government agencies and regulatory bodies are preparing for the end of this transition period.<\/p> <p>I welcome the new measures to help businesses to get ready under the Brexit readiness programme the Government has implemented.  These include a new &euro;20 million ready for customs support scheme.  This financial incentive of up to &euro;9,000 is available through Enterprise Ireland.  Skillnet Ireland has also launched a free online customs training programme called Clear Customs.  The clear message from all of these groups is not to wait but it act now.  For microbusinesses, on 23 November the T&aacute;naiste launched a new Microfinance Ireland Brexit loan scheme of up to &euro;25,000 for those likely to be impacted by Brexit.  Enterprise Ireland is running an online customs insight course.  The local enterprise offices are running a second phase of their successful one-to-one Brexit mentoring and training, called Prepare Your Business for Customs.  Businesses also need longer-term funding for investment purposes and the Government has expanded the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, future growth loan scheme up to &euro;800 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government wrote to all 225,000 businesses through the Companies Registration Office setting out the full range of business, advisory and funding assistance available.  The Taoiseach visited Dublin Port and saw first hand the preparations under way.  It is vital that all businesses that trade with Great Britain or use the land bridge ensure they are ready to complete customs and regulatory declarations from 1 January or are ready to switch to direct sailings.  We know this is an extremely challenging time for businesses across the country.  The Government will continue to provide support and guidance to reduce the impact of Brexit as much as possible. <br\/><br\/>I wish to briefly refer to local enterprise offices.  I have talked to the president, vice-president and some of the CEOs who all agreed that, in fairness to the Government, there has been significant support and expertise available to them but they wished there was more uptake by businesses.  I encourage businesses to visit <i>localenterprise.ie<\/i>and <i>preparingforbrexit.com<\/i>because it would be a shame if businesses did not prepare by availing of information and supports.<br\/><br\/>It is important that we consider our imports from the UK.  A couple of weeks ago, I attended a Teagasc meeting.  One figure that stood out was the volume of animal feedstuffs that are imported from mainland Britain with 56% of our imports based around animal feed.  I hope to speak to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Minister of State who has responsibility for land use about animal feed.  I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as a former Minister for agriculture, will lend his support because the less dependent we are on imports from England, the more resilient we will become as a country.  There is lots of land that is under used here and I would like some of it to be used to create our own Irish animal feeds.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association has done amazing work and provides a one-stop-shop for all small businesses.  It is time now that businesses look at all of the supports that the Government has put in place.  I cannot fault the Government as significant work has been done by all Departments.  For example, two years ago the staff at the ports examined what needed to be done.  That plan has been implemented and the infrastructure is in place, as mentioned by the Minister.

I also thank the officials in his Department and, indeed, other Departments for their work.  We are extremely fortunate in this country to have such quality diplomatic staff and, indeed, public service when dealing with a complex challenge such as this one.<\/p><p>I note colleagues, including Senator Chambers, talked about the unity of purpose in this Chamber and, indeed, across the country in dealing with this matter.  I hope that when the <i>Daily Mail<\/i>or <i>The Express<\/i>come up with their latest story about splits in Ireland, or anywhere else in Europe, that they pay attention to parliamentary debate and understand our unity of purpose.<\/p><p>I support this legislation and, once enacted, I want us to consider the four specific areas: transport, education and research, data privacy and future post-Brexit relations.  On transport, I welcome the comments made by Senator Craughwell when he praised for Rosslare Europort and Wexford County Council for preparing Rosslare.  He will be very much aware that there will be a new direct sailing between Rosslare and Dunkirk.  We need more direct sailings from this island to continental Europe.  It is essential that, as a Government, we work to promote that.  I ask the Minister, given the fact that the volume of freight that will travel through Rosslare will continue to increase, to give serious consideration to ranking Rosslare Europort as a tier 1 port.  That will be essential given it will be the nearest port to continental Europe.<\/p><p>I have a specific concern about airports.  In a post-Brexit scenario, the Boris Johnson Conservative Party, as everyone will know, is not the free market, free trade Conservative Party of Margaret Thatcher.  Has the Government considered what will happen if the UK Government decides to heavily invest in regional airports such as Glasgow, Birmingham or wherever as they will unfairly compete with our airports in Shannon, Cork and, in particular, Dublin?  If the UK Government changes its policy, what preparation has been made regarding air transport?<\/p><p>On data privacy, the UK has agreed, for the moment, to adopt the provisions of the general data protection regulation or GDPR so it has UK GDPR.  In the future, EU decisions on GDPR will not apply to the UK and the UK has the independence to keep the framework under review.  What provisions the Government put in place if decisions on data privacy are made at an EU level, if the UK decides to diverge from that?  We are moving towards tighter regulation on behavioural advertisements or micro-targeting, in addition to algorithmic auditing and content curation.  If there is divergence between EU regulations in this area and what happens in the UK, that will have significant implications in Ireland, particularly as we share data with our nearest neighbour a lot of the time.  What preparations are in place if that happens? <\/p><p>Brexit has caused many problems but in the area of education and research there are major opportunities.  We need to avail of those opportunities and continue our very strong relationships in higher education and research.  We have a common peer review culture, a quality assurance culture and student and staff exchanges, which must be continued.  We must also consider the opportunities that Brexit presents.  Ireland will be a much more attractive country for UK and international academics so we need to develop a programme to attract them here. <\/p><p>It is an enormous pity that the UK has decided to withdraw from the Erasmus+ programme.  Currently, Ireland only sends 3,500 students on the programme every year and 8,000 students come in from continental Europe.Normally, the UK receives 32,000 students from continental Europe.  Ireland will be a very attractive place for those students when they can travel again.  I do not believe that we have given enough thought to the possibilities that will arise as a result of Brexit.<\/p><p>The research budget at European level will be &euro;80 billion although the final figure has not been agreed.  With the UK not taking part, there will be significant opportunities for Ireland.  It is essential that we have people in Brussels but partnering with European universities and other institutions to avail of any opportunities.<\/p><p>I will conclude by discussing our post-Brexit relationships and long-term relationship with the EU.  The Brexit debate forced a very healthy debate to take place in this country and an understanding of the European Union, and the closeness of our relationship.  In an increasingly G2 world dominated by the US and China, we need another strong voice at the table.  I know that the Minister recognises that in the European Union.  We need to redevelop our education programme to highlight the importance of Europe domestically.  We also need to talk about European values, including the rule of law, and we can debate what is happening in Hungary and Poland again.  Having a debate as part of the Brexit process has been important but it should not now stop.  The benefits need to be more effectively communicated domestically and continue the debate about Ireland's part in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120100002#W00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1606818600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being present during this important week.
