","asker":"1487","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>In line with Government advice regarding resuming work at employers&rsquo; premises as COVID related restrictions were relaxed, CSO staff commenced a regime of one day per week on-site attendance at their designated CSO office in September 2021, rising to two days per week in February 2022. These arrangements were communicated as forming part of a &ldquo;transition phase&rdquo; of post-COVID CSO Office attendance, pending finalisation of the civil service Blended Working Framework, published on March 31st 2022, which provided the basis for the development of the CSO&rsquo;s own recently finalised Blended Working Policy. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of extenuating circumstances, a limited number of alternative &ldquo;transition phase&rdquo; attendance arrangements were agreed reflecting specific personal-to-holder considerations, decided on a case-by-case basis.  As with other &ldquo;transition phase&rdquo; arrangements, the latter were clearly identified as being in place pending implementation of the CSO Blended Working Policy. <\/p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s Blended Working Policy attendance model combines time spent working from a designated Home workstation with time spent working on-site from an assigned CSO premises and access to this flexibility is contingent on satisfying a combination of eligibility criteria comprising an assessment of role suitability, person suitability and ergonomic assessment of the available home workspace. <\/p>  <p>  The CSO physical offices will continue to be the primary workplace for all employees as designated during the point of hire, which is consistent with the Civil Service wide policy. Where role, person and ergonomic suitability assessments are deemed satisfactory, the Policy provides that CSO staff may apply to work from a designated home workspace up to a maximum of 60% of weekly rostered hours. This equates to up to three full days in a standard working week for FTEs (pro-rata for work sharers). Final determination of the appropriate level of on-site versus homeworking within the parameters provided for in the Policy rests with section\/team or Divisional Managers and such decisions are taken having regard to meeting the needs of the business.<\/p>  <p>CSO Staff will be given the opportunity to submit their application for Blended Working from mid-September 2022. The Policy will come into effect from November 1st 2022 and all prior attendance arrangements will then lapse. Any staff member not having applied for or not having been approved on application for Blended Working will thereafter be required to attend at the employer&rsquo;s premises on a whole-time basis by default, where this is consistent with their contract of employment. <\/p>  <p>  Blended Working, where made available, is a flexible benefit not an entitlement or a right and is subject to oversight, review and withdrawal at the discretion of line managers having regard to defined eligibility provisions and based on the needs of the business. <\/p>  <p>  CSO HR and Line Managers have been engaging with staff in preparation for the opening of the application process (mid-September 2022). Any staff member with a specific query regarding Blended Working should speak to their line manager in the first instance, and then HR. During the last few months CSO HR have engaged with a number of staff, including the member of staff referred to in this PQ, in relation to concerns regarding Blended Working and has provided advice and guidance to inform staff of options open to them and to support decision making. CSO HR continues to be available to support staff as the Civil Service moves to a Blended Working model. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400059#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400059#WRB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[42836\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400059#WRB01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the totality of grant-aid and or subsidy provided to each local authority in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022 (details supplied).

This will be central to our budget discussions and any new measures to assist businesses will be announced on Budget Day. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working with officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and Environment, Climate and Communications and other relevant Departments to develop proposals to assist all business. A priority is to deliver that assistance as effectively and efficiently as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has already implemented measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of rising energy costs, including a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged, by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil.<\/p>  <p>  There are over 20 other government grants, vouchers and training available to help enterprises reduce their energy bills by reducing their use and becoming more energy efficient.

The Agreement will cement the close political and economic relations between the EU and Mercosur countries and represents a clear commitment from both regions to rules-based international trade.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, Ireland exported nearly &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region. In 2020 &ndash; the most recent year for which figures are available &ndash; Ireland exported approximately &euro;1 billion worth of services to Mercosur. Further expansion into the Mercosur markets is expected as a result of the Agreement reached. The independent impact assessment commissioned by my Department, and published in 2021, concluded that Irish exports to the Mercosur market are expected to be 17% higher in 2035 under the terms of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  However, we also have some well-known concerns regarding climate change and the environmental impact of the extensive forest fire we have seen in the Amazon.

As a small open economy, we support international trade and the EU free trade agreements that seek to underpin this. In that context, I believe that ratifying the agreement would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement has provisionally applied since 21st September 2017, meaning a great many of the benefits are already in place. Since provisional application, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed and goods exports to Canada have increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 36%, while services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.2 billion in 2020, an increase of 38 per cent. These figures demonstrate the positive impact of CETA.<\/p>  <p>  At the Joint Oireachtas Committee last year, I highlighted the benefits of CETA. I also said that, while I welcome the scrutiny at Committee, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other EU member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority have. That would send out the wrong message to the world. The number of EU Member States to ratify the Agreement rose from 15 to 16 in July this year when the Dutch Senate voted in favour of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The ratification process for CETA in Ireland has also been subject to legal challenges. In March last year, Deputy Patrick Costello commenced High Court proceedings on the basis of his view that CETA requires a referendum in order to be ratified in Ireland. The Government very much welcomed the Judgement in those High Court proceedings that issued last September. Deputy Costello has subsequently appealed the High Court&rsquo;s decision to the Supreme Court and judgement is currently awaited. Separately, Senator Lynn Boylan has initiated a High Court action on ratification but a hearing date has not yet been set in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  It remains the position that Government will consider the next steps in Ireland&rsquo;s ratification process once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400060#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400060#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[44422\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400060#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his plans to ensure that the terms of an employment regulation order (details supplied) for the security industry are honoured; the actions that he intends to take to ensure that the terms and conditions of the ERO are implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":59,"content":"<p>On 3 August 2022, I announced my intention to issue an Order to give effect to a statutory recommendation of the Labour Court concerning minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions in the Security Sector.<\/p><p>  The Order was to apply from 29 August 2022.<\/p><p>On 24 August 2022 my Department was informed that the High Court had granted an Injunction prohibiting the commencement of the proposed Statutory Instrument giving effect to the new Employment Regulation Order for the Security Industry.<\/p><p>My officials are in the process of seeking legal advice on the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400060#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[44549\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400060#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will provide an update regarding engagements between the European Union Commission and his Department relating to the mechanism for dispute resolution for European Works Councils and Irish legislation; if the Government has received legal advice on the matter; when the Government will respond to the letter of formal notice European Union Commission of 19 May 2022, which upheld a complaint taken to it by a union (details supplied) on dispute resolutions for a European Working Conditions Survey; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The European Commission wrote to the Irish Government with a letter of formal notice on the 19 May 2022.

The NESF under Response 17, sets out a commitment to develop proposals for regulatory and policy options to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel heating throughout our building stock. This will allow all sectors of the economy adequate time to plan this phase-out, and to give the heat pump industry retrofit sector\u00a0adequate time to scale up capacity. This work is underway and is being led by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to ban replacement boilers in the short term and is aware that this will need to be done in a manner that protects the most vulnerable in society. Fossil fuel heating is the most expensive form of heating which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. CAP21 has signalled that the Government will publish a high level phase-out plan in the next Climate Action Plan. A consultation is currently open on the plan and\u00a0a further public consultation will be completed on any specific heat policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400062#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400062#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[44860\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400062#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide an update on the operation of one-stop shops in relation to the retrofitting scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>Earlier this year, Government announced an enhanced package of measures to support the uptake of home energy upgrades.

The scheme design was supported by detailed economic and policy analysis, as well as a public consultation, prior to its approval in December 2021. Grants are currently available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for domestic installations, up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 and will also be expanded to the non-domestic sector for installations up to 6kW before the end of September. Since the introduction of the MSS domestic grant in February 2022, the SEAI have seen application levels rise sharply and are forecasting the numbers for 2022 to be more than double the application levels seen in 2021, under the previous domestic solar PV grant scheme.

This new set of regulations consists of regulations S.I. No. 672\/2019 - European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Working Hours) Regulations 2019 which are for Irish fishing vessels where at least one fisher on-board is engaged in a contract of employment.

All vessels are subject to a survey every four years and issued with a certificate if found compliant with the requirements. The surveys cover all aspects including crew qualifications, living and working arrangements including hours of work and rest. The MSO carries out its role for all Irish vessels in Ireland and anywhere in the world as well as for all persons on-board irrespective of their nationality, employment status or immigration status. Furthermore, the MSO carries out inspection of foreign flagged fishing vessels when in Irish ports.<\/p>  <p>  The MSO adopts a graduated approach to the rectification of such anomalies and initially seeks that the owner or skipper brings the vessel into compliance. Further action could be to detain the vessel until the issue has been rectified. In a limited number of cases the MSO may initiate a prosecution. The enforcement of the MSO requirements is effective as the licence to fish which is issued by the Sea Fish Licensing Administration of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is based on the vessel complying with the relevant safety regime that is in place for each sector.

While there has been some growth in demand over the summer months and accompanying seasonal capacity constraints, the RSA are confident that current delays within the system will rectify before year end.  <\/p>  <p>  In early 2022, the RSA conducted a review of the current and evolving needs of the driver tester service. This recommended that the number of permanent driver testers employed by the RSA should be raised from 100 to 130. My Department considered the RSA&rsquo;s request and gave its approval in June 2022. This recruitment process is now underway. The RSA hope to see new testers start work in late Autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400064#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400064#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[45065\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400064#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount in financial sanctions that has been imposed on a company (details supplied) for non-delivery of services and unacceptable levels of punctuality in 2021 and to date in 2022; and if he will provide a breakdown by route and the amount of financial sanction that has been imposed.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.

An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. IREFs are required to deduct a 20% withholding tax (&ldquo;IREF WHT&rdquo;) on distributions to non-resident investors.

Certain categories of non-resident investors, such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings, are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place.

Section 865(4) TCA provides that that right is subject to the making of a claim within a statutory limit of four years after the end of the chargeable period to which the claim relates.  That statutory limit is binding on Revenue as well as on taxpayers.  Determinations of the Tax Appeals Commission in differing appellant circumstances confirm that there is no discretion in the application of the four-year rule for claiming repayments.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of this provision there was no statutory right to repayment of tax, though a taxpayer could make a claim for repayment, or could sue for repayment under common law.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s general right to raise assessments or make enquiries in relation to taxpayer returns is also subject to a four-year limit in most cases.  However, as the Deputy states, in certain circumstances - for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules - Revenue's right to raise assessments or make enquiries is not time limited. Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a four-year time limit for Revenue raising assessments and making enquiries and for taxpayers to claim a repayment of tax creates parity between both positions.  An increase in one limit would have to be considered in the context of corresponding increases in other time limits in order to preserve that parity.  <\/p>  <p>  When the four-year time limits were introduced in 2003 the then Minister for Finance stated he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer. I am satisfied that continues to be the position.  I also believe it is appropriate that Revenue should be able to impose interest for late payment and penalties for filing inaccurate returns in cases where a return has been found to be deficient. This is an important dimension of supporting voluntary timely compliance and in ensuring an effective and proportionate response in the context of fraud or neglect or tax avoidance.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the four-year limit in section 865 TCA or to change Revenue&rsquo;s right to raise assessments or make enquiries outside the four-year period, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400064#WRG05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400064#WRG05600"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[44529\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400064#WRG05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rationale for the taxation of social welfare maternity benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>The general rule is that social welfare payments are taxable and exemption from taxation usually occurs only in cases where the payment in question is a mean-tested payment.

The excluded types of dwelling are listed under section 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 Act and include:<\/p><p>- business premises; <\/p><p>- former rent-controlled dwellings occupied by the original tenant or by her or his spouse; <\/p><p>- a dwelling occupied under a shared ownership lease; <\/p><p>- a tenancy where the landlord and tenant share the same self-contained unit; <\/p><p>- a dwelling in which the spouse, parent or child of the landlord is resident and where there is no written lease or tenancy agreement; holiday lettings; or <\/p><p>- a dwelling let by, or to, a public authorities.<\/p><p>Landlords are required to register details of all<b><\/b>their tenancies within one month of the commencement of those tenancies. Revenue have advised that if all the tenancies in a dwelling are not registered for a particular year, all interest relief in respect of that dwelling will be lost for the year. There is no provision for apportionment where only some of the tenancies are registered.<\/p><p>An interest deduction is claimed under the normal self-assessment system. A landlord is required to state in the annual return of income that s\/he has complied with the registration requirements. I am advised that Revenue regards the registration requirements for a chargeable period as met if they are met by the return filing date for that period. Revenue does not require that evidence of registration is submitted with the return of income, but such evidence should be retained for inspection in the event of a compliance intervention by Revenue.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 as amended, I am advised that the RTB supplies Revenue with an annual extract of tenancy information held by the RTB. The data provides details of all tenancies with a commencement date beginning on or subsequent to 1 January 2016. <\/p><p>I am further advised that if a landlord&rsquo;s tax return is selected for a Revenue compliance intervention, written confirmation of the registration of a tenancy from the RTB will be accepted as evidence of compliance with the registration requirements for that tenancy. In the case of an exempt dwelling, the onus will be on the landlord to show that s\/he is not required to comply with the registration requirements. If a landlord has failed to comply with the registration requirements for a chargeable period, any interest relief that has been claimed will be withdrawn. Such a withdrawal of interest relief may result in an underpayment of tax and expose the landlord to interest and penalties.<\/p><p>While new tenancies should be registered within one month of their commencement, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 Act provides for late registration at double the normal registration fee. I am advised that Revenue will accept an acknowledgement from the RTB confirming a late registration as evidence of compliance with the registration requirements provided for in Part 7 of the 2004 Act.  However, a person claiming an interest deduction on their annual tax return must be able to indicate compliance with the Part 7 requirements at the time of making the return. I am also advised that if interest relief has been denied for a chargeable period because a tenancy was not registered by the return filing date, the relief can subsequently be restored if the landlord avails of the late registration facility, subject to the usual four-year time limit on claims for repayment of tax.<\/p><p>Revenue has a legal duty to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information and is obliged to treat personal and business information of all taxpayers in the strictest of confidence.

In the euro area inflation reached a record 9.1 per cent in August. <\/p><p>The pandemic initially had a deflationary impact on the economy. This was followed by an inflationary period as demand out-paced supply during the re-opening phase of many economies.

However, spillover effects from higher energy prices are also being felt in other sectors, such as food (via fertilisers and fuel costs) and consumer goods and services (via higher energy inputs).

The committee is chaired by the Director of Irish at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p><p>The functions of this Committee are set out in the Act and include the preparation of a National Plan, within two years of its establishment, to increase the provision of services through the medium of Irish as well periodic surveying of the number of Irish speakers employed by the public service.  <\/p><p>Some of the actions that my Department and PAS are already taking to increase the number of fluent Irish speakers in the civil service include:<\/p><p><b>-  Dedicated recruitment and promotion competitions targeted at Irish language speakers:<\/b>Since the summer of 2021, PAS has held general civil service competitions for individuals with fluency in Irish at Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer and Principal Officer level.The outturn of these competitions reflects that the number of fluent Irish speakers applying to join the civil service, or otherwise declaring a fluency in Irish, remains low. <\/p><p>I am advised by PAS that since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, a total of 44 candidates have been assigned to date from panels established from recruitment competitions - from Clerical Officer to Principal Officer level - where fluency in Irish was required for the post in question and for which proficiency in Irish was tested as part of the PAS assessment process.  <\/p><p>Additionally, to the end of June 2022 PAS has assigned 101 candidates from competitions to posts where Irish was not identified by the hiring employer as a prerequisite for the post in question and where the candidate declared as part of their application that they had fluency in Irish.  Their proficiency in Irish was not, however, tested as part of the PAS assessment process.<\/p><p>It is possible that some Departments or Government Officers may also have recruited fluent speakers directly under their local recruitment licence instead of PAS.<\/p><p><b>- Irish language training in the Civil Service: <\/b>Along with the recruitment of staff with sufficient Irish language skills, the provision of Irish language training for the Civil Service is of particular importance, in order to enhance the linguistic abilities of current civil servants. OneLearning, the Learning and Development Centre for the Civil Service, was set up in 2017 and is responsible for delivering common training to all Civil Service Bodies (CSBs). <\/p><p>Irish language training courses continue to be made available to all existing Civil Servants via OneLearning - the Learning and Development Centre for the Civil Service based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p><p>Since 2018, 1,454 civil servants have enrolled on an Irish language training course through OneLearning.  470 enrolments of these enrolments were in 2021 and 179 to date in 2022. <\/p><p>OneLearning signed a new contract for the provision of Irish language training in 2021 and is currently rolling out an expanded range of Irish Language training courses that will include the introduction of a Beginner&rsquo;s Irish course, the first term of these courses will commence in September 2022.  The Irish Language courses will be certified by Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge (TEG), which is administered by the Centre for Irish Language at Maynooth University. It is a comprehensive, graded system that allows learners to undertake examinations at five different levels of proficiency. The various levels in TEG are broadly based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching and Assessment (Council of Europe, 2001). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400065#WRH04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400065#WRH04600"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[44448\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400065#WRH04700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Clare who is a retired HSE staff member and who has not had their pension increased or arrears paid in respect of the October 2021 or the February 2022 public service pay increases, will receive their increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the previous Government approved the current pension increase policy as part of its commitments under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA).

In this context, my Department, in collaboration with Civil Service employers, Trade Unions and Staff Associations, has developed a Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the Civil Service and will assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public service. The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework. <\/p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework in March this year.  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs.  In developing their own blended working policies, Departments and Offices have the flexibility to determine matters such as the roles that are suitable for blended working and the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Civil Service is to provide efficient, high-quality services and Departments and Offices must determine how the implementation of blended working arrangements will align with their business needs.  Therefore, access to blended working by civil servants must be dependent on Departments and Offices having the ability to meet the needs of their business.

All public sector bodies will, from September, take a leading role in lowering their energy consumption and costs as a first step in the new Autumn Reduce Your Use energy-efficiency campaign.  This campaign is designed to target reductions in energy use, including, targeted reductions in energy use by public sector bodies, through simple and easy to implement measures such as making more efficient use of buildings where occupancy is low, at certain times, due to remote working.

It underpins a key Programme for Government commitment and it is notable that this coincides with Irish having become a full working language of the EU Institutions since January.<\/p><p>The achievement of an ambitious 20% recruitment target of proficient Irish speakers by 2030 requires a cross-Government approach. The Act provides that within 6 months of the date of enactment, the Minister shall establish an Irish Languages Services Advisory Committee.  Accordingly, Minister Martin and I established this Committee in June of this year. The committee is chaired by the Director of Irish at my Department and has representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service (&quot;PAS&quot;) as provided for under section 18B. (3)(a), (b) and (c) of the Act. <\/p><p>The functions of this Committee are set out in the Act and include the preparation of a National Plan, within two years of its establishment, to increase the provision of services through the medium of Irish as well periodic surveying of the number of Irish speakers employed by the public service.  <\/p><p>To that end, after discussing the various possibilities regarding the approach to the National Plan and the research that could be commissioned for it, the Committee decided at its first meeting on 25 July 2022, that it would issue a Request for Tenders through the open procurement method before the end of August 2022. The Request for Tenders was published by my Department on the  e-tendering platform and in the Official Journal of the European Union supplement (OJ\/S) at the end of last month. The deadline for submitting tenders is 1pm on the 30 September 2022. <\/p><p>It is envisaged that this will be a one-year contract to ensure that the Committee complies with the ambitious deadline set for the preparation of the overall Plan under the Act.  Research priorities will include: <\/p><p>- Identifying the current gaps in the provision of public services through the medium of Irish and making recommendations on how to address these; <\/p><p>- Identifying the public services provided in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas (LPA) and making recommendations as to how to ensure that Irish is the working language of those offices located in each LPA and as to how services for Gaeltacht communities  are to be provided through the medium of Irish; <\/p><p>- Identifying the current level of competence in Irish in the public sector; and <\/p><p>- Making recommendations regarding the recruitment of people with Irish.<\/p><p>It is expected that the measures referred to above, in addition to other new initiatives aimed at promoting Irish speaking roles in the public service, will, over the years leading up to 2030 and beyond, result in increased numbers of applicants for these roles.<\/p><p>Some of the actions that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PAS are already taking to increase the number of fluent Irish speakers in the civil service include <\/p><p> - <b>Dedicated recruitment and promotion competitions targeted at Irish language speakers:<\/b>Since the summer of 2021, PAS has held general civil service competitions for individuals with fluency in Irish at Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer and Principal Officer level.The out-turn of these competitions reflects that the number of fluent Irish speakers applying to join the civil service, or otherwise declaring a fluency in Irish, remains low. <\/p><p>I am advised by PAS that since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, a total of 44 candidates have been assigned from panels established by recruitment competitions - ranging from Clerical Officer to Principal Officer level - where fluency in Irish was required for the post in question and for which proficiency in Irish was tested as part of the PAS assessment process.  <\/p><p>Additionally, up until the end of June 2022, PAS has assigned 101 candidates from competitions to posts where Irish was not identified by the hiring employer as a prerequisite for the post in question and where the candidate declared as part of their application that they had fluency in Irish. Their proficiency in Irish was not, however, tested as part of the PAS assessment process.<\/p><p>It is possible that some Departments or Government Officers may also have recruited fluent speakers directly under their local recruitment licence instead of PAS. <\/p><p>- <b>Irish language training in the civil service: <\/b>Along with the recruitment of staff with sufficient Irish language skills, the provision of Irish language training for the civil service is of particular importance, in order to enhance the linguistic abilities of current civil servants. OneLearning, the Learning and Development Centre for the civil service, was set up in 2017 and is responsible for delivering common training to all Civil Service Bodies (CSBs). <\/p><p>Irish language training courses continue to be made available to all existing civil servants via OneLearning - the Learning and Development Centre for the Civil Service based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p><p>Since 2018, 1,454 civil servants have enrolled on an Irish language training course through OneLearning.  470 enrolments of these enrolments were in 2021 and 179 to date in 2022. <\/p><p>OneLearning signed a new contract for the provision of Irish language training in 2021 and is currently rolling out an expanded range of Irish Language training courses that will include the introduction of a Beginner&rsquo;s Irish course. The first term of these courses is commencing this month.  The Irish Language courses will be certified by Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge (TEG), which is administered by the Centre for Irish Language at Maynooth University. It is a comprehensive, graded system that allows learners to undertake examinations at five different levels of proficiency. The various levels in TEG are broadly based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching and Assessment (Council of Europe, 2001). <\/p><p>It is my expectation that these new measures and others introduced in the years ahead will increase the level and number of Irish medium services available to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400066#WRJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ceisteanna Craolach&aacute;in","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400066#WRJ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[44550\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400066#WRJ03500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; ar intinn aici cead agus maoini&uacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do st&aacute;isi&uacute;in raidi&oacute; do dhaoine &oacute;ga tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus an mbeadh s&eacute; de chead acu craoladh ar ch&oacute;ras FM ar fud an St&aacute;it","asker":"1460","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>&Oacute; 2009 i leith, t&aacute; maoini&uacute; &aacute; thabhairt ag mo Roinn do Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;, st&aacute;isi&uacute;n raidi&oacute; do dhaoine &oacute;ga tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, a chraolann ar an idirl&iacute;on agus ar aipeanna f&oacute;in p&oacute;ca.

Under Action 6 of the strategy for built vernacular heritage, A Living Tradition, which I launched in December 2021, my Department has undertaken to &ldquo;investigate and work to resolve the urgent issue of affordability of insurance for thatched buildings&rdquo; and other relevant issues relating to thatch and thatched buildings. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance is being urgently examined as this has become an acute problem for many owners of thatched properties. A study is under way to examine the issues relating to insurance for thatch and I expect an interim report by the end of this month and a final report by the end of November. As part of the study, officials in my Department have been canvassing thatch owners for their views and experience of securing insurance for their properties. Officials have also consulted with insurance companies and brokers, in Ireland and abroad, fire authorities, and other relevant bodies, to get their assistance in resolving the issue. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the recommendations set out in the report, and any avenues for progress that suggest themselves in the meantime, my Department will work urgently to seek practical solutions to the thatch insurance issue.<\/p>  <p>  I have established a steering group to assist my Department in the implementation actions relating to thatch insurance, and wider actions in relation to thatching skills, thatching materials, and the surveying and recording of thatched buildings. Two members of the group are thatch owners, including a thatcher, another is a thatching grant inspector, and the others have key roles in relevant outside bodies. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to offer a number of financial supports to owners of protected structures, including thatched properties. Under my Department&rsquo;s grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs, there is a grant of up to &euro;3,810 available, where a house is used as a normal place of residence; in the case of medical card holders, the grant can be up to &euro;6,350; and on certain offshore islands the grant can rise to &euro;8,252. <\/p>  <p>  Other streams of grant assistance to thatch owners include the Historic Structures Fund, a stream of which is directed towards vernacular buildings that are not on a local authority record of protected structures, and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme.

Housing for All is a plan with real ambition, guaranteed investment and fresh ideas to deliver housing for real people and create a long-term sustainable housing system. Guaranteed State investment of over &euro;4 billion a year in housing is aimed at increasing supply, which in turn will help increase access to affordable housing to buy or rent.<\/p>  <p>  Housing supply is increasing, despite unprecedented challenges. Since the middle of 2021, over 54,000 new homes have been either built (24,916) or commenced (29,343). Last year, 9,183 social homes were provided.<\/p>  <p>  This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home.<\/p>  <p>  Among the main measures delivered since Housing for All was launched in September 2021 are:<\/p>  <p>  -  A Government budget of &euro;4 billion for investment in housing in 2022, with a further &euro;4 billion committed for 2023. The 2022 budget is an increase of 20% on 2021;<\/p>  <p>  -  The introduction of four affordable purchase initiatives: First Home scheme; a local authority-provided Affordable Purchase scheme; a revised Local Authority Home Loan scheme; the Project Tosaigh scheme by the Land Development Agency;<\/p>  <p>  -  A new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund to address the current viability challenges and activate housing supply at density in city centres through the delivery of 5,000 apartments;<\/p>  <p>  -  The rollout of Cost Rental, a new form of State-backed secure, long-term rental tenure through which rents are aimed at a minimum of 25% below open market rates;<\/p>  <p>  -  Significant funding to assist local authority affordable housing delivery, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). To date, more than 1,000 local authority affordable purchase homes have been approved for funding under the AHF;<\/p>  <p>  -  Further protections for renters including legislation enacted last year that caps any rent increases in a Rent Pressure Zone at 2% per annum pro rata when the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices is higher;<\/p>  <p>  -  To reduce current cost pressures in construction and increase standardisation, the government and the Construction Sector Group have commissioned a study on the cost of construction;<\/p>  <p>  -  The Government also implemented the Inflation Co-Operation Framework, which sees the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary costs on public works contracts;<\/p>  <p>  -  Legislative underpinning to a new requirement that residential houses be ring-fenced for individual buyers &ndash; almost 16,000 units restricted to single purchasers or social and affordable housing by mid-May as a result of restrictions on permissions, with legislative provision incorporated in housing strategies and development plans going forward;<\/p>  <p>  -  To increase supply, legislation introducing a Residential Zoned Land Tax (commencing in 2024 following publication of maps showing land in scope). Coupled with legislation being developed to introduce Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones, these reforms will help (1) activate vacant land zoned and serviced for housing (2) reduce land hoarding that drives up the value of land and cost of housing and (3) ensure greater community gain from land value increases.

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January last for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. Further information on the scheme, including terms and conditions, is available on the dedicated website localauthorityhomeloan.ie\/.<\/p><p>Launched on 7 July this year, the First Home Scheme supports first-time buyers and also applicants under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle. It is being delivered by First Home Scheme DAC, a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders. The Scheme will improve access to newly-built homes on the private market by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. Support of up to 30% of the home value (or 20% if Help to Buy is also utilised) is the maximum available under the scheme. The homes must be priced within regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by first-time buyers in each area, and will therefore support home purchases in the lower region of the market. Further details on this scheme can be found at www.firsthomescheme.ie\/.<\/p><p>The Help to Buy incentive can in its own right can support first-time buyers in obtaining a newly-built house or apartment, or a self-build home. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home.

However, it should be noted that there are limited exemptions allowed to these rules.

The contractor who was awarded the tender agreed to develop the website to the principles of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust, which are the principles of WCAG 2.0.<\/p><p>Specific accessibility-focused user experience testing was conducted by an external agency during August 2018, where five users of different demographics, technical abilities and needs were sourced to test the online platform using screen readers, screen magnification and speech recognition. The testing included persons who are partially sighted, colour blind, have dyslexia and other cognitive issues, and are arthritic. All users were successful in navigating the website and completing the online application process, the reporting noting that the feedback was very positive. The testing was also useful in highlighting some areas for improvement which have since been addressed. <\/p><p>The Passport Service also met with the AsIAm charity during July 2018 where a discussion around the specific needs of persons with autism was held and a demonstration of the Passport Online service was provided.  Feedback from AsIAm was very positive with references to the simple and clear layout and sufficient white space throughout the online process.<\/p><p>As certain application types cover complex areas such as guardianship, the Passport Service places the utmost importance on using plain English throughout the application process. Following a number of internal workshops using the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Customer Communications Toolkit to simplify the language, the Passport Service engaged the National Adult Literary Agency (NALA) who reviewed all screens in the application process and suggested a number of changes to ensure the service is understandable and accessible to all. In 2019, the Passport Service won the National Adult Literary Agency (NALA) award for Plain English for the Passport Online Renewal service. <\/p><p>An external and independent body conducted an Access and Sensory Audit of the Passport Service's public offices in Mount St, Dublin in 2020.<\/p><p>In cases where passport applicants have a medical condition or disability that means that the standard passport photo guidelines cannot be met, the Passport Online service offers a medical indicator option when submitting a digital passport photo.<\/p><p>When applying online, passport applicants or their parents can tick the medical indicator box on the passport photo page. This allows the photo to pass through the system as part of the application process. The passport photo submitted will then be reviewed by a member of the Passport Service staff.<\/p><p>In accordance with section 26 of the Disability Act 2005, my Department has an appointed Access Officer who is responsible for ensuring that help and advice are given to people with disabilities who wish to access our services.<\/p><p>The Access Officer can be contacted through a form on my Department&rsquo;s website, here: www.dfa.ie\/about-us\/contact-us\/contact-access-officer\/ <\/p><p>Alternatively, the Access Officer can be contacted by post at the following address:<\/p><p>Access Officer<\/p><p>Human Resources HQ<\/p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs<\/p><p>76-78 Harcourt Street<\/p><p>Dublin 2<\/p><p>D02 DX45<\/p><p>Customers can also contact my Department's Disability Inquiry Officer via the website (www.dfa.ie\/about-us\/contact-us\/) and their case will be communicated to the Passport Service who can facilitate their request. The Inquiry Officer will investigate any complaints made under Section 38 of the Disability Act.<\/p><p>A member of the public who may require the assistance of an Irish Sign Language Interpreter during an appointment at the Passport Service public office can indicate this when booking their appointment online. A dedicated member of staff will be available to interpret and assist during their appointment.<\/p><p>Passport Customer Service is available Monday to Friday, from 9am to 4:30pm by phone or WebChat on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie\/passports).

Recognising the recurrent nature of drought crises in the region, we are also investing in anticipatory action to mitigate the impact of future shocks. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;33 million in development funding over the last two years to communities across the Horn of Africa, including in partnership with Irish NGOs, to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity and to build community resilience.<\/p><p>I visited Kenya and South Sudan at the end of August, and witnessed first-hand the devastation caused by the drought and the impact of the crisis on vulnerable communities in the region. On 6 September, I announced an additional funding package of &euro;3.2 million to respond to growing needs in the Horn of Africa, including &euro;1.5 million to Irish NGO partners already active in the region delivering life-saving assistance to those most in need and &euro;500,000 to UNICEF responding to child malnutrition.<\/p><p>In addition to direct humanitarian assistance, communities in the Horn are being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which reacts immediately to crises as they happen. Ireland is the eighth largest contributor to CERF, providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated over $302 million for emergency relief across the region.<\/p><p>Ireland is also a consistent advocate for increased support to the Horn of Africa at a global level<b>.<\/b>On 26 April we delivered a statement at the high-level roundtable chaired by the UN and the EU on the drought in the Horn, at which member states pledged $1.3bn to the humanitarian response.

The EU has pledged over &euro;600 million in support of the Horn of Africa.

This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. <\/p>  <p>  School transport is a hugely important service for families.  My Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. <\/p>  <p>  The scope of the review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school.<\/p>  <p>  Following commencement of the review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021, with regard to eligibility and with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  <\/p>  <p>Following consideration of this report, for the 2021\/2022 school year, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  These measures will be continued for the current school year, pending completion of the review and means transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th   July.<\/p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation; including running a public survey for parents\/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. <\/p>  <p>  While work on the review is being impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phases of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400068#WRL05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[44407\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400068#WRL05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an appeal for school transport (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.<\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.

All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400069#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400069#WRM02200"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[44485\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400069#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school transport ticket will be allocated to a student (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

Inclusive Education has been strengthened in the revised standards which recognise the diverse range of needs that teachers encounter in the course of their teaching, regardless of setting, and specifically reference additional learning needs such as autism in this context. As part of the Review and Accreditation process, all programmes of ITE will have to provide evidence of how the core elements are explored and examined with student teachers during the course of their programme. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is currently working on a policy statement for ITE which we anticipate will be published later this year.  The objective of the policy statement is to document the current policy and provision for ITE at primary and post-primary level in order to increase clarity to the system.

This will add an additional &euro;32 million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180 million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. <\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019\/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on 3 April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400070#WRN03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400070#WRN03300"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[44640\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400070#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the average primary school class size in the Clondalkin area; the national average of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The average class size for primary schools in the Clondalkin area is 22.1 and the national average is 22.8<\/p><p>The above figures are calculated from the 2021-22 primary class size tables, the most recent available, which are published on our website at www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/class-size-information-at-individual-primary-school-level\/ <\/p><p>Note: Clondalkin schools are all mainstream primary schools in the primary class size tables containing Clondalkin or Cluain Dolc&aacute;in in their address fields.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400070#WRN03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400070#WRN03600"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[44641\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400070#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children that are on waiting lists for the National Educational Psychological Service in Dublin Mid-West; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.

It involves an educational programme to enhance overall development, help prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.  The Early Start programme runs in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage, and has capacity for 1,620 children each year.

This scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  <\/p>  <p>  The CWS is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Based on the available data, it is estimated that 63% of all SWA payments are decided within 4 weeks from the date of application and 92% are decided within eight weeks of application.  50% of applications for Additional Needs Payments are finalised within 0-4 weeks and 90% are finalised within 0-8 weeks.  Where an application is not finalised within this timeframe, this is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the customer to support their application.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has introduced innovations this year which have increased efficiency in processing applications for SWA payments.  One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake the preparatory work on applications - for example, the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country and it has been found to be very effective in releasing Community Welfare Officers (CWO) from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.  It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with customers as required and to process claims.  This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a new National CWS Claims Decisions Team is being established this month to work on finalising SWA applications.  Where claims require further contact with the customer or a home visit is required, the claim will remain with the local CWO to be finalised.  This Claims Decisions Team is based in multiple locations around the country.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of crucial Community Welfare Services to meet the challenges and the needs of vulnerable customers across the country remains a priority for my Department. The continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.   <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400073#WRQ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":947,"content":"<p>Question No. 365 answered with Question No. 364.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":948,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400073#WRQ05412"},{"type":"question","counter":949,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[44414\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400073#WRQ05425","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that South Dublin County Partnership has been successfully awarded lot 15 under the procurement competition for the new nationwide Intreo Partner Employment Services and as a result will be enforcing compulsory redundancy for 37 staff members; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":950,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from the Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":951,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400073#WRQ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":952,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[44415\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400073#WRQ05600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address the concerns raised in correspondence by stakeholders within the insurance industry regarding Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision regulations and legislation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1614","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":953,"content":"<p>IORP II, which became effective from 13 January 2019, sets out minimum standards for the management and supervision of pension schemes, with the objective of ensuring the soundness of occupational pensions and better protections for scheme members and beneficiaries across the European Union.  IORP II requirements were transposed into Irish law by way of the European Union (Occupational Pension Schemes) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 128 of 2021) which came into force on 22nd April 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The general principle followed in respect of the transposition of IORP II, in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Pensions Reform, is that the requirements of IORP II apply to all schemes and trust Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs), including one-member arrangements (OMAs).  This is in order to ensure that all members and beneficiaries are afforded equal protection irrespective of the size of the pension arrangement.  It should be noted that the decision to apply the requirements of IORP II to all schemes and trust RACs was announced by the Government in 2019 and it was expected that trustees and insurance providers would have been preparing for compliance with these requirements in advance of transposition.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of OMAs established on or after S.I. No. 128 of 2021, such arrangements are required to meet all new IORP II related requirements set out under the 1990 Act, where applicable, from the date on which they were established.

The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is fully exempt from income tax, PRSI and USC. The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget Measures 2021, the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150. The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021. The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year.

At the end of June some 121,551 grants were issued in respect of 136,054 care recipients.<\/p>  <p>  One of the principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Support is that full time care and attention is required and being provided. A carer will be regarded as providing full-time care and attention to a relevant person, where the number of hours providing such care is not less than 35 hours in a period of 7 consecutive days, and care is provided on any 5 days, whether consecutive or not, within a period of 7 consecutive days. The provision of full-time care and attention requirement is moderated somewhat by allowing a carer to work or engage in education or training for up to 18.5 hours per week. During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 18.5-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of circumstances, set out in legislation, where a carer cannot not qualify for the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant including where a person is signing for credited contributions. A credit may be awarded (subject to certain qualifying conditions) for each week to bridge the gap between periods of insurable employment where a person has a break in their insurance record because of illness, unemployment or other eligible scenario. Under certain circumstances a person may be awarded credits without receiving a Benefit or Allowance payment. This may apply, for example, in the case of a person who has exhausted entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit but who does not qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance due to their means. In this case, the person may be entitled to 'sign' for credits to protect their other social insurance entitlements. In order to be entitled to Unemployment Credits, a person must be available for full-time employment, capable of work and must also be genuinely seeking work.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not intend to extend eligibility to the Carer's Support Grant in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy as it would be inconsistent with the intent of the payment. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Meals Programme","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[44486\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will allocate additional funding to a school (details supplied) for the school meals programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":963,"content":"<p>The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,700 schools and organisations benefitting 260,000 children.

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system provides for a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods (of up to 20 years) outside of paid employment in the calculation of a payment rate.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them.  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system. <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021.  It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  The report set out a wide range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years). It recommended that long-term carers should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring.  The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory \"Family Carer Register\" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report need to be considered very carefully and holistically.

The Department is charged with identifying where a person has an income support need and providing that income support, for example in the form for instance of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, a disability allowance, or a carer's allowance. <\/p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by the Department of Social Protection are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. Spending in 2022 is expected to amount to over &euro;1.5 billion. <\/p>  <p>  - Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means-tested payment for people living in Ireland who are looking after someone who needs support because of age, physical or learning disability or illness, including mental illness. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is primarily aimed at carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. As of July there were 91,093 recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. <\/p>  <p>  There are other income supports available for carers provided by the Department of Social Protection that are not means-tested; these include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). As of July there were 3,346 recipients of Carer's Benefit. <\/p>  <p>  - The annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means or social insurance contributions. The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. As part of Budget Measures 2021, the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150.  The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021. The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year. At the end of June some 121,551 grants were issued in respect of 136,054 care recipients.<\/p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested. The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month. There is no restriction on the number of children in respect of whom Domiciliary Care Allowance may be claimed. In other words, a person caring for more than one child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance may claim the monthly allowance for each child. As of July there were 48,430 families in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance in respect of some 54,126 children. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, the Government introduced a range of measures benefitting family carers directly, including:<\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all core weekly payments including carers;<\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments;<\/p>  <p>  - an increase in the capital disregard for carers from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000;<\/p>  <p>  - the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has increased to &euro;350 per week for single carers, and to &euro;750 per week for a couple.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2022, the Government doubled the period of time for which Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are paid for children who are hospitalised. These supports now continue to be paid for 26 weeks, as opposed to the previous 13-week period, to the parents or guardians of children under 16. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from the income supports mentioned above, this Department also provides a support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Under this scheme, the Department may make an additional needs payment to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, considering all the circumstances of the case. This ensures that the payments target those most in need of assistance. The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently on a social welfare payment or working on a low income. Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is not possible to provide the estimated annual cost of providing a weekly payment of &euro;230 in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. The Department of Social Protection has no basis for collecting data on how many children require\/or would require a hospital stay.<\/p>  <p>  This matter may be more relevant to my colleague the Minister for Health. Similar schemes are available in the UK and are available through the NHS; for example, people in the UK on a low income, may be able to get help with NHS costs, such as claims for help with travel costs if they are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16, through the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS). <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":975,"content":"<p>Question No. 374 answered with Question No. 373.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":976,"content":"<p>Question No. 375 answered with Question No. 373.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR02100"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[44587\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons employed in her Department that have a formal agreement to work from home one day per week, two days per week and five days per week; her Department&rsquo;s policy in respect of facilitating requests by persons to work from home; and the number of persons that have made requests to work from home in 2021 and to date in 2022, that have been declined.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>As an essential service, staff in the Department of Social Protection continued, in 2021, to work both onsite and remotely to deliver services to our customers as part of temporary working arrangements put in place by local business areas.

During 2022 to date, this number remained relatively constant and was a continuation of the temporary working arrangements put in place by local business areas.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2022, the Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations was published. In June 2022, my Department published a formal Blended Working Policy, informed by the Framework. The introduction of this formal policy draws a line under all prior temporary arrangements, with formal agreed Blended Working arrangements commencing on 12th September 2022.  Under the Policy, my Department will operate varied on-site attendance levels and patterns based on eligibility criteria to include business requirements, individual and role suitability, and remote workstation arrangements.  Work patterns range from a minimum attendance of 4 days per calendar month to full attendance on-site.<\/p>  <p>  To avail of Bended Working under the policy, staff must formally request a blended working arrangement by following an application process which takes the eligibility criteria into account as part of the decision making process. <\/p>  <p>As at 7th   September 2022, under the Policy, from 12th September, approximately 50% of the total staff number will have a formal agreement in place to commence a form of blended working arrangement from that date.

These formal agreements will end in December 2022 after which staff must apply again under the Blended Working Policy and follow an annual process thereafter.

There is also inherent flexibility in the policy for staff to opt-out of or adapt their blended working arrangements at any time subject to agreement, and inherent flexibility in the policy on the requirement for staff to attend onsite in person as business needs arise.<\/p>  <p>  As there was no formal applications process in 2021, no staff had had their application for blended working declined during that period.

The Fund is central to Ireland&rsquo;s system of social protection and the Government needs to ensure that it can provide adequate and sustainable social insurance pensions and benefits for a growing and ageing population.<\/p><p>Self-employed people pay contributions to the Social Insurance Fund at a lower rate of 4%. People with Class S contributions, however, qualify for the following payments where all qualification criteria for the particular scheme are satisfied:<\/p><p>- Adoptive Benefit;<\/p><p>- Guardian's Payment (Contributory);<\/p><p>- Invalidity Pension;<\/p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed);<\/p><p>- Maternity Benefit;<\/p><p>- Parent's Benefit;<\/p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension);<\/p><p>- Paternity Benefit;<\/p><p>- State Pension (Contributory);<\/p><p>- Treatment Benefit; and<\/p><p>- Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.<\/p><p>The benefits to which Class S PRSI does not provide access are Carer's Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit, Illness Benefit, and Occupational Injuries Benefits.<\/p><p>Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19, primarily as a public health measure. The purpose of this enhanced Illness Benefit payment is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.<\/p><p>There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them. In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.<\/p><p>My Department keeps its range of supports under review to ensure that they meet their overall objectives.

The continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.  <\/p>  <p>  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres, including at Newbridge Intreo Centre which covers the Naas area, across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting customers in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment with a person at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home if needed.  <\/p>  <p>  The CWS is aware of the crucial role played by St. Vincent De Paul Society (SVP) in society and there is excellent co-operation\/liaison in place with them.  There has been a series of engagements with SVP this year at both national and local levels to update that organisation on recent developments in the CWS.  The Department has provided information on the recently publicised Additional Needs Payments for the SVP&rsquo;s bulletin.  There are plans for my Department and the SVP to participate in a webinar with SVP volunteers in the coming weeks and to release a video of the webinar to their volunteer network. <\/p>  <p>  Following your representation, I have arranged for an official from my Department to contact the representative from SVP to discuss changes to the CWS delivery arrangements and to address the concerns raised.<\/p>  <p>  On a point of information, the phone number quoted in the detail of the Question is no longer in operation.  A freephone National Contact Phoneline for CWS (0818 60 70 80) was launched in June this year which further enhances access to CWS nationwide.  This is a dedicated phoneline for customers located anywhere across the country seeking to get information on CWS and access to a CWO to seek assistance and support.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the national phoneline commenced operation, more and more customers are availing of the opportunity to have their issues resolved by this method rather than by calling into an office. Customers in Naas can access the service via this telephone number without the need to travel to Newbridge.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that a person no longer has to meet in person with a CWO to make a claim. A customer can make an application for assistance by completing a SWA1 form, which is widely available.  It can be downloaded at www.gov.ie and is available in all Intreo Centres and Branch Offices. It can also now be requested by emailing cwsforms@welfare.ie or by calling freephone 0818 60 70 80. <\/p>  <p>  Customers can also request a SWA1 form by using the Request Application Form page available on www.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Applications for SWA assistance should be directed to: <\/p>  <p>  An Roinn Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute; \/ Department of Social Protection <\/p>  <p>  Bosca PO 1107, Droichead Nua, Co Chill Dara, W12 T257 <\/p>  <p>  PO BOX 1107, Newbridge, Co Kildare, W12 T257<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizens Information Services","counter":992,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR03600"},{"type":"question","counter":993,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[44658\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the way that she will ensure that the Citizens Information Board remains a quality service for individuals given the recent structural staffing and volunteer changes in the organisation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":994,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[44659\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400074#WRR03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the input and oversight that she has had on the new Citizens Information Board volunteer strategy given her Department&rsquo;s responsibility for this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":995,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 381 and 382 together.<\/p>  <p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is a statutory body tasked with providing information, advocacy and advice to citizens.

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct limited resources in as targeted a manner as possible.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.<\/p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme.  It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.

All organisations were notified of the relevant timelines in advance, and this was clearly indicated in the Call for Applications in April of last year.

CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.<\/p><p>My Department launched a freephone National Contact Phoneline for CWS in June this year which further enhances access to CWS nationwide.  This is a dedicated phoneline available to people across the country to get information on CWS and access to a CWO to seek assistance and support.

One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake the preparatory work on applications - for example, the registration of claims and the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country, including Kerry, and it has been found to be very effective in releasing CWOs from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.  It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with people as required and to process claims.  This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Claims activity in the Community Welfare Service is closely monitored at all times and changes to modernise and improve the service for clients are a feature of the service. The delivery of a locally based CWS remains and will continue to remain a cornerstone of the service.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400075#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1029,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 392.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":1030,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400075#WRS01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1031,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[44937\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400075#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when an entitlement to a farm-assist payment can be restored in the case of a person (details supplied) who received notification to the effect that their payment would be stopped unless a reply to correspondence was received within a specific time which happened to be family-holiday time; if their entitlement can be restored forthwith; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1032,"content":"<p>Farm Assist is a means-tested payment for low-income farmers.

The paper &ldquo;Funding the Future, an annual options paper on reducing the cost of higher education can be found here: <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/28c9d-funding-the-future-an-annual-options-paper-on-reducing-the-cost-of-higher-education\/ <\/i><\/p><p>This paper is further step in deepening my commitment to the progressive consideration and implementation of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, within the overall context of Government policy towards costs of living and other relevant strategies including those related to access and participation in education.  <\/p><p>I have already taken a number of significant steps in this regard, including major changes to the SUSI student support scheme and the elimination of participation fees for PLC courses from this September.<\/p><p>With this in mind, it is important to highlight the very substantial financial support, currently well in excess of half a billion euro, provided by the taxpayer towards tuition fees and the student contribution for students in higher education. This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357 million per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190 million paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students. <\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education.<\/p><p>I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction for student and families with an increase in the funding provided by the state, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families. <\/p><p>My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.<\/p><p>As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  Unfortunately at this time it is not possible to pre-empt the outcome or funding for student support measures in advance of Government's Budget 2023 announcement on 27 September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400076#WRT02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1099,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[44753\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400076#WRT02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that a person (details supplied) has monies outstanding to Maynooth University; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1100,"content":"<p>The Student Grant Scheme, administered by SUSI, provides grant assistance to students pursuing an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. <\/p>  <p>I have been advised by my officials that the student outlined by the Deputy registered onto a course in the Technological University of Dublin (TUD), and, onto a course in Maynooth University in the 2021\/2022 academic year.

Under this legislation the institutions are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including the mode of delivery of programmes of study. HEIs have taken significant steps to ensure that teaching and learning is enhanced by the integrated use of digital technologies, both on-campus and remotely. <\/p>  <p>  Many HEIs are and will be developing new blended learning programmes for validation. Such programmes need to be designed, delivered and assessed within an approved quality assurance framework developed by HEIs with reference to the Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Blended Learning Programmes. Programmes that are delivered partially or fully online, need to be developed with that mode of delivery in mind rather than merely being translated or transferred from the original face-to-face programme model.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, key stakeholders from across the higher education sector worked collaboratively to reflect on the sudden move to online\/remote learning in higher education, gather related evidence and to agree a way forward post-pandemic. Partners included the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, QQI, USI, representative bodies of HEIs, and others. The resulting report, &lsquo;Next Steps for Teaching and Learning: Moving Forward Together&rsquo; was launched in November 2021. The report includes recommendations for the sector with regard to blended\/remote teaching and learning and the use of technology to ensure that higher education is as flexible, resilient and equitable as possible for all who learn, all who teach, all who support and lead, and our wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2022, the HEA announced &euro;37.62 million in funding for the National Technological University Transformation for Recovery and Resilience, NTUTORR, programme. The programme was informed by the Next Steps report and this funding will enable the technological sector to systematise the learnings from the experience of digitally enabled education and support the provision of digitally enhanced teaching, learning and assessment to meet the needs of staff, students, and enterprise in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  The fourth National Access Plan, 2022 to 2028, which launched last month, places an emphasis on student- centred goals, including flexibility. It aims to support students to study on a flexible basis including part-time and blended learning, and identify connectivity supports for remote learning. This is a seven-year plan with an additional dedicated investment of &euro;35 million over the course of the plan. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding student accommodation fundamentally, the challenge is one of supply of housing more generally. As a country, we know that we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation. That is why the Government has launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage setting out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis. The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion. Since taking up office, both my Department officials and I have engaged and continue to engage on as ongoing basis with the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the wider higher education sector and relevant stakeholders on student accommodation issues including within the context of the advancement of the Government's Housing for All policy.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in June this year I met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and technological universities to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified or be able to identify in relation to any additional student accommodation provision that may be pursued in the short to medium terms and the Department is continuing to liaise with the higher education institutions in this regard. In a welcome development, the sector indicates that hundreds of additional bed spaces have been made available by higher education institutions for the start of this academic year and NUIG will be delivering some 674 new bed spaces later next year. Subsequently in July following a case I made to the Cabinet Committee on Housing, my Department has received support to progress a new policy that bridges the challenging gap between the viability of delivering purpose-built student accommodation and subsequent rental affordability for students. This could involve the State assisting with the cost of building student accommodation in return for affordability commitments on rent. Work is continuing on this policy and the Department is also ready to work with any of the new technological universities to support them to borrow to build student accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  On rent affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up-front for their accommodation, ending the practice whereby students were required to pay a lump sum up-front each term. The total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy is now no more than the equivalent of two months&rsquo; rent &ndash; that is one month&rsquo;s rent, and one month&rsquo;s deposit.<\/p>  <p>  Student accommodation is subject to rent pressure zone caps and students now have recourse to the Residential Tenancies Board for dispute resolution. In addition to the extra accommodation which is being put in place this year, amounting to hundreds of beds, it is also open to homeowners to rent a room to students. A homeowner can rent a room, retain their social welfare entitlements where applicable and earn up to &euro;14,000 in rental income before having to pay tax. <\/p>  <p>  All higher education institutions continue to support their students to find accommodation in the private rental sector through, for example, the encouragement of room rental or student digs in family homes and many also maintain online databases where students can search for and check out accommodation, advertisements for room rentals can be placed and advice on sample rental agreements provided. Institutions are actively promoting this option in their localities and I understand that there is in excess of 1,500 room rentals for students available on university databases across the country this week. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400076#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Qualifications Recognition","counter":1113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400076#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1114,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[44893\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400076#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a student who obtained their degree as a social care worker from a third level institution (details supplied) and who is currently working as a social care worker will have their qualifications recognised by CORU under the grandparent scheme; if their QQI qualification will be recognised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1115,"content":"<p>My Department has been advised by the Department of Health of the following arrangement regarding social care workers.<\/p><p>The Social Care Workers Register is due to open on the 30 November 2023.

It is worth noting that Government investment in Higher Education is not specifically allocated against a per student metric and state investment in the sector is not limited to the recurrent grant funding of institutions.<\/p>  <p>  Government provides financial support to the higher education sector through a number of streams including direct recurrent grants, and indirectly through a number of specific parameters including free fees, policy initiatives, competitive programme calls, Springboard+, Human Capital Initiative and SUSI fee supports. In addition institutions can receive research funding from national and international research activities. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of recurrent grant funding my Department allocates funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions (HEIs). The funding allocations to the HEIs, through the HEA&rsquo;s Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM), are based on a funding formula that is informed by eligible student numbers from the previous academic year. Eligible Level 9 students are included in the funding model. The annual core grant is allocated by the HEA to the higher education institutions as a block grant as a contribution towards teaching, research and supporting activities.<\/p>  <p>  Institutions are advised in their annual grant letter that the internal allocation of funds between teaching, research and supporting activities are a matter for each institution. Thus, there is full institutional autonomy to deploy this block grant in the most effective manner to achieve it mission across teaching, research and supporting activities. In this regard it is not possible to attribute a set amount as provided per level nine student or to level nine courses in public higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of how the RGAM utilises student numbers the HEA advise that eligible student numbers are converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs) and weighted for the relative costs pertaining to different disciplines. <\/p>  <p>  The three main subject price groups by which students are weighted are: Non-lab (weighting of 1), Fieldwork (1.3) and Lab (1.7) which relate to the areas of study. Under the RGAM, postgraduate Level 9 students (taught &amp;amp; research) receive additional weightings. An amount of funding is allocated on the basis of research and access measures and Level 9 students are also included in the metrics which inform these allocations.<\/p>  <p>  The overall funding available is divided by the total number of weighted FTE student numbers and the resulting amount per FTE is called &ldquo;standard resource&rdquo;.

As apprentices are employees, the demand for and number of apprentices is primarily dictated by the employers in any area or sector.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners, to achieve a target of 10,000 annual registrations across a wide range of programmes by 2025.<\/p><p>Meeting these targets requires a responsive apprenticeship system that provides a strong value proposition for employers and potential apprentices, is attractive and easy to engage with, and that delivers high standards and sought after qualifications.<\/p><p>We have made important progress to date. Last year saw a record 8,607 registrations. This is an increase of nearly 40% compared to 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; year. This is a strong foundation on which to build as we advance delivery of the <i>Action Plan<\/i>, in order to embed apprenticeship as a preferred route to skills development.<\/p><p>In tandem with the impacts of Covid-19 public health measures, this growth is one of the factors impacting capacity in the training system. As a result, the number of craft apprentices waiting to progress their off-the-job training in phase 2, phase 4, and phase 6, attached in tabular form are the figures for the end of July which are the most recent available. <\/p><p>At the end of July there were 7464 apprentices waiting for off the job training. This month will see over 2,000 of these apprentices take up places in the coming academic term. <\/p><p>The number of apprentices waiting is steadily reducing from almost 12,000 in August 2021. Key is this is the continued development of apprenticeship and upskilling educational and or retraining facilities, including: <\/p><p>- Capital funding of &euro;20 million was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade facilities.<\/p><p>- Further funding of &euro;17 million has been provided to SOLAS and the HEA to address Covid-related backlogs, &euro;6 million of which is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.<\/p><p>- To ensure that there is capacity to meet the training needs of rapidly increasing numbers of apprentices, expansion of the apprenticeship system is continuing in 2022, with further major investment in workshops and staff is planned for this year.<\/p><p>Specifically, the funding includes:<\/p><p>- The development of two large training hubs dedicated to electrical training for the next three years;<\/p><p>- Expansion of electrical, plumbing, and carpentry programmes across further and higher education;<\/p><p>- The construction of electrical workshops at Kilkenny and Carlow ETB and the development of a training facility in Donegal;<\/p><p>- A call for additional phase 2 capacity in craft programmes that include carpentry, plumbing and refrigeration Expansion of electrical apprenticeships in ATU Donegal and MTU Kerry.<\/p><p>I am confident that these measures will contribute to the further development of the apprenticeship system, so that it continues to make a valued contribution to our skills response.<\/p><p><ahref=\"https:\/\/data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2022-09-14_pq428-14-09-22_en.xlsx\">Waiting List<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400076#WRT05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1132,"content":"<p>Question No. 429 answered with Question No. 428.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400077#WRU00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":1133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400077#WRU00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1134,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[44417\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400077#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1135,"content":"<p>The application for the person referred to by the Deputy was received by the Undocumented Unit of my Department on 17 February 2022 and continues to be processed.

The State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community.<\/p>  <p>  Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. It is acknowledged that certain rural GMS vacancies can be difficult to fill; as of last month, there were 25 GMS GP vacancies, 14 of which were in rural areas. For this reason, in addition to the more general measures taken to increase the number of GPs in the State and the significant increases in investment into general practice, specific supports are in place to support GPs in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement, the Government is increasing annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for an increase in capitation fees for GPs, additional services, improved family arrangements as well as a targeted &euro;2 million fund to support to practices in deprived urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was introduced previously to support rural GPs, these supports have been increased by 10% under the 2019 GP Agreement. In addition, practices in receipt of rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rates for practice staff support subsidies and locum contributions for leave taking. Specific fees are also in place for dispensing doctors (who operate in rural areas), these have been increased by 28% under the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  A steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022.

In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the 2013 Act to have regard to a number of criteria including clinical efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines and medical items are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <\/p>  <p>  Currently, Consultant Endocrinologists may apply to the HSE, on behalf of specific patients with Type 1 Diabetes, for reimbursement support of FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) sensors. The application process is undertaken by means of a dedicated online portal, which has been operational since 3 April 2018.  In line with the recommendations of the Health Technology Assessment Group, access to this product was made available to children and young adults, aged between 4 and 21 years of age. The online application process does cater for the Consultant to make an application in very exceptional circumstances for a type 1 diabetic patient who is over 21 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE requested that the NCPE carry out a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on Freestyle Libre, and the company, Abbott, were formally notified of this on 13 April 2021. Abbott had a scoping meeting with the NCPE in July 2021 and committed to submitting their HTA dossier by the end of October 2021. However, on 15 November 2021, Abbott informed the HSE that they would not be submitting the HTA dossier because they did not have the level of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) evidence that they stated was required for a full HTA process. Despite the HSE emphasising the importance of engaging with the HTA process to progress matters, the company have not submitted a HTA dossier to date.  It remains open to Abbott to re-engage with the NCPE as they indicated they would in July 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Recently, following a request from the HSE, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) held an initial meeting with the HSE Diabetes Clinical Programme to scope out what might be involved in undertaking a system wide HTA across diabetes care. In the absence of a full value assessment of the product to determine cost effectiveness or value for money, the HSE is not in a position to remove the current age restriction.<\/p>  <p>  During the estimates process, deliberations as to the priorities to be progressed within the National Service Plan occur.

I have met directly with NHI and updated them in detail on progress being made in relation to this matter.  I have also met with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. I have visited a number of nursing homes to discuss this issue with management of both public and private\/voluntary nursing units. It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected.  <\/p><p>Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:<\/p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home<\/p><p>-  Local market prices<\/p><p>-  Historic prices<\/p><p>-  Overall budgetary capacity<\/p><p>The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  The department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the NTPF pricing review, as well as taking forward the nine recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs published last December.<\/p><p>I would also like to highlight the other supports provided to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, has been in place since the start of the pandemic. Over &euro;143 million has been made available to date under the scheme. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment, having been extended up to September 2022. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.  In response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations by September 2022.  <\/p><p>  Given the importance of nursing homes and the NHSS to the wider health and social care system - with a budget of over &euro;1 billion, and over 22,000 residents supported - it is essential that policy measures are examined with due care in order to ensure the government's objectives are delivered and avoid unintended consequences.

The Government decision provides, subject at all times to the overarching eligibility criteria, that only eligible staff within the following cohorts are covered for this Pandemic Recognition Payment:<\/p><p>1. HSE and Section 38 organisations;<\/p><p>2. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p><p>3.

I have also met with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. I have visited a number of nursing homes to discuss this issue with management of both public and private\/voluntary nursing units.

This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:<\/p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home- Local market prices- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity<\/p><p>The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  It should also be noted that the department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021. One of these actions relates to exploring a new geographical pricing model for the sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400086#WRDD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400086#WRDD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1712,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[45091\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400086#WRDD03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1713,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400086#WRDD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":1714,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400086#WRDD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1715,"qnumday":622,"qnumall":"[45093\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022091400086#WRDD04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are any plans to streamline the process for the recruitment of non-European Union healthcare workers for the nursing home sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for the employment permits legislation and the granting of permits which facilitates the arrival of highly skilled non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment in Ireland in an eligible occupation, to meet skills demand in the economy where those skills can&rsquo;t be accessed through the resident labour force, in the short to medium term.

I am acutely aware of the emotional and financial pain associated with a TB breakdown. <\/p><p>Introduction of the new TB testing requirements are as result of the EU Animal Health Law Regulations 2016\\429. These regulations came into effect on 1st April 2021. These new regulations require that where bovine animals are being moved from farm to farm or through marts, they must have been tested for TB within a certain time frame. <\/p><p>The requirements are that:<\/p><p>1. All Bovines that are moving farm to farm or through a mart must be tested in the previous six months,<b>and<\/b><\/p><p>2. They must also be moving from a herd that been tested in the last six months.<\/p><p>If they do not fulfil both of these requirements, they must be tested, either within the 30 days prior to movement or within 30 days after movement into the new herd.<\/p><p>These new requirements are aimed at reducing the level of transmissible disease in animals, including bovines. These requirements are directly applicable across all EU member states. As this is not a discretionary matter, my Department did not complete an analysis on competition impacts.<\/p><p>The Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum which comprises of representatives from across the agri-food sector, leading researchers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has agreed to the introduction of these mandatory requirements on a phased basis. These new measures should play a part in assisting the reduction of bTB in the years ahead.<\/p><p>Where animals that move do not satisfy the two testing-interval requirements, the initial phase of implementation will see the requirement for either pre-or post-movement test  activated in respect of cows of all ages and male animals over the age of 36 months. This first phase will come into effect on 1<sup>st<\/sup>February 2023. At present, no date has been set for phase two, which will see the rule applied to all animals. This will only be done in dialogue with farm organisations. <\/p><p>If the animal does not meet the TB testing criteria then the animal is restricted to the herd that received it and it is required to have a post movement test within 30 days,  If the animal is alive and has not tested within the 30 days then the herd is restricted and the animal must  be tested within another 30 days. If the animal is alive and has not been TB tested within another 30 days then the herd will remain restricted and the herd will be scheduled for a full herd TB test. <\/p><p>The responsibility to ensure that animals are tested in compliance with these requirements ultimately rests with the purchaser of the animals. <\/p><p>The majority of animals being moved currently satisfy these time intervals and so in such cases no additional testing will be required. <\/p><p>Herd owners either selling or buying animals can time their annual herd test to coincide with the sale or purchase of animals.
