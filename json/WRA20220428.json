These trends are driven primarily by global factors. The key drivers of this increase are increases in wholesale energy prices as a result of the rapid rebound in global demand, global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between demand and supply that emerged as economies re-opened.More recently, as a result of the war in Ukraine, oil and gas prices have risen further.  It is not possible for the Government to fully insulate consumers against these price impacts, however, a number of very significant steps have been taken to lessen the impact of increased fuel prices.  <\/p><p>On fuel excise, a package of measures, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10 March reducing the VAT inclusive excise duty on petrol, diesel and MGO by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively. These reductions mitigate the cost of a fill of a 60 litre tank by some &euro;12 for petrol and &euro;9 for diesel. This assists all transport users, rural and urban, including commuters, business and farmers. These measures are now being extended to 12 October 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO. The extended measures will cost a further &euro;97m.<\/p><p>Energy taxation in Ireland is governed by the Energy Taxation Directive, which sets out excise duty rules covering all energy products in the EU used for heating and transport, as well as electricity.  The Directive sets out minimum levels of taxation applicable to these energy products for specific fuel uses.For diesel used as a propellant, the minimum rate is &euro;330.00 per 1000 Litres exclusive of VAT.  This equates to 33 cents per litre.  <\/p><p>The March 9<sup>th<\/sup>(pre reduction) rate on MOT on diesel was 53.55 cent per litre.The subsequent reductions have brought the overall MOT rate to 40.54 cents per litre.  The Diesel Rebate Scheme operates a price cap of 7.5 cent per litre bringing the effective rate of excise paid to 33.04 cents for those availing of the relief.<\/p><p>For this reason, it is not possible to reduce the rate on MOT on diesel by any more than 15 cents VAT inclusive.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 7 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[21258\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Ireland or Europe imposes any tax on fertiliser or the sale of agricultural fertiliser; if so, the percentage breakdown of this tax; if any environmental taxes are imposed on the sale or purchasing of fertiliser; and if the Government have plans to impose such a tax.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

This was driven by particularly strong growth in income tax, VAT and corporation tax.  Total tax revenue was up by over &euro;4 billion, or more than 30 per cent, on the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  Income tax receipts in the quarter were up by &euro;900 million, or 16 per cent, on the first quarter of 2021. This is a reflection of the strong recovery in the labour market, with employment now at its highest level ever.  The strong rebound in VAT receipts &ndash; up by &euro;1.4 billion, or more than 30 per cent &ndash; points to the recovery in consumer spending. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is important to remember that these annual comparisons are flattered by a number of factors, such as the impact of stringent public health restrictions in the first quarter of last year, as well as the temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT (which straddled part of the first quarter of last year).  These exaggerate the year-on-year growth. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, even when compared to 2019 &ndash; the &lsquo;pre-pandemic&rsquo; position &ndash; VAT receipts are still up significantly, by 17 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  Excise receipts of &euro;1.2 billion were broadly flat on last year. This is due, in part, to the measures Government has taken to address the rising cost of living by reducing excise on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil, and likely also reflects the impact of rising energy prices. <\/p>  <p>  Corporation tax receipts were &euro;1.9 billion in the quarter, up by &euro;1.3 billion on the same period last year. This is due in part to a timing issue, whereby receipts that would have been expected in August of this year have been received earlier, distorting the annual comparison.  It also reflects increased profitability in a small number of taxpayers in the ICT sector. <\/p>  <p>  I would caution that these figures are backward-looking: my Department expects that economic activity will be negatively affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the coming months, with implications for the public finances by way of slower tax revenue growth and higher expenditure associated with re-settling Ukrainian refugees. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth pointing out that sovereign borrowing costs are now rising and so the capacity of the Government to run large deficits is more constrained than during the pandemic. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":21,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 11 and 12 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[20548\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if motor insurance premiums are decreasing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis.

For this year, the level of public debt is projected at &euro;234 billion, or 96.5 per cent of modified national income.<\/p><p>Finally, it is also worth pointing out that sovereign borrowing costs are now rising, meaning the Government's capacity to finance large deficits is more constrained than it was during the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[21473\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of the tourism and hospitality sector regarding the inflationary impact of increasing the VAT rate from 9% to 13.5% from 1 September 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[21472\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans regarding the increase of the VAT rate for tourism and hospitality businesses from 9% to 13.5% from 1 September 2022; his views on whether this is the wrong time to proceed with such a move; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 40 together.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, Budget 2021 brought the VAT rate for Hospitality and Tourism related services and goods down from 13.5% to 9%.

While the apprentice is attending &lsquo;off-the-job&rsquo; training, an &lsquo;off-the-job&rsquo; training payment is paid every two weeks by the Education and Training Board through the Department of Education. <\/p>  <p>  - 'Off-the-job' payments are aligned to gross wages paid by industry in each sector. All 'off-the-job' training payments are subject to statutory deductions of Income Tax, PRSI and USC. The rate of tax that is paid will depend on the apprentice's own personal circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  - In some cases, the Education and Training Board will also contribute an &lsquo;off-the-job&rsquo; training allowance to an apprentice's travel and accommodation costs. All 'off-the-job' training allowances are not subject to statutory tax deductions.<\/p>  <p>  - For Revenue purposes, 'off-the-job' training is registered as a separate Department of Education employment to that of the apprentice's sponsoring employer. Appropriate changes to tax credits and\/or rate bands between multiple employments can be made through Revenue's myAccount system.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, apprentices who began apprenticeships from 2016 onwards are paid by their employer for the duration of their apprenticeship. As such, they would not be in receipt of payments from the Education and Training Board for 'off-the-job' training. The rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and their employer.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question in respect of providing a tax exemption for apprenticeship allowances paid during off-site training, it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the EU and OECD. This means that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system is designed to ensure that those on lower incomes pay less tax than those who earn more. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines make clear that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.<\/p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I have no plans to provide for an exemption along the lines suggested by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA05400"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[14985\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800054#WRA05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the quantum of taxes, by category, that have been warehoused arising from the provisions in the emergency legislation dealing with Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>The Debt Warehousing Scheme was introduced to provide a vital liquidity support to businesses suffering a downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible for EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.<\/p><p>The relevant public health restrictions are those that were in place between 20 December 2021 and 22 January 2022 and imposed an 8pm closing time on hospitality venues, including restaurants, bars and cafes, and reduced capacity on many indoor events, thus directly curtailing the ability of the businesses to trade. <b><\/b><\/p><p>Revenue is operating these changes to the scheme on an administrative basis, pending enactment of the current Finance (Covid-19 &amp;amp; Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.  <\/p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme represents a substantial and key part of this Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid crisis. It has been an extremely successful policy intervention and one which has greatly assisted us in maintaining the link between employers and employees.  The overall support provided to date (21<sup>st<\/sup>April) is &euro;7.79 billion, comprising direct subsidy payments of almost &euro;6.76 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;1.03 billion to 51,900 employers in respect of 734,200 employees.<\/p><p>Without the support of EWSS, many businesses would simply not be in existence today and would certainly not be in a position to adapt as responsively as they have to the reopening of all sectors of our economy.  <\/p><p>The EWSS operates as a highly effective and responsive instrument. At the same time, we must seek to ensure it is withdrawn at the right time.  <\/p><p>By end April 2022, a wage subsidy scheme (TWSS or EWSS) will have been in place for over 2 years. Any further prolongation of EWSS runs contrary to the original objectives of the EWSS as an emergency measure to assist businesses through the pandemic.  We are now, correctly, in the final phase of the scheme which is important for everyone, including the businesses themselves and the wider body of taxpayers given the substantial cost to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Finally, the EWSS is one of many supports provided by the Government during the pandemic.

Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching an all-time high of 7.4 per cent in March. The key driver of inflation over the past six months or so has been increases in wholesale energy prices, driven by the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. In Ireland, energy prices are currently contributing almost 4 percentage points to the annual inflation rate.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the impact of rising energy prices on citizens, in particular on those on low incomes, and has introduced a series of measures in recent months at a cost of over &euro;2 billion to help address the rising cost of living. Specifically, this month, the Government announced measures amounting to almost &euro;200 million, including a temporary reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas to 9 per cent, which will help offset some of the recent increases in energy prices. Households will make estimated savings of around &euro;50 on gas supplies and &euro;70 on electricity supplies on annualised basis from this measure. An additional once-off lump sum payment of the fuel allowance will also be made and the reduction in excise duty will be extended to mid-October.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the reduction in excise duty of 20 per cent per litre for petrol and 15 per cent per litre for diesel announced in March as well as the cost of living package introduced in mid-February, which amounted to around &euro;500 million.

Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. A broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Gini coefficient&rsquo; is a standard measurement of income inequality used internationally, whereby 0 represents a situation where all households have an equal income and 1 indicates that one household has all national income. The position is that in Ireland, income inequality measured on the basis of disposable income using the Gini coefficient stood at 0.29 based on the latest OECD data for 2018. This figure is below the OECD average and points to the strongly redistributive nature of the tax and welfare system in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The contribution of the tax and welfare system to enhancing income equality can be measured by the relative fall in the Gini coefficient between market and disposable incomes. The latest OECD data show that Ireland recorded the third largest fall in the Gini coefficient between market and disposable income (after Finland and Belgium), with most of this reduction achieved due to welfare measures.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the ESRI have shown that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system does more than any other country in the EU to reduce the gap between market and disposable incomes. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the progressivity of the income tax system, the Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 2022, the top 1.6 per cent of income earners will pay 27.7 per cent of total income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) receipts.  Furthermore, just over 55 per cent of total income tax and USC receipts will be paid by the top 8.3 per cent of taxpayer units (those earning over &euro;100,000).<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the suite of tax and welfare policy changes introduced in Budget 2022 are broadly progressive, with the gains from the package of direct taxes and welfare measures combined more keenly felt by those in the lower income deciles.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal run of events, the issue of proposed increases to senior executive pay is largely a matter for individual employers. However, the Department of Finance monitors income inequality, particularly in the context of the distributional impact of tax and social welfare measures introduced as part of the annual Budget.<\/p>  <p>  The broad economic and fiscal parameters for the Budget in the autumn will be presented in the Summer Economic Statement.  It is within this context and the overall macro-fiscal position that budgetary options, including those relating to income tax, will be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800055#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800055#WRB04300"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[21458\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800055#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the high residential vacancy rates in parts of Ireland; and if he is considering a new vacant property tax to help tackle the issue of long-standing residential vacancy and dereliction to increase housing supply in towns and cities.","asker":"1601","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[20078\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800055#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 23 of 22 February 2022, the status of the research and collection of data on property vacancies by his Department with a view to introducing a vacant property tax; if the data collection has been concluded to date; when he expects to bring proposals for the vacant property tax before Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[21369\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800055#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the collection of data on vacancy levels as per the Housing for All plan; the status of the proposed vacant property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 55 and 77 together.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a Vacant Property Tax.

Rather, the SBCI operates through its partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers. <\/p>  <p>  The SBCI has an independent Board and SBCI activities are subject to extensive due diligence processes in advance of any decisions to lend or provide guarantees. The SBCI's schemes and on-lender criteria are designed to mitigate risks to Irish taxpayers, European funding and to SME borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  Since the SBCI commenced operations in March 2015 and to the end of 2021, it has delivered &euro;2.8bn to more than 46,000 SMEs.

These projections are prepared against a backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the associated economic and financial sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  The main channel through which the war is impacting the economy is through higher energy and commodity prices. Higher energy prices have resulted in higher inflation, which is now expected to peak at 6&frac34; per cent in the second quarter and average 6&frac14; per cent for 2022 as a whole. Higher input prices, global supply chain disruptions and a tight labour market are also adding to non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The pass through effect of soaring energy prices will be reflected in rising costs for businesses and households. Rising costs will undermine business profitability and reduce household purchasing power. This, alongside heightened uncertainty will see firms hold back investment. As a result, my Department has revised down our growth forecasts for this year &ndash; as measured by modified domestic demand (MDD) - by 2&frac14; percentage points, and now expects growth of close to 4&frac14; per cent in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  One positive development since the autumn forecasts has been the recovery of the labour market, with the level of employment now at its highest ever level. Given the strong rebound in employment last year, employment growth is now set to slow over the course of 2022 in keeping with the overall outlook. The unemployment rate is projected to close the year at 5&frac12; per cent and by end of next year we should be approaching full employment.<\/p>  <p>  Given continued geopolitical uncertainty, however, the margin of uncertainty around these projections is significant, with the balance of risks firmly tilted to the downside. In light of this uncertainty, my Department published an additional, more severe scenario as part of the SPU, in which wholesale oil and gas prices return to their early-March levels and remain elevated relative to baseline this year and next. In this scenario gas and oil prices would be around 75 and 50 per cent respectively above the price assumptions underpinning the central economic forecast. In this scenario, inflation would peak at around 9&frac14; per cent in the third quarter and average 8&frac14; per cent in 2022; the shock would weigh on consumer spending and MDD growth as well.<\/p>  <p>  Government is acutely aware of the growing challenges many households and businesses face, particularly given rising price pressures.

Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes, therefore, cohabiting couples cannot file joint assessment tax returns or share their tax credits and tax bands in the same manner as married couples.  <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  <\/p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting. <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.

The rise in wholesale energy prices is the key contributor and reflects the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. <\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, energy prices increases will continue to feed into higher inflation over the coming months. The war has also led to a spike in the price of other commodities while further impairing global supply chains.

Firstly, Budget 2022 contained a combined income tax and social welfare package amounting to almost &euro;1.1 billion. A suite of measures was then introduced in mid-February, amounting to around &euro;500 million, including an energy credit of &euro;200 to every household in the country and a once-off lump sum payment of the fuel allowance.

In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.<\/p>  <p>  The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to a more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.<\/p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions\/mobility supports for those with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022.

Furthermore, the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform is overseeing the implementation of this reform agenda, and meets regularly in this regard.  <\/p><p>  The <i>Action Plan<\/i>sets out 66 actions to protect consumers and improve the business environment; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs represent on business, community and voluntary organisations. <\/p><p>  I would note that the second <i>Action Plan Implementation Report<\/i>published this March this year showed that reform is progressing well, with some 80% of actions in the Plan now being delivered and the remaining initiated. It is my hope that the cumulative impact of these reforms will be to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for consumers, businesses, and community, voluntary and sporting organisations. <\/p><p>  Some of the key achievements of the <i>Action Plan<\/i>to date include:<\/p><p>- implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; <\/p><p>- introduction of Regulations to ban on price walking for home and motor insurance, commencing on 1 July;  <\/p><p>- establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance;  <\/p><p>- publication by the Central Bank of its National Claims Information Database Report on employer and public liability insurance, and the completion of its Review on Differential Pricing in the motor and home insurance sectors; development of legislative proposals to enhance and reform the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB);<\/p><p>- enactment of the <i>Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021<\/i>, which places perjury on a statutory footing for the first time; establishment of an &lsquo;Insurance Fraud  <\/p><p>- Office&rsquo; within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau,  and  <\/p><p>- introduction of new regulations on solicitors advertising.  <\/p><p>The remaining priority actions for completion include:  reforming the law on occupier&rsquo;s liability to rebalance the duty of care (<i>Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act 1995<\/i>);  <\/p><p>- enhancing the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) through the <i>Competition Amendment Bill<\/i>;<\/p><p>- progressing legislative proposals to reform the PIAB; and,  <\/p><p>- reducing insurance fraud, including by introducing revised guidelines for reporting insurance fraud. <\/p><p>Although not included in the Action Plan, the <i>Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 <\/i>is continuing to progress through the Oireachtas. Planned to be enacted this summer, it will support further policy development that is evidence-based and tailored to the specific circumstances in the Irish market. It is a pro-consumer piece of legislation, and will enhance transparency in this important sector. It is my hope that it can be passed through the Oireachtas without delay. <\/p><p>  In terms of engagement, there has been ongoing engagement with industry &ndash; both individual insurers and Insurance Ireland &ndash; on an ongoing basis. Minister of State Fleming has met individually with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market, twice following the adoption of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, in order to hold them to account on their commitments to pass on all savings from the insurance reform agenda to customers.  <\/p><p>  In these meetings, and during his ongoing engagement with industry, Minister of State Fleming has consistently stressed the importance of insurers reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums, and the need for insurers to respect the Guidelines by not settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them. These engagements have been positive, with insurers confirming again recently that they are committed to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and are adhering to them in their direct settlements. During these meetings, Minister of State Fleming also impressed upon insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover, particularly high-risk\/high-footfall areas. <\/p><p>  Another development of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>was the creation of the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance. The role of the Office, which is chaired by Minister of State Se&aacute;n Fleming, is to assist in reducing insurance costs by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. Since its establishment, the Office has held over 70 meetings with a wide range of key stakeholders, including representative bodies, providers and other civic society groups, to understand the gaps in the Irish insurance market. The Office has been working closely with the IDA to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve its overall competitiveness. Officials have developed a customised proposition for potential market entrants and have identified a shortlist of specific targets to engage intensively with. This will, in the first instance, target providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market. <\/p><p>  Finally, on the issue of premium prices, I would note the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s most recent Consumer Price Index data shows continuing decreases in the price of motor insurance. Motor insurance prices are now 40.0% lower than their peak in July 2016.  I believe that we need to look at the price reductions in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall reform strategy. Work remains ongoing across Government to deliver these elements of the Action Plan, and to expand these price reductions into other types of insurance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800056#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800056#WRC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[21449\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800056#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider closing down tax loopholes such as section 110 that could be utilised by oligarchs and other financially dubious entities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is the section of the corporate tax code which creates a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.

This is a European Commission initiative to mobilise capital in Europe, a main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Securitisation involves the creation of tradeable securities out of an income stream or projected future income stream generated by financial assets.  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  Such financing is useful for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of finance to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.  <\/p>  <p>  Reviews undertaken by the Central Bank of Ireland have identified just under 2% of the 3,000 Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in Ireland as having links to Russia.

Along with the unjust loss of life, millions of people have been forced to flee their homeland. Meanwhile the combined impact of the war and the economic, financial and other sanctions represent a large supply-side shock, one which has reverberated throughout the global economy. Reflecting the negative spillover effects from the war, the IMF has recently revised down its global growth forecast for this year by almost one percentage point &ndash; and now expect growth of 3 &frac12; per cent. <\/p>  <p>  For Ireland, the war in Ukraine is expected to slow, rather than derail the economic recovery. Whilst Ireland&rsquo;s direct trade links with Russia and Ukraine are very limited, we are nevertheless highly exposed to indirect effects arising from the conflict. The primary channel through which the war is already having a negative impact on the Irish economy is through higher energy and commodity prices. Rising price levels have a real bearing on the cost of living for Irish households. <\/p>  <p>  Consumer price inflation rose sharply to 6.9 per cent in March &ndash; the highest level recorded since 1984.  As set out in the Stability Programme Update, inflation is expected to remain at an elevated level for the remainder of the year, peaking in the second quarter, before easing slightly over the rest of the year. As a result, average annual inflation is expected to be around 6&frac14; per cent for this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Facing significant inflationary pressure and economic uncertainty, consumers are expected to curtail expenditure and businesses are likely to postpone investment. Reflecting these dynamics, my Department has incorporated a 2&frac14; percentage point reduction in its growth forecast for this year &ndash; based on modified domestic demand - to 4&frac14; per cent.   <\/p>  <p>  Given the high level of uncertainty at present, my Department has also constructed an alternative more severe scenario in which oil and gas prices increase by 50 and 75 per cent relative to the central assumptions.  Under this scenario, inflation would increase by an additional 2 percentage points to 8&frac14; per cent this year - peaking at 9&frac14; per cent in the third quarter &ndash; and 4&frac14; per cent next year.  Such a scenario would result in a reduction in domestic demand by around 2 percentage point over the medium term and wipe out next year&rsquo;s projected surplus.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the impact on prices, a number of Ireland&rsquo;s key trading partners in Europe are highly dependent on commodities imports from Russia and Ukraine. If this disruption to trade was to persist, it could weigh on demand in several of Ireland&rsquo;s key export markets, with knock-on implications for Irish exports.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments in Ukraine and the broader spillover effects closely. Indeed a chart-pack containing information on the economic and fiscal impacts of the conflict can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website. Further analysis is set out in the Stability Programme Update, which was published in draft form earlier this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800057#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800057#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[21427\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800057#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the report by the Revenue Commissioners indicating that 641 companies that claimed the &euro;267.8 million in employment wage subsidy scheme also filed for the dividend withholding tax (details supplied); the number of the companies in question that have returned all or part of the value of the subsidy paid to them during the lifetime of the scheme to the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is provided for in section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, as amended and is an economy-wide support. It has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees since July 2020.   The EWSS provides a subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  To date, the EWSS has helped almost 52,000 employers to keep over 734,000 employees in employment since the scheme began in September 2020.  The related cost has been &euro;7.8 billion. <\/p>  <p>  As regards eligibility for the EWSS, an employer must be able to demonstrate that its business has experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.   Furthermore, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.  Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim an EWSS subsidy for that employee. <\/p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy schemes, as provided for in legislation, do not include any conditions related to a company making a distribution to its shareholders.   Thus, there is no impediment to employers paying dividends to its shareholders and this is a business decision for an employer to take based on its financial circumstances.   <\/p>  <p>  Companies making distributions have obligations to deduct and return Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT).  DWT applies to a wide range and different types of distributions.   This includes both intra-group distributions and dividends paid to shareholders, including both cash and non-cash distributions (e.g. distributions made in the form of the issue of additional shareholdings). The DWT return does not distinguish between these different forms of taxable distribution nor does it set out the accounting period to which distributions may relate. Therefore, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to determine whether distribution payments relate to profit reserves earned before or during the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue recently carried out a short exercise to identify DWT returns filed by EWSS claimant companies in respect of distributions made in 2021. This showed that 641 employers, out of a total of 51,900 who received EWSS payments, filed DWT returns advising of some form of distribution during this period.  However, it was not possible to determine whether the distributions were cash or non-cash in nature or whether any dividends were paid to shareholders.   At that time, the 641 companies had received gross EWSS subsidy payments of &euro;267.8m.  19 of these employers have returned all subsidies received totalling &euro;27.9m while 84 have partially repaid EWSS received amounting to &euro; 5.8m.<\/p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that the EWSS was developed as an emergency support to assist businesses in extraordinary circumstances arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. It should also be noted that the majority of companies that have participated in the wage subsidy schemes did so because they had a reasonable expectation that their business would suffer a decline in turnover or customer orders as a result of the effect of the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  Without the support of EWSS, many businesses may not be in existence today or may not have been in a position to adapt as responsively as they have to the reopening of all sectors of our economy.   I am satisfied that the EWSS has operated as a very effective and responsive instrument to aid economic recovery during these unprecedented times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800057#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":181,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800057#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[20563\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800057#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a report on his engagement with the insurance industry to address the difficulties of access to affordable insurance faced by some businesses.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>Insurance reform is a key priority for this Government.

The <i>Action Plan<\/i>sets out 66 actions to protect consumers and improve the businesses environment in the insurance sector.<\/p><p>In terms of engagement, there has been engagement with industry &ndash; both individual insurers and Insurance Ireland &ndash; on an ongoing basis.

These engagements have been positive, with insurers confirming their commitment to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and are adhering to them in their direct settlements. During these meetings, Minister of State Fleming also impressed upon insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover, particularly high-risk\/high-footfall areas.<\/p><p>Another development of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>was the creation of the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance.

Since its establishment, the Office has held over 70 meetings with a wide range of key stakeholders, including representative bodies, providers and other civic society groups, to understand the gaps in the Irish insurance market. The Office has been working closely with the IDA to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve its overall competitiveness. Officials have developed a customised proposition for potential market entrants and have identified a shortlist of specific targets to engage intensively with.

Over 1,900 buildings overall in the category have been identified to be audited. Of these, following initial desk-top surveys, where collating documentary data relating to each building is co-ordinated, approximately 29% of buildings may be excluded i.e. if they are vacant properties, sites or buildings in the process of being released.

These collective agreements have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner. These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.<\/p><p>The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.<\/p><p>The Agreement provides for the following pay adjustments: <\/p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1 October 2021.<\/p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022.  <\/p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.<\/p><p>Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022.

The Agreement commits the parties to &lsquo;prior engagement&rsquo; where assumptions underlying the Agreement need to be revisited. <\/p><p>It should be noted in this context that a number of measures have been agreed by Government in order to mitigate the impact of inflation. The cost of living package announced in February, combined with the earlier Energy Credit announcement, has a value of over half a billion euro. This comprises:  <\/p><p>- A lump sum payment of &euro;125 to recipients of Fuel Allowance to be paid in March;<\/p><p>- An increase in the Energy Credit payment announced in December from &euro;100 exclusive of VAT to &euro;200 inclusive of VAT;  <\/p><p>- Applying the Budget 2022 increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment from April rather than June; <\/p><p>- Further reducing the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold to &euro;80 per month, having been reduced to &euro;100 per month in Budget 2022;  <\/p><p>- Reducing the maximum annual School Transport charge to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year; <\/p><p>- A 20% reduction in PSO Public Transport fares from May until the end of 2022.<\/p><p>Additional measures of a temporary payment of &euro;100 per week for every heavy goods vehicle for licensed hauliers and a further Fuel Allowance lump sum payment of &euro;100 have since also been announced.<\/p><p>These expenditure measures, along with the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil introduced by the Minister for Finance and now extended until Budget day in October 2022, and the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills until end October, amount to &euro;1 billion in aggregate.<\/p><p>In terms of the review of Building Momentum, an initial constructive engagement has already taken place between my officials and ICTU and I am giving consideration the issues raised.

This is part of a fiscal framework that seeks to ensure that the level of spending and overall position of the public finances are sustainable over the medium term. It sees overall core expenditure growing at around 5\u00a0per cent\u00a0per year on average over the period, a rate broadly in line with trend growth rate of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  The average annual growth rate in core current expenditure is just under 4&frac34; per cent. Total capital spending, including that funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, is to grow by an annual average of over 8&frac12; per cent,\u00a0reaching over &euro;13&frac12; billion in 2025. This builds on increased capital investment in recent years, following a period of significant expenditure reductions following the global financial crisis, and provides for increased allocations to key areas such as housing and climate investment. In Budget 2022, core capital spending increased by 11.7% over the 2021 position, allowing for increased allocations to Departments to progress infrastructural investment in line with the revised National Development Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 allocations were in line with the parameters set out in the SES, with &euro;80.1 billion in core expenditure available for 2022 and up to &euro;7&frac12; billion in non-core funding for temporary challenges such as Covid-19 and Brexit. This provides necessary continued supports as we recover from the pandemic while improving core services. <\/p>  <p>  Recent years have seen a number of budgetary reforms implemented, which can aid and enhance our ongoing focus on ensuring value for money from public funds. This continues to be particularly important in light of recent expenditure pressures posed by Covid-19 and now by inflation and the war in Ukraine.\u00a0These reforms includes the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework, the Spending Review process, Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting and the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland. Careful scrutiny on the quality of expenditure and what it delivers for citizens will be necessary to ensure we meet targets, in the context of both the significant level of resources to be provided under the medium term expenditure strategy and the current challenges we face. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800058#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800058#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[21401\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800058#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the works funded by the Office of Public Works on the Womanagh river near Ballymacoda, County Cork within the past 20 years; the amount expended on same to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes and catchment drainage schemes designated under the Arterial Drainage Acts of 1945 and 1995.

These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.<\/p><p>The current public service agreement is\u00a0Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit\u00a0more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.<\/p><p>The Agreement provides for the following pay adjustments:<\/p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever\u00a0is greater,\u00a0on 1 October\u00a02021.<\/p><p>- The equivalent of a 1%\u00a0increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on,\u00a01 October 2022.<\/p><p>Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. As the Deputies will be aware, public service unions and staff representative associations have sought a review of the current Agreement on the grounds that the assumptions regarding inflation, public finances and the projected deficit need to be revisited. The Agreement commits the parties to &lsquo;prior engagement&rsquo; where assumptions underlying the Agreement need to be revisited. <\/p><p>It should be noted in this context that a number of measures have been agreed by Government in order to mitigate the impact of inflation. The cost of living package announced in February, combined with the earlier Energy Credit announcement, has a value of over half a billion euro. This comprises: <\/p><p>- A lump sum payment of &euro;125 to recipients of Fuel Allowance to be paid in March;<\/p><p>- An increase in the Energy Credit payment announced in December from &euro;100 exclusive of VAT to &euro;200 inclusive of VAT;<\/p><p>- Applying the Budget 2022 increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment from April rather than June;<\/p><p>- Further reducing the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold to &euro;80 per month, having been reduced to &euro;100 per month in Budget 2022;<\/p><p>- Reducing the maximum annual School Transport charge to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year;<\/p><p>- A 20% reduction in PSO Public Transport fares from May until the end of 2022.<\/p><p>Additional measures of a temporary payment of &euro;100 per week for every heavy goods vehicle for licensed hauliers and a further Fuel Allowance lump sum payment of &euro;100 have since also been announced.<\/p><p>These expenditure measures, along with the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil introduced by the Minister for Finance and now extended until Budget day in October 2022, and the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills until end October, amount to &euro;1 billion in aggregate.<\/p><p>In terms of the review of Building Momentum, an initial constructive engagement has already taken place between my officials and ICTU and I am giving consideration the issues raised.

Of course, Government acknowledges that current price pressures present particular challenges and are a source of concern - including for public service workers.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to the delivery of quality public services, and will continue to approach public service pay in a balanced way that is reasonable and fair to both public servants and the taxpayer. <\/p><p>It is important to remember that there are multiple challenges facing the economy and the Exchequer, and in this context the public service pay bill needs to be managed in a sustainable way.

The Bill is currently at Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that the Deputy's question relates to the provisions in the Bill that amend section 8 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 (\"the Principal Act\"). These amendments provide that a worker employed by a public body who wishes to make a disclosure to a Minister must first have reported either to their employer under section 6 of the Act or to a prescribed person under section 7 of the Act unless the Head of the public body concerned is directly complicit in the alleged wrongdoing or there is an emergency situation where there is an immediate threat to public health or safety.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asks if this provision breaches the non-regression clause at Article 25.2 of the Whistleblowing Directive. I am advised by the Attorney General that it does not.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Article 25.2 states that: \"The implementation of this Directive shall under no circumstances constitute grounds for a reduction in the level of protection already afforded by Member States in the areas covered by this Directive\". <\/p>  <p>  In literal terms this Article does not outright prevent a Member States from reducing the level of protection already afforded but rather provides that the Directive shall not &ldquo;constitute grounds&rdquo; for such a reduction. In other words, no Member State can rely on the Directive as a justification for reducing the protection and, in particular, for contending that a greater protection is inconsistent with the Directive. That, however, is very different from preventing a Member State, for policy reasons, reducing the level of protection provided no reliance is placed on the Directive in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments to section 8 of the Principal Act proposed in the Bill are\u00a0not changing the rules concerning Ministerial disclosures because of the Directive. The rules are being changed for the simple reason that this channel does not work as intended in its present form. Its operation has been\u00a0one of the most challenging areas of implementation for the Protected Disclosures Act.<\/p>  <p>  The intent behind the provision of a Ministerial channel under the Act was that in the event that a public body failed to deal properly with an internal report, a worker in that public body would have the fall back option of reporting to the Minister. In practice there has been a tendency for reporting persons to either go to the Minister first or report simultaneously to both their employer and the Minister. This practice of simultaneous or near-simultaneous reporting through different channels was raised as a concern by the Disclosures Tribunal, which recommended that the Oireachtas consider amending the legislation, so that when a report is made, the initial recipient is afforded a reasonable amount of time to take action before the reporting person moves on to an alternative channel. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore Article 7.2 of the Directive requires Member States to encourage reporting internally in the first instance. The introduction of a requirement that the reporting person should report using one of the other channels first is intended to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill in many ways is strengthening and professionalising the Ministerial channel by providing that Ministerial disclosures will be referred to an independent expert in the form of the Protected Disclosures Commissioner which will transmit disclosures to appropriate bodies for assessment and follow up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800059#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Lobbying Reform","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800059#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[20547\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800059#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way he proposes to change the laws around lobbying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>At its meeting on 15 February 2022, the Government approved the publication of the General Scheme of the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2022, its referral to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for pre-legislative scrutiny, and the priority drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General. <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme was published on 16 February and contains the legislative proposals to amend certain provisions of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.

The project outputs will provide recommendations for the management of specific catchment types relevant to the Irish environment by quantifying the magnitude of nature-based solutions required to reduce flood peaks and improve downstream water quality by attenuating nutrients.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to co-funding large-scale research, the OPW has contributed to funding community led work. In 2019, a study, carried out by Trinity College Dublin on behalf of Inishowen Rivers Trust and funded by the OPW, to assess the feasibility of implementing nature-based solutions for catchment management at five locations on the Inishowen peninsula was completed. This study was followed by a LEADER funded project to implement nature-based solutions in Clonmany, to which the OPW has committed funding. This project has implemented 69 measures, typically leaky-dams to slow flood peaks, and has involved extensive landowner and community engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW co-chaired a working group with the EPA which was established in 2019 to advise the National Technical Implementation Group of the Water Framework Directive on the use of nature-based solutions to contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives set out in the second River Basin Management Plan. The working group presented their findings in 2020 and the OPW is now part of the steering group for an EPA research project to implement a key recommendation from the working group titled &lsquo;Integrated Framework for River Restoration and Nature-based Solutions for Integrated Catchment Management&rsquo;. The aim of this project is to develop a decision support framework to identify appropriate measures for restoring rivers and implementing nature-based solutions for integrated catchment management that would work to restore impacted surface waters.<\/p>  <p>  The development of flood relief schemes under the OPW&rsquo;s capital programme now involves a specific requirement to assess the potential for nature-based solutions as part of the overall solution to managing flood risk for a particular community. Where feasible, these measures will be implemented to reduce flood risk and contribute to achieving co-benefits such as water quality improvement, habitat creation, and climate change adaption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800059#WRF05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":330,"content":"<p>Question No. 140 answered with Question No. 116.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[21523\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on a policy issue raised by a person (details supplied) relating to the impact of fast fashion on human rights;

Enhanced\u00a0measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health. It is estimated that each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning and that there are over 16,200 life years lost. In addition, many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. New regulations are a critical element of addressing this public health and environmental challenge and will serve to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.<\/p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process, draft regulations were prepared in the context of initiating an EU Technical Regulations Information consultation process. In recognition of the fact that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands, and to accommodate those with rights to harvest sod peat, the draft regulations as notified, placed no restriction on the cutting or burning of sod peat while seeking to reduce the emissions associated with its use in more urban areas where its use causes the greatest harm. <\/p>  <p>  As with all regulatory consultations, submissions made during the course of this process will inform the final regulations. These will ultimately be agreed by Government and will ensure, that while measures are introduced to enhance the quality of our air, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hedge Cutting","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[21567\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a landowner who has cleaned their overgrown hedgeways can burn the old debris from the hedgeways; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>Under the Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) Regulations 2009, the burning of household, garden, commercial or industrial waste is not permitted.<\/p><p>An exemption is provided\u00a0in the legislation to allow farmers, as a last resort and when no alternatives are available,\u00a0to dispose of green waste\u00a0generated by agricultural practices, by burning.

In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of energy poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of energy poverty when energy prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their energy needs increases.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. The Government has also put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year to address the increasing cost of energy including:<\/p>  <p>  - Following on from the Budget 2022 increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March. <\/p>  <p>  - All residential electricity customers will see the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200 (incl. VAT) credited to their accounts. <\/p>  <p>  - The National Retrofit Scheme includes specific measures to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation. <\/p>  <p>  To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, has also announced a number of additional supports for consumers and businesses including:<\/p>  <p>  - A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  - A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.<\/p>  <p>  - A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.<\/p>  <p>  - The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.<\/p>  <p>  - An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  - The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, the electricity and gas markets, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.<\/p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will\u00a0be completed in the coming weeks to inform future policy in this area.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Quality","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[21640\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the water quality in lakes (details supplied) in County Cavan is being actively monitored; if so, if he will provide details of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>Neither I nor my Department have any role with regard to water quality, statutory responsibility for which comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.I am advised that\u00a0the EPA are the key statutory body responsible for the monitoring of water bodies, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities.<\/p><p>The EPA is an independent public body established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and is entirely independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Quality","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG04900"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[21641\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800060#WRG05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the additional measures that will be introduced to prevent the supply of a product in this State (details supplied) in view of the widespread concerns of merchants regarding the availability of this product; when such measures will be introduced; if local authorities are responsible for such enforcement action; if they will be resourced appropriately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>The new solid fuel regulations due to be enacted this Autumn will place\u00a0technical standards and restrictions on all solid fuels.

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy\u00a0will be\u00a0aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have\u00a0collectively contributed\u00a0to increased take up\u00a0of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base in 2017, to over 56,000 now.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am acutely aware that the cost of\u00a0electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers and that\u00a0 supply chain issues globally have also proven difficult. These have been exacerbated by international events. For these reasons, our policy measures here are kept under continuous review.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is at the beginning of its transition to private electric transport. Within a few years I anticipate there will be\u00a0a viable second hand market that will provide a more affordable pathway to the purchase of an EV. In addition, the motor industry is planning to bring more affordable electric vehicles onto the market.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, I am taking steps to accelerate the establishment of a second hand EV market in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department convened the\u00a0Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group\u00a0to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This\u00a0Group\u00a0considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption. The\u00a0Group\u00a0also examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles and found that parity in respect of the Total Cost of Ownership is likely to be achieved later on this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A cross-departmental\u00a0Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures and barriers to the adoption of the EVs. It will also examine\u00a0the creation of a second hand\u00a0market.\u00a0This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work\u00a0is underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland as a matter of priority.

Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8, 7 and 7.4 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area respectively in March. <\/p>  <p>  The rise in wholesale energy prices is the key contributor and reflects the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Price spikes have been seen in a range of other commodities as well, including food, fertilisers and metals. Global supply chain disruptions, including the availability of inputs and transport bottlenecks, have also added to inflationary pressures. Domestically, the speed and strength of the economic recovery has led to an imbalance between demand and supply and put additional upward pressure on both wages and prices.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, energy prices increases will continue to be a key driver over the coming months. Inflation is now expected to peak at around 6&frac34; per cent in the second quarter and average 6&frac14; per cent for the year as a whole. Pass-through price effects are expected in other sectors such as food (via higher fuel\/fertiliser costs) and consumer goods and services (due to higher energy inputs), and will add to core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, this year. Core inflation is expected to average 3.9 per cent for 2022 as a whole. <\/p>  <p>  However, given the uncertain and evolving nature of the conflict, the margin of uncertainty around these projections is significant. For this reason, my Department also published a scenario analysis in the Stability Programme Update, in which wholesale oil and gas prices return to their early-March levels and remain elevated relative to baseline this year and next. In this scenario, inflation would be 2 percentage points higher this year and peak at around 9&frac14; per cent in the third quarter.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the impact of rising prices on households and businesses and has introduced a series of measures in recent months at a cost of over &euro;2 billion to help address the rising cost of living. This included a reduction in the VAT rate to 9 per cent for electricity and gas to end-October, an additional once-off lump sum payment in respect of the fuel allowance, a reduction in the PSO levy, an extension of the reduction in excise duty to mid-October and a &euro;200 electricity credit for all households. However, it must be stressed that resources are limited; the priority is to minimise the impact on those who are most affected; the Government can help, but cannot fully insulate all from the burden of higher energy prices.<\/p>  <p>  Given the current dynamics at play, we must remain prudent in our approach &ndash; conscious that broad fiscal measures at this point in time could lead to further inflationary pressure which would be counterproductive in nature.

However the onset of the war in Ukraine fundamentally altered the economic outlook, representing a large supply-side shock to the global economy. \u00a0While the war is expected to slow the economic recovery, it is importantly not expected to de-rail it. <\/p>  <p>  The primary channel through which the conflict will impact on the Irish economy is via elevated energy and other commodity prices. Higher prices will undermine the profitability of business, with costs rising in both the Irish manufacturing and services sectors. However, higher inflation is not only affecting the competitiveness of businesses in Ireland, but is also impacting on the competitiveness of businesses in most advanced economies, with the euro area, the US, and the UK all recording multi-decade high inflation in March. <\/p>  <p>  In the Stability Programme Update, published earlier this month, my Department projected inflation to peak at an average rate of 6&frac34; per cent in the second quarter, before easing slightly over the rest of the year. Inflation is expected to moderate next year but remain at an elevated level, although risks to inflation are tilted firmly to the upside. <\/p>  <p>  As it stands, Ireland remains in a competitive position. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the distorting effects of globalisation, is in a very strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term.

Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 7.4 per cent in March. The rise in wholesale energy prices is the key contributor and reflects the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. <\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, energy prices increases will continue to feed into higher inflation over the coming months. The war has also led to a spike in the price of other commodities while further impairing global supply chains. Pass-through price effects are therefore expected in other sectors, such as food via higher fertiliser and fuel costs for instance, as well as other goods. Inflation is now expected to peak at around 6&frac34; per cent in the second quarter and average 6&frac14; per cent for the year as a whole. While inflation will remain elevated throughout 2022, inflation is expected to ease next year and average 3 per cent in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the impact of rising prices on households and businesses and has accordingly introduced a series of measures in recent months at a cost of over &euro;2 billion. Firstly, Budget 2022 contained a combined income tax and social welfare package amounting to almost &euro;1.1 billion. A suite of measures was then introduced in mid-February, amounting to around &euro;500 million, including an energy credit of &euro;200 to every household in the country and a once-off lump sum payment of the fuel allowance. In March, Government announced reductions in excise duty of 20 cent per litre for petrol and 15 cent per litre for diesel. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month we announced further measures amounting to almost &euro;200 million.

Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of the relevant Group Threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess.\u00a0 In the case of long-term cohabitants who are not related, the relevant Group Threshold is the Group C threshold, which is currently &euro;16,250.\u00a0 In addition to this, a CAT exemption may be available in relation to certain gifts and inheritances between long-term cohabitants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, where a cohabitant inherits the family home from his or her deceased partner, he or she may be in a position to avail of the dwelling house exemption.\u00a0 To qualify for the exemption, the inherited property must have been the deceased cohabitant&rsquo;s principal private residence at the date of his or her death. This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person left the property before the date of death due to ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home. In addition, the inheriting cohabitant must not have a beneficial interest in another residential property. The inheriting cohabitant must also have lived in the house for 3 years prior to the date of the inheritance and must continue to live in the house for 6 years after that date.\u00a0 Detailed guidance on the dwelling house exemption has been published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/capital-acquisitions-tax\/cat-part24.pdf. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the dwelling house exemption, gifts and inheritances taken by a qualified cohabitant in accordance with a court order made under Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 are exempt from CAT. Part 15 of that Act provides for a redress scheme whereby court orders can be obtained in certain circumstances in relation to the transfer of property. A &ldquo;qualified cohabitant&rdquo; is a person who has been in a committed and loving relationship with another person for a minimum period of 5 years (or 2 years where they are parents of one or more dependent children), whose relationship has ended due to death or separation and neither of whom was married to and living with another person in 4 of the 5 years immediately prior to the end of the relationship. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to couples who are long-term cohabitants, it is important to note that differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples arise from the objective of dealing with different circumstances. Under the law, couples who have obtained legal recognition of their relationship status through marriage or civil partnership are not in an analogous situation to other cohabiting couples, which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.\u00a0 Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. <\/p>  <p>  Further information on the taxation of cohabiting couples can be found on the Revenue website, available at www.revenue.ie\/en\/life-events-and-personal-circumstances\/marital-status\/cohabiting-couples\/index.aspx.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800061#WRH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[21637\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will remove the VAT on automated external defibrillators, replacement pads and batteries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department are currently reviewing the options now available to Ireland in setting VAT rates.

These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and<\/p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I appreciate that a greater level of sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.\u00a0 Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will, among other issues, consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[21643\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will consider making the Covid pandemic bonus available to all other sectors that were dealing directly with the public during lockdown.","asker":"1580","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>I want to acknowledge the contribution made by people across our society to the response to the COVID pandemic over the last two years.\u00a0 Their continued contribution is key to enable us to navigate our way through the various challenges the pandemic has presented.<\/p><p>Government was keen to acknowledge these contributions.

This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector.\u00a0 The OGP has published the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and  Services on its website www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/c23f5-public-procurement-guidelines-for-goods-and-services\/\u00a0to\u00a0provide a comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement regulations. The guidelines are designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the\u00a0application of the public procurement rules to deliver best value for money.\u00a0 There is a section specifically dedicated to managing contracts contained within the guidelines\u00a0which outlines the importance of active management by contracting authorities of contracts to maximise value for money.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the time required to administer the procurement process, for contracts above the EU thresholds, minimum time-limits are set down for the different stages of the particular contract award procedure chosen in the 2016 Regulations. Under the 2016 Regulations, the statutory minimum time limits by which suppliers have to respond to advertised procurements and submit tender documents have been reduced by approximately one third when compared with the previous rules. This flexibility speeds up simpler or off-the-shelf procurements, but still permits longer timescales for requirements where tenderers need more time to provide detailed  responses. The time limits in the 2016 Regulations are minimum time limits and contracting authorities should take\u00a0 into account the complexity of the tender and the volume or complexity of information that the tenderers are required to submit when setting any time limits.\u00a0 The timelines for the different procurement procedures can be found in Appendix V of the above mentioned Procurement Guidelines.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Currently inflation is being driven by external global factors which is impacting all sectors of the economy.\u00a0 As the rate of inflation remains elevated, prices are likely to rise.\u00a0 This is particularly significant in a contract which operates for a number of years.\u00a0The impact of inflation over the duration of the contract must be taken into account if the contract is to be successfully delivered.\u00a0 Whether that risk is borne by the supplier or the contracting authority or shared between them is determined by the conditions of contract.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the volatility in the price of construction materials and being mindful of the impact that may have on the delivery of the NDP, in particular the capacity of contractors to bear the risk of inflation, I introduced amendments to the Public Works Contracts in January 2022 that are aimed at sharing the risk of materials price inflation.

This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.<\/p><p>In order to achieve this, my Department has introduced two key reforms:<\/p><p>- The introduction of an External Assurance Process (EAP) for projects over &euro;100m which will provide independent project scrutiny at key\u00a0decision stages. <\/p><p>- A new Major Projects\u00a0Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. <\/p><p>These reforms, alongside ongoing engagement with the construction sector regarding capacity and innovation, will support the\u00a0effective delivery of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Transport","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[21617\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to convert the ministerial allocation of vehicles to electric vehicles.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question my department has no role in relation to this matter.\u00a0As you may be aware, under Section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, including the management of the Garda fleet and all decisions related to the needs of the fleet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[21657\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps he is taking to trial natural flood management as part of flood relief schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[21658\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of trees that have been planted as part of each flood relief scheme nationally since 1 January 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has been engaged in a number of activities to assess and develop nature-based solutions to flood risk management.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, a four-year research project, under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) research programme, titled &lsquo;A Strategic Look at Natural Water Retention Measures&rsquo; (SLOWWATERS) commenced. This ongoing research has a budget of &euro;508,000 and is co-funded by the OPW and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. The research will assess the benefits of nature-based solutions for agricultural catchments in Ireland. The project outputs will provide recommendations for the management of specific catchment types relevant to the Irish environment by quantifying the magnitude of nature-based solutions required to reduce flood peaks and improve downstream water quality by attenuating nutrients.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to co-funding large-scale research, the OPW has contributed to funding community led work. In 2019, a study carried out by Trinity College Dublin on behalf of the Inishowen Rivers Trust, and funded by the OPW, to assess the feasibility of implementing nature-based solutions for catchment management at five locations on the Inishowen peninsula was completed. This study was followed by a LEADER funded project to implement nature-based solutions in Clonmany, to which the OPW has committed funding. This project has implemented 69 measures, typically leaky-dams to slow flood peaks, and has involved extensive landowner and community engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW co-chaired a working group with the EPA which was established in 2019 to advise the National Technical Implementation Group of the Water Framework Directive on the use of nature-based solutions, to contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives set out in the second River Basin Management Plan cycle. The working group presented their findings in 2020 and the OPW is now part of the steering group for an EPA research project to implement a key recommendation from the working group entitled &lsquo;Integrated Framework for River Restoration and Nature-based Solutions for Integrated Catchment Management&rsquo;. The aim of this project is to develop a decision support framework to identify appropriate measures for restoring rivers and implementing nature-based solutions for integrated catchment management that would work to restore impacted surface waters.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW focuses on providing protection against extreme floods, such as the 100-year flood, which cause the most significant damage to communities, and there may be very limited, if any, benefit from natural flood risk measures during such events. Upstream retention is a measure that would have been considered for all schemes and is a feature of a number of recently completed or planned schemes, such as for Clonakilty, and also on the Wad and Poddle rivers in Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  The development of flood relief schemes under the OPW&rsquo;s capital programme now involves a specific requirement to assess the potential for nature-based solutions as part of the overall solution to managing flood risk for a particular community. Where feasible, these measures will be implemented to reduce flood risk and contribute to achieving co-benefits such as water quality improvement, habitat creation, and climate adaptation.<\/p>  <p>  While the information on the number of trees planted in not available at this time, in terms of tree planting for flood relief schemes, the OPW together with the local authorities, that are the lead for many flood relief schemes, both minimise the number of tress to be removed and ensure compensatory tree planting as part of the project landscaping.<\/p>  <p>  The design of all flood relief schemes involves an extensive series of environmental assessments. The design of the schemes and the construction methodology are developed to minimise the impact on the environment, including trees. Where warranted, tree surveys are carried out to identify individual trees that are to be removed and supporting surveys are carried out, such as bat surveys if there is potential value for the bat habitat. \u00a0To complete the project, typically a landscape plan is developed which sets out a planting plan, including for native trees as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800062#WRJ05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":506,"content":"<p>Question No. 202 answered with Question No. 201.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800063#WRK00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800063#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[21521\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800063#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the amount of fees or payments provided to social media influencers, media personalities and retired sportspersons, respectively, by Sport Ireland, in each of the years from 2018 to 2021 and to date in 2022; the names of the persons who received fees; the amount they received; the analytics and-or online metrics related to each project that such a person was engaged on; and the title of the project they were engaged for.","asker":"1489","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>I\u00a0have referred the Deputy's question to Sport Ireland for direct reply with details of the fees or payments made by Sport Ireland as requested by the Deputy.

This is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers which means that teachers on the post-2011 pay scale will reach point 11 of the pay scale in a far shorter time than teachers on the pre-2011 pay scales. The agreement states that parties agree that these measures will be implemented to resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Building Momentum also provides for a sectoral bargaining process to deal with outstanding adjudications, commitments, recommendations, awards and claims which may include allowances. The teaching unions have decided to use this fund to settle outstanding claims including some related to new entrants such as the restoration of a Professional Masters in Education allowance to new entrant teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800064#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800064#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[21648\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800064#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if assistance will be provided for a sector (details supplied) in view of increased costs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel\/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, Divigel was received by the wholesaler on 25th March and was released for sale the following week. An alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently gone short and is expected to resume supply in late April\/early May. In the interim, the company is working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within their regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that they are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. The HPRA are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800066#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800066#WRN01625"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[21512\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800066#WRN01650","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost per adult between 18 and 23 years of age on the step down programme.

A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. &euro;65 million of this budget is available to LAGs who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level.\u00a0 This allocation covers both core project expenditure and the administration and animation costs of the LAGs. <\/p>  <p>  On 9 April last year, my Department released the individual LAG allocations for the transitional period. These enhanced allocations provided certainty to all LAGs and their Implementing Partners for profiling their administration, animation and project expenditure for 2021 and 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In situations where the LAGs administration and animation allocations are utilised, I approved additional funding in this area, subject to a maximum monthly contribution from the Exchequer, the limits of which were also notified to each LAG at that time.\u00a0 This notification outlined the specific arrangements with regards to administration and animation Exchequer funding for LAGs. As these amounts notified\u00a0are the maximum monthly contribution from the Exchequer, LAGs and their Implementing Partners were advised to review their administration and animation expenditure requirements so as to ensure that they are able to operate within their allocated budgets and to take corrective action in advance where required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, should the Kildare LAG utilise all its administration and animation programme funding, my Department will be providing a maximum monthly contribution of &euro;24,359 from the Exchequer towards the administration and animation costs incurred. This contribution is based on the average monthly administration and animation allocation over the period July 2016 to December 2020 as outlined to the LAGs in April 2021. There is no provision for this level of funding to be increased.<\/p>  <p>  The process of finalising the arrangements for the new LEADER programme is ongoing in consultation with the EU Commission and stakeholders.\u00a0 This process will include arrangements for the allocation of funding across LEADER areas under the new LEADER programme.\u00a0 The draft CAP Strategic Plan includes an allocation of &euro;180m for the new LEADER programme for the period 2023-2027.\u00a0 This brings the total allocation for the 2021-2027 period to &euro;250m, which maintains the LEADER allocation from the previous 2014-2020 programming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022042800067#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
