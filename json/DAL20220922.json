These supports include the electric small public service vehicles, eSPSV, grant scheme to which I allocated &euro;15 million this year and which supports drivers in their transition to zero- or low-emission vehicles.  The eSPSV business loan provided by Microfinance Ireland is also there to support those SPSV owners accessing the eSPSV grant scheme who are unable to secure finance from financial institutions.  The Government's generally applicable reduction in fuel-related duties introduced this year has also helped.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA's previous extensions of the maximum permissible age for vehicles ensured no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.  The NTA launched a driver recruitment campaign this summer to promote the sector as a place of employment for people.  The NTA recently announced new fares, which are weighted in favour of those drivers working at unsocial hours, late at night and on bank holidays.  In addition, this week the NTA announced a public consultation on a further extension to the maximum permissible age of vehicles in recognition of the difficulties currently being experienced by operators in sourcing new vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the transfer of licences is currently prohibited under the legislation.  However, there are exceptions provided in the case of the death of a licence holder and that licence holder has previously nominated another individual to operate the licence.

Our ambitious vision for rural Ireland, which involves reduced car dependency and a more integrated transport network, is a key motivator for my Department as it prepares the work programme for 2023.  The Department and the NTA are supporting this by providing increased funding for enhanced TFI Local Link services for both regular timetabled services and door-to-door demand responsive services.  Additionally, we are looking to explore alternative options to boost coverage by non-conventional options such as demand responsive transport, community cars and local hackney areas.  Importantly, the ethos of community-led transport will also be maintained.  We are looking to expand the highly successful community car scheme.

There are still gaps, however, in terms of how it actually facilitates people living in rural Ireland.  Those gaps need to be addressed.  For example, a person living in Donegal town who wants to work in Killybegs cannot rely on public transport to do so because there is not an integrated service.  That needs to happen.  The routes need to facilitate people to get to where they are travelling.  We see the number of cars that are travelling from Donegal to Killybegs every morning.  Some of those people could be accommodated on buses if the buses were actually responsive to the needs people have.  That is what needs to be looked at to ensure it works.  We must also have an integrated ticketing system that actually works with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link so that they all work together rather than what we seem to have, which is disparate systems of transport around the area.

That is important to recognise.  I also agree with the Deputy about the real benefit and strength of Local Link and the strong roots it has going back with community organisations and working with other State organisations.  The funding has gone from &euro;12 million in 2016 to &euro;29 million this year.  There has, therefore, been recognition of that.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I am very keen to support further innovation.  As part of the process in which we are engaged at the moment, and in which I am sure Deputy Pringle must have been engaged in his own county, we are looking at what routes might be the best to develop.  That consultation process is appropriate so people identify the issues.  I can well imagine the traffic from Donegal town to Killybegs in the morning.  We are being open and flexible in looking at new Connecting Ireland routes to try to identify where there is unmet demand and whether we can change the routes to meet it.

It is a case of putting on the service and giving it time to build so it can meet the needs of communities rather than waiting for the needs to be there and then providing a service.  That will not happen and it will not work in that way.  What that will do is foster car dependency, which is what we have in County Donegal.  One must be car dependent because one cannot rely on anything else.  If a person is relying on Bus &Eacute;ireann to get to work in Killybegs, he or she must leave Donegal town at 7.30 a.m. and will not get back again until 7.30 p.m. or later.

The assessment report undertaken by the NTA was published as a background paper to the draft transport strategy for the GDA at the end of 2021.  It considered the strategic rationale for such a rail link, assessed rail and bus options, examined potential alignments of a rail link, and provided a high-level assessment of cost and demand.  The wider appraisal, which examined the qualitative and quantitative benefits of the Navan rail line, has shown that the scheme has the potential to deliver significant economic, environmental and social benefits along the Dublin-Navan corridor.  On the basis of the assessment, the provision of a rail line extension to Navan is included within the draft long-term strategy for transport in the GDA, for delivery and opening at a point after 2030.  The strategy is in draft form and it is therefore premature to comment on precise delivery timelines, costs and benefits at this stage.  The strategy is subject to a formal statutory approval process and a final version is expected to be submitted from the NTA for my approval in the coming weeks.

In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, the total capital funding allocated to the Department for investment in 2022 is &euro;2.547 billion.  As of the end of August 2022, &euro;926.116 million in capital was profiled for expenditure and &euro;707 million was issued. The variance was &euro;219.110 million.  In addition, &euro;155.043 million of unspent capital was carried over from last year, of which &euro;151.238 million was issued.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly summarise the expenditure profile for each programme.  Under programme A, sustainable mobility, active travel and greenways, expenditure is &euro;86.572 million compared to profile of &euro;62.856 million, or 38% ahead of profile.  Under programme B, sustainable mobility, carbon reduction and public transport, taking electric vehicle, EV, and EV infrastructure grants first, expenditure is &euro;50.425 million, compared to profile of &euro;63.034 million, or 12% behind profile.  Expenditure is &euro;165.856 million for heavy rail and public transport investment compared to profile of &euro;271.148 million, or 39% behind profile.  Under programme C, road safety and road networks, expenditure is &euro;402.068 million compared to profile of &euro;526.617 million, or 24% behind profile.  Under programme D, civil aviation, expenditure is on profile, with no expenditure scheduled to take place prior to the fourth quarter.  Under programme E, maritime transport and safety, expenditure is &euro;1.311 million, compared to profile of &euro;1.647 million, or 20% behind profile.<\/p>  <p>  For subheads with underspends, the reasons for variations between expenditure and profile are as follows: in grants and infrastructure, the LEV grants provide funding towards several EV purchase grants, which are demand led.  In general, demand was lower than expected at this point in the year due to global supply chain issues impacting on the availability and delivery of new vehicles into the Irish market.  The drawdown of funding for infrastructure is also being impacted by global supply chains.  In addition, the launch of a scheme for apartment charging had been delayed and was launched with Zero Emissions Vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, on 21 July.  Under heavy rail safety and development, the underspend is predominantly due to the reduction in spend on DART+ fleet because of a renegotiation of the timing of milestone payments, with a significant down payment made to Alstom in December last year, which had originally been scheduled for this year.  There is also a reduction in expenditure on new Intercity railcars due to an updated delivery schedule of 2023 for the majority of railcars.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of public transport infrastructure, the underspend is predominantly due to a reduction in spend on ticketing, technology and integration, support and the bus programme.  In the case of BusConnects Dublin, there have been delays to the delivery of new fleet.  In construction and development of national roads, some of the underspend relates to the timing of payments.  Regarding significant project delay, as Roadbridge Ltd. went into receivership in March, leading to the N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge project being suspended. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in the area of regional roads, expenditure to end August on protection and renewal of regional and local roads was close to profile while expenditure on road improvement projects was behind profile.  The shortfall in expenditure for road improvement projects is due largely to the impact of the Roadbridge receivership on the Coonagh to Knockalisheen distribution road project.  <\/p>  <p>  I will not read out the rest of this reply, but I would make the point that those underspends at this present time will be clawed back.  We will not have a significant underspend at the end of the year.  There are a number of additional rail and public transport projects that we expect to deliver and spend on in this year, which will mean that those underspends will not accrue at the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200007#E01300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.

As I mentioned earlier, thankfully there is a growth in population in rural areas.  My own county is very rural and there is few national roads because of our Border situation.  We are heavily dependent on the non-national network for the siting of people&rsquo;s homes and enterprise and business.  There is a lot of heavy traffic and we need to ensure that for the roads, which are at a reasonable standard at the moment, there is investment in those to protect the investment that was made over the years.  Many roads in both counties are crying out for investment and upgrading.  In this day and age, people are entitled to a proper standard of road to their home and to their place of work.

We must ensure that is protected, which it has been in recent budgets.  <\/p> <p> The reality is that there are so many different asks, as we heard earlier, particularly in respect of new services connecting Ireland, including new rail services.  We still have a significant shift to make.  We are heading, as a Government, towards a ratio of 2:1 expenditure on public transport compared to roads.  We are not anywhere near that yet.  The significant increases in transport spending to come are going to be on public transport to make sure that we have options.  Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, O'Rourke and others said earlier that critical public transport projects need funding.

It means that a trainload of commuters can be left stranded when it is late.  I would appreciate attention being given to that issue.<\/p>  <p>  My question today concerns the Go-Ahead bus routes, primarily the 120 bus, which serves Clane and Edenderry, the 115 on the Kilcock side and the 126 on the Naas side.

These contractual arrangements allow for not just the monitoring of performance by the authority and the publication by it of annual performance reports, but importantly, the contracts also allow for the imposition of financial penalties where performance does not meet the required standard.  It is the case that operators in the public transport sector are experiencing difficulties with staffing both as a result of Covid-related absences and also difficulties in recruiting new drivers.  However, it is also the case that Go-Ahead Ireland is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences at present resulting in a knock-on effect on service delivery, with some services not operating as scheduled.  In addition, last week the company notified the NTA of a cybersecurity alert that resulted in major difficulties in communicating rosters to drivers across the Go-Ahead group internationally, including Ireland, causing a number of additional service cancellations across the Go-Ahead Ireland network, over and above those associated with general driver shortages.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the NTA&rsquo;s performance monitoring system, poor reliability and punctuality performance results in financial penalties.  I am informed that these matters will be discussed between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland at their forthcoming quarterly review meeting.  As I said in reply to Deputy O'Rourke earlier, the Deputy may wish to be aware that penalties were previously applied to Go-Ahead Ireland for quarter 4 of 2021 and quarter 1 of 2022, amounting to &euro;266,968 and &euro;209,188, respectively.  The NTA formally meets Go-Ahead Ireland on a weekly basis to review performance, associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans, and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F00700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The difficulty here is that there were issues with services, and the 120 in particular, pre-Covid and pre-Go-Ahead.  In fact, it was considered by the regular commuters on the bus that the service would improve and there was a bit of excitement about it.  I replied to some representations at the time saying that there was light at the end of the tunnel because a new operator was coming on board and the service would improve.  That was the assumption.  There is great frustration and disappointment that rather than improving, it has gone backwards.  I am aware that the NTA had imposed penalties.  Perhaps it will consider further penalties.  I welcome that.  If a carrot-and-stick approach needs to be applied, so be it.  That is all well and good.  However, it is almost a year on now.  I appreciate that coming out of Covid there were difficulties with recruitment and all the rest of it, but we have been hearing about staff and driver issues for 12 months now.  Surely, a properly organised, managed and regulated company can get to grips with such issues within 12 months, rather than having them persistently drag on.  Perhaps, in my reply, I will give some examples of how people are affected.  I appreciate that the NTA is in talks, but perhaps those talks need to be escalated and expedited, because it really needs to get this moving, in every sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.  As I said earlier, if companies are not delivering on the terms of the contract and the service level agreements, there have to be consequences.  The NTA has that stick with which to impose fines.  The operators that cannot meet service standards cannot expect that they will retain and continue to provide services on particular routes.  It is a problem.  There is an issue right across all public transport companies and the various sectors of the economy.  We know about the issues with getting full employment and the real difficulty in getting trained staff in.  It is a real problem.  However, that cannot just be allowed to continue.  We have to examine it and intervene.  I mentioned earlier that Go-Ahead Ireland is taking driver applications at present.  One of the key issues that we have to examine is the training apprenticeship model.  As I understand it, Dublin Bus has a more traditional apprenticeship-type system, where candidates are taken in and right through.  I will say to the NTA that we must look at the apprenticeship and other training models to ensure we have the drivers we need, and not just accept the shortage as an ongoing reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F00900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>That is a very good idea.  It makes perfect sense to do that, rather than having some casual labour being brought in for a route here or there and being let go again.  Having an apprenticeship model as a career path is the way to go.  Perhaps the Minister can point the NTA towards that because the driver shortage is across the board.  I will share a few examples with the Minister.  I have had multiple representations to my office over the past year.  One example concerns a local business that has taken on a Ukrainian refugee, who has been placed in local accommodation with a family.  The refugee is cycling to the nearest bus stop and then getting a bus to the beauty salon in which she has been employed.  Unfortunately, the business is in the position of almost having to let her go because she cannot get to work on time.  The business is doing its best to accommodate her.  She is great and everything else is working, but she cannot get there on time.  Another lady told me that she commutes home in the evening from Dublin.  She feels very vulnerable standing at bus stops late at night in Dublin city centre.  She cannot guarantee that the bus will arrive on time.  She is waiting for the bus on the quays, sometimes for long periods.  Indeed, she told me that she waited four hours one night for a bus to turn up.  This is not a safe or sustainable situation.  On a practical level, the real-time app that should tell people when the bus is late only flags it when the bus is already late.  I experienced that myself this morning on the train.  The real-time app only updates at the end.  If the real-time bus app told passengers that it was late half an hour or an hour beforehand, they could stay in work or go for a coffee, rather than waiting and finding out what they already know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F01000","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mark Ward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F01100","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Does the Minister not have a response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F01200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Deputy Donnelly has a related question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200008#F01300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1663836600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The use of public transport depends on the confidence of its users in the delivery of a reliable service.

The solution to these problems is increased public transport and providing the priority for public transport.

There are difficulties on particular routes, and we will look at them, but the public is responding.  Where we have started to introduce the BusConnects routes in Dublin, including the H-spine and the Lucan spine, the evidence is that it is working.  The numbers are shooting up.  It is a virtuous process we can get into.  Some services in Dublin, including the Luas, are not back to the numbers they carried previously.

As Deputies are aware, as part of budget 2022, I secured &euro;25 million in funding for the introduction of a young adult card.  It is my firm view that the young adult card will be of great benefit to young adults and will not only promote modal shift among that cohort of the population, but also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with the associated benefit of transport emission savings.<\/p>  <p>  The young adult card was initially introduced on public service obligation services in May.  Since then there has been extensive engagement between my Department, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and representatives from the commercial bus sector to agree upon extending the initiative to commercial bus operators as well.  That extension has now been agreed and has been in place since 4 September, so the 50% fare discount for holders of a young adult - those aged 19 to 23 - or student Leap card is now available on bus services provided by participating commercial bus operators.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question on the eligibility requirements for the young adult card, I am happy to clarify that the NTA is widening the age rules of the scheme to allow 16-, 17-, and 18-year-old students in third level education to apply for the student leap card so that they can also avail of the discount.  This is in line with the approach that has been taken with mature students who are in full-time third level education.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the NTA has already commenced the technical work on this matter, which is scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point those third level students aged 16, 17, and 18 will be able to order a student Leap card and avail of the discount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200010#H00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1663837800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>That is fantastic news.

Right now, 18-year-old students are not eligible for either the Leap card for 19- to 24-year-olds or the student Leap card.  Therefore, they have to get a child ticket.  If they are, for example, travelling from Drogheda to Dublin to attend college, then they are paying double the fee of their 19-year-old classmate because a child's single fare on that route is &euro;10 versus &euro;5 under the new discounted Leap card for 19- to 24-year-olds.  That is double the price.  It is an anomaly, it is not fair and it is not in the spirit of what the Minister introduced in order to reduce the dependency on cars, to change people's behaviours and to help students deal with the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's answer that this is an anomaly he and the NTA are committed to fixing.

Again, we would like it to move as quickly as possible on 16-, 17- and 18-year-olds being able to avail of the Leap card.  Does this mean they will get the exact same as a 19-year-old would get, from a financial point of view, from the young adult card?  Beyond that, there is an anomaly here in that this Leap card is only available to people in third level education.

Some 931 applications were received from schools across every county in Ireland.

Subsequently, two schools have deferred their applications and one school has withdrawn, leaving 167 schools in the first round.  It should be noted that all schools that applied to the original call for applications were accepted into the programme and, if not selected in the first round, will be selected for forthcoming rounds.

The area in front of Gl&oacute;r na Mara National School is exceptionally safe at school drop-off and pick-up times but the approaches on Priest's Road and the Ring Road are not necessarily as safe.

This is added to existing supply constraints in electricity markets across Europe, which in turn have led to an unprecedented increase in retail electricity and gas prices for consumers, households and businesses in Ireland and across Europe.  I am very cognisant of the difficulties this is causing for so many.  It is clear the increase in energy prices is leading to windfall gains for some energy companies across Europe, particularly those involved in the production of fossil fuels and those producing energy using technologies that are not dependent on gas.  My officials have been working with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to attempt to quantify such gains and to explore the potential of collecting a portion of these gains to provide support to energy consumers during these very difficult times.<\/p>  <p>  Work in this regard is now focusing on a proposed European Commission regulation, which is under rapid negotiation.  Gains to electricity producers are driven by the market structure, which determines the marginal price paid for each unit of electricity sold.  For this reason, the EU regulation proposes to include an inframarginal price cap in the electricity market, designed to limit windfall revenues for producers that are not experiencing input cost inflation.  The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view to being approved at a meeting of the Council of energy ministers on 30 September.  I fully support the objectives of this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referenced discussions at the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup discussed this matter at its most recent meeting.

By paying electricity generators the cost of the final generator needed to balance demand, typically gas in this instance, lower cost electricity generators are enjoying windfall revenues.  It is increasing the cost for suppliers and prices for households and businesses.  My colleagues have been raising this with the Government since November 2021.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications issued a joint statement opposing any changes to the operation of the wholesale electricity market at that time.  The Minister for Finance himself has voiced on numerous occasions opposition to a tax being levied on electricity generators enjoying windfall profits over the past several months.

I cannot determine the interest rates they charge nor indeed is the Deputy asking me to do that.  I wish to bring to the attention of the House some changes that have occurred in this area.  The interest rates on new mortgages in Ireland are now falling.  For example, in July 2022, which is the latest information available to me, the weighted average interest rate was 2.63%, which is down from 2.69% at the end of 2021 and 2.73% in July 2021.  Most new mortgages in Ireland are now fixed-rate mortgages and the average interest rates on these mortgages of 2.5% at the end of July is a little bit lower. <\/p>  <p>  While I grant that these are only very gradual and moderate changes, they are in the context of change that has been taking place over recent years where we have seen this gradual change occur.  The gap between average Irish and eurozone mortgage interest rates was 1.4% at the end of 2021.  At the end of July, it is now 0.55%.  That gap has narrowed and has changed.  Much could yet happen with those interest rates in the time ahead as the House is aware, but that narrowing has occurred in the recent period due to changes the Deputy is aware of as more fixed-rate products have been accepted by consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200016#O01900","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663841400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, which I fully understand.  Unfortunately for some borrowers in this country it would appear that when the interest rates increase across Europe, we get the benefit of parity with them, but that if they are lower than our interest rates, we do not get parity.  I appreciate all the reasons and understand them fully.  However, under the rules of the Single Market we are entitled to the same as everyone else as it happens, whether we like it or not or whether they like it or not.  As I have mentioned previously, a taxation subcommittee of the Parliament is going around Europe at the moment.  As has been the subject of various discussions, it will seek to impose wealth taxes on inheritance taxes and increase them in a punitive way.  In order to do that, it wants to get control over the financial system and have majority voting apply, in which case it would then determine budgets, taxation etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200016#O02000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1663841400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his steadfast approach to these matters in recent years.

However, national regulators still determine how much capital individual national banks hold, which in turn plays a role in the setting of interest rates in the different jurisdictions.  Other institutions and forces are involved in the setting of interest rates.<\/p>  <p>  I go back to the point I made to the Deputy a moment ago.

Probably one of the biggest issues at the moment, of which I am sure the Minister is only too aware is liability, in particular for the likes of bouncy castles and all the rest of it.

Deputy Farrell made an important point regarding the provision of financial services such as insurance products.  I recognise the work the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has done in this area where he has been making the case for Ireland as a good place for new insurance services to be provided.  He has been successful in supporting and making progress with the availability of insurance products for particular parts of the economy that have been difficult to get.  As Deputy Farrell has outlined, I am well aware of the difficulties we have had in getting insurance in some areas in recent years.  It is very important that we continue to offer an environment in which a wide variety of insurance services are available within the country.  We are also a banking market in which two banks have just left, and we need to be honest in acknowledging the impact that has had and the signals it has sent out about Ireland.  That is why now being vigilant, as the Deputy has just said, regarding competition in the economy and the role the three large banks are going to play in meeting mortgage and lending needs for the economy and people is such an important priority for the Department of Finance and for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CPCC, and the work the Central Bank does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200017#P00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663842000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>We now go back to Question No. 100, which Deputy Carroll MacNeill is taking on behalf of Deputy Colm Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200017#P00500","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","time":1663842000,"counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200017#P00600"},{"type":"question","time":1663842000,"counter":224,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[46185\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200017#P00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to increasing inheritance tax thresholds given the increase in house prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663842000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for facilitating the question, which I am taking on behalf of Deputy Colm Burke.

I sometimes wonder with the reporting of this whether people really understand who is concerned about it and who is bothered by it.  It is as if it is all millionaires and billionaires that are somehow going to benefit from this.  I keep thinking about a woman just off Johnstown Road in my constituency, who has paid off her mortgage with income after tax.  Her husband is a mechanic.  She has not had any change in her car since 2007.  She has two daughters that she has put through college and supported with their education, who are now earning salaries as nurses and working extremely hard in hospitals in Dublin while living in Wicklow.  What she is concerned about is making provision for her family.  It is a very primal sort of concern.  She has said to me she is not a rich woman, she is not flaithi&uacute;lach with her money in any way.  She is a woman who has worked hard.  She has never received nor sought anything from the State.  She has put every penny she has into her family's education and making and providing a home for them.  Her concern now is not her daughters' concern at the point of her death, but her reconciliation with herself that she has made provision for them.  The questions around inheritance tax deeply upset people.  They imagine that there will be some enormous change.  People have a deep, primal feeling about how they make provision for their children, and them being stable, and they are concerned about that.

As people do all of that, they begin to think about their children and other family members.  This is a very important decision for them.  That is why I am pleased to confirm yet again to the Deputy that, in general, I am not planning any significant changes in this area at the moment.  Any detailed matters in regard to this issue, as always, await budget day and the decisions we make.  The point the Deputy makes to me this morning is well made.

It is about being able to give certainty to people at a time of deep uncertainty, which we have had through Covid and that is of unknown duration.  People can cling to something that is certain, which is that they have paid off their mortgage and they know they have done that.  To be able to care for and make provision for their children, but not always other family members, is a very primal concern.  I thank the Minister for his response.

Customers have a responsibility and need to play their role in getting ready for this change but so do the banks, the Central Bank of Ireland and my Department, and we will certainly play our role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200018#Q01000","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","time":1663842600,"counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200018#Q01100"},{"type":"question","time":1663842600,"counter":242,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[46184\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200018#Q01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if financial supports for working from home will be increased given the increase in the cost of utilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","time":1663842600,"counter":243,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[46279\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200018#Q01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he plans to expand remote-working relief in budget 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","time":1663842600,"counter":244,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[46209\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200018#Q01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if financial supports for working from home will be examined given the increase in the cost of utilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663842600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>The question of working from home has taken an unexpected, negative turn in recent months with the rise in energy prices, such as for gas and electricity.

The programme for Government includes a commitment to facilitate and support remote working.  As part of the national remote working strategy, in 2021, the tax strategy group reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers.  That paper is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  Taking into account all these different factors, as announced in budget 2022, the tax arrangements for remote working were enhanced and formalised in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and his or her marginal tax rate.  However, this measure provides some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home.  At the same time, it ensures that the traditional burden of employer-related costs are not transferred from the employer to the State and by doing so, to the wider body of taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, as the current deduction relates to a proportion of the cost of the relevant expenses, the amount that may be claimed will, of course, increase as the value of those expenses increases too.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill referenced a moment ago, the environment regarding working from home has, of course, changed over the past number of months for reasons the House well knows.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies regarding the operation of this policy in the time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200019#R00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663843200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>An interesting point will be interplay between the retention of the deduction and any other changes that Government introduces with regard to energy supports more broadly and how that works out for individuals.  It is extraordinary how external events impact behaviour in a collective way, whether it is the change to remote working and how much that has been of benefit to people, particularly families with children of a young age who have been able to be closer to home, which is so helpful.<\/p>  <p>  Given the increase in energy costs, however, I wonder whether that behaviour will now shift back to the office environment and whether there will be incentives for people to spend more time at work instead of being at home, or what that balance may be in respect of transport costs and the additional costs of leaving a child in childcare for longer rather than being at home to avail of the shared heat and electricity available in office space.  We did not expect the collective move to working from home in advance of the programme for Government.  As the Minister said, we had hoped to provide it in the programme to enable that more but we did not expect the effect in that way.

We must accept as a State that working from home which, for want of better English, was a by-product of Covid-19, has such huge benefits.  We want to make sure that when the State reflects on the paper on the Department's website, but also as we look at the policy and go into the budget next week, we strengthen what the State can do in support.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister made the point that he did not want the cost of remote working for private industry coming back on to the State.  However, if we take it in the round and consider the enormous benefit it has had to individuals, communities and people who have been able to relocate to rural areas and who continue to live in rural areas and work from home, there have been significant benefits to society.  The Minister really needs to look at that in the round.

A very fortunate several hundred thousand people got to stay home on what was a wet and horrible morning while more than 2 million people got into their cars or on trains, bicycles or otherwise to go to work, school or third-level institutions.  As other Members said, this is about harnessing what Covid-19 brought us, which I believe to be of benefit, that is, the huge number of people who stayed at home and reduced their transport costs, reduced congestion and reduced their carbon footprint.  I support any measure the Government can take to enhance that, particularly against the backdrop of rising energy costs.<\/p>  <p>  Anecdotally, I was in the UK during the summer and spoke to a number of extended family members who all said the same thing.  Their energy bills are predicted to double, triple and quadruple, and they will spend more time the office over the winter.  Of course, that is understandable step.

It is probably a little too early to know what the equilibrium will look like in terms of working from home.  Even if we did not have the energy price change that is occurring and we were living in - to use that phrase we used for a long time - a \"new normal\", I still think it would be early to see what the new patterns will be regarding where work will take place.  The world of work is undergoing so much change at the moment, not just due to the effects of Covid-19 but due to the fact that so many employers are working so hard to keep the workers they have and to get new ones, combined with the digitisation of the workplace that is taking place.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the State should always be the first port of call for dealing with some of these costs.  If this is an arrangement that works for the company, employer and employee, then the employer and company have a role to play in looking at how some costs can be alleviated.  I know many different employers have done that over time.<\/p>  <p>  The point was made by Deputy Moynihan that many of the benefits, particularly outside of our cities, have been really positive; I can see that.  That is why going ahead with the national broadband plan was clearly the right thing to do.  As noted by Deputy Alan Farrell, I am aware of how some of this may change if people see some of the costs of working from home begin to change.  We will, of course, continue to monitor this to ensure we have an appropriate policy in place in that regard.  We made a change last year and I will continue to monitor how it is impacting on where work takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200019#R00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663843200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The Minister is quite right that the State cannot be the first port of call.  There is, however, a general supervisory role and level of communication with businesses, in particular, to try to effect a degree of co-ordination that works for their employees.  I spoke with one city centre business owner who has a core day on Wednesday.  Everybody comes into the office on a Wednesday for the purposes of physically seeing each other and developing relationships and so on.  That business also provides for three days per week in the office over the winter and two days per week over the summer in anticipation of summer holidays and sunny weather, etc., and just a better lifestyle.  That is the planning by that business to create three core days to facilitate its employees to come in and, as I said, avail of the shared heat and electricity.  It is that sort of signal from Government that we will maintain the balance in potential deductions.  As the Minister said, however, business has a strong role to look after its employees.  It is an important retention mechanism.

Accordingly, the Cabinet committee subgroup on insurance reform was established to prioritise this area for further action.  This reform work is being driven through the action plan for insurance reform, which sets out 66 actions, most of which have been completed.  According to the second action plan implementation report, published in March this year, the reform agenda is progressing well, with some 80% of actions completed at that time.  Further progress has been made in the meantime and some of the key achievements to date aimed at reducing costs include the following: first is the implementation of the personal injuries guidelines, and we are pleased that there have been judicial reviews on that which have been positive in standing over the judicial guidelines as originally set out; second, the Central Bank has put a ban on price walking for home and motor insurance, which will end the loyalty penalty imposed on some long-term customers.  That was enacted and completed by the Oireachtas recently; third is the establishment of the office to promote competition in the insurance market, which aims to lower costs by promoting greater competition in the Irish market.  That office is up and running and contains two elements.  It is about increasing the number of businesses that are operating in the State to extend their footprint into areas where they are not issuing insurance at the moment and it seeks to encourage new insurance companies to come into the market.  The main benefit of that is that it encourages consumers to come together and generate group schemes so they can go to some of the insurance companies with a significant portfolio of business, rather than each company going individually; and, fourth, is measures to reduce fraud, including the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, which has concluded and passed through the Oireachtas, and further legislation will be coming up in the immediate future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200020#S00700","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1663843800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I will make a quick comment and maybe the Minister of State will reply to me in writing to enable other colleagues to get their questions in.

Workers and families across the State are struggling and all the while the Government continues to brush aside meaningful proposals that would make a major difference and put money back into people&rsquo;s pockets.<\/p>  <p>  Nowhere is the cost-of-living crisis more obvious than in the rental market.  This is contributing to wider problems in the housing market.  Young people cannot afford to save for a deposit, house prices are out of control and there is not enough social and affordable housing being built.  An entire generation, because of the Government&rsquo;s policies, is locked into an unaffordable rental market and locked out of ever being able to afford their own home.  Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of working people in their late 40s and 50s are living in the private rental sector.  They are frightened that they have no way out of that rental market and face a future of pension poverty because of runaway rents.  This housing failure is robbing our people of their hopes and dreams for the future.<\/p>  <p>  I know the T&aacute;naiste believes that landlords should be prioritised and their incomes are more important than renters being able to live a decent life.  He said as much to the media in August.  He said it would be a good idea to introduce a tax cut for landlords, despite the fact that there is little evidence to suggest that such measures will address the causes of the crisis.  In fairness, however, he conceded that if he did so, he would do something for renters also.  Renters are the people who need to be prioritised.  Too often, we talk about rents in terms of percentage increases that we have seen year after year, but if we get down to the hard cash of it, the average new rent in this State is now just below &euro;1,500 per month, with rents in Dublin now over &euro;2,000.  Because of runaway rents, new renters will a fork out &euro;1,476 more this year to their landlord than they would have done last year.  Renters need relief.  As the T&aacute;naiste will know, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Government year after year to provide support for renters.  We have proposed for years a refundable tax credit that would put one month&rsquo;s rent back into renters&rsquo; pockets, reducing their rental costs and lifting some of the burden from them.  That would make a real difference to so many people.  Of course, any support like this must make a difference to the renters who are hard pressed and must not be pocketed by landlords through further rent hikes.

Renters can be supported and runaway rents can be tackled.  However, it is the Government&rsquo;s choice.  The budget is just days away.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste, on behalf of renters right across the State who are feeling so much pressure and have seen their rents go up year after year without support or action from this Government, if the Government will now, belatedly at this final hour, adopt Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s plan to support renters by putting one&rsquo;s month rent back into renters&rsquo; pockets and banning further rent increases - to reduce rents and to freeze them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200021#T00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1663844400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of the very high cost of rent in Ireland, which is out of kilter and disproportionate when compared with our peer countries.  I acknowledge that.  What the Deputy has said about what I have said in the past is not the case.  I have never said that landlords should be prioritised.  A little like the Deputy&rsquo;s leader, Deputy Doherty would not win any truth-telling contests.  I did not say that.  It is at best at misrepresentation and perhaps a fabrication, and I hope the Deputy will acknowledge that in his further response.<\/p><p>What I am interested in talking about is solutions.  There are a number of solutions to the housing crisis that we now face and a number of things that we can do to help renters.  Probably the most important and significant thing is increasing and ramping up the amount of social housing we have in Ireland.  As the Deputy will know, we are probably going to break records in terms of the number of new social houses provided in Ireland this year.  We are getting up to the kinds of figures we have not seen since the 1970s, if not before.  Social housing benefits everyone.  It takes people off the housing list and also frees up private accommodation for other people to rent and buy, thus exerting downward pressure on rents and property prices.  That is why we are investing so much in new social housing and why we will continue to do so in the years ahead.<\/p><p>The other area is cost-rental housing.  This programme was started by the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, under the previous Government but is now for real.  We see the huge demand for cost-rental housing and how interested people are in that form of public housing.  We need to see that scaled up as much as is humanly possible over the next couple of years.<\/p><p>We also have the help-to-buy scheme, a programme that has helped over 30,000 young people and young couples to buy their first home, often leaving rental accommodation and freeing it up for others.  This is something the Deputy&rsquo;s party opposes, wrongly in my view.  I hope in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s alternative budget it will consider dropping its opposition to the help-to-buy scheme.  It is the most important thing we can do for first-time buyers at the moment.  Saying to first-time buyers that we will not give them the &euro;30,000 back to help their deposit, but instead we will give them &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500 to help with their rent is not a good deal.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in would do.  It would take the &euro;30,000 away from first-time buyers and give them &euro;1,500 a year to help with their rent.  That is not a good deal and I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will drop its opposition to the help-to-buy scheme.<\/p><p>We also have the rent pressure zones which, as the Deputy will know, for tens of thousands of people, if not hundreds of thousands of people, have meant that rent increases have been 2% or lower.  That does not show up in areas like the <i>daft.ie <\/i>index for example, as the Deputy knows, but has been of great relief to many people who are renting in this city and country.  It has had negative consequences too.  It has probably had a negative impact on supply and has perhaps driven up rents when it comes to new tenancies.  That is something that we need to be concerned about.<\/p><p>In terms of budget measures and the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion of a credit for renters, that is a budget matter and it would not be appropriate for me today to comment on decisions that will be announced by the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, next week.

We are doing so at a time when we are facing unprecedented crises.  There is a crisis in the cost of living, and there are exorbitant price increases in food and fuel and in basic household necessities.  We are also facing an energy security crisis and a chronic housing crisis, where are seeing so many people being priced out of homes, either to rent or buy.  In the face of these crises, and while we are seeing healthy Exchequer figures at macro level, we in Labour are calling for Government to adopt a really serious and substantial cost-of-living package not only to invest massively in the building of new homes and in support for public services, but also to adopt a &euro;4 billion emergency package of measures to help alleviate the real hardship that so many families and households are facing into over this bleak winter ahead, which will undoubtedly be exacerbated by the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war there.<\/p>  <p>  There are measures that we in this country and this Government can take that are in our power to do, even in the face of massive international challenges.  We, in Labour, have called for three key measures to be adopted as part of an emergency package of measures to help struggling households and families.  Those three measures include, first, to cap childcare costs for families.  Every week I hear from constituents who cannot afford the sort of increases in fees for cr&egrave;ches that they are being charged, and from parents who simply cannot access cr&egrave;che places at all.  We are calling for a massive investment by Government in the national childcare scheme to ensure that childcare costs for parents will be no more than &euro;200 per child, bringing us into line with European average costs per month.  That is a measure that could be adopted in this budget and could really help alleviate hardship for parents who are struggling.  Second, we have called for the introduction of a &euro;9 monthly climate ticket to enable individuals to have unlimited public transport journeys across Ireland.  For the price of &euro;9, this climate ticket measure would not only help alleviate pressure on families faced with rising transport costs, but would also ensure that we are going some way to meeting our climate emissions targets in terms of reduction in the transport sector.  A similar measure was introduced in Germany.  We have called for that to be introduced, even for a six-month period, in this budget.  Finally, we are calling for the immediate extension of free GP care to all children and young people under the age of 18.  It has been a long-standing ambition of my party.  We saw the measure being introduced on an incremental basis previously.  However, this Government and the previous government have not done anything to further that ambition and to ensure that parents no longer have to think twice because of cost if they are faced with having a sick child to the doctor.  We want to see free GP care extended to all children under 18, and we want to see it done in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200022#U00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1663845000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I look forward to reading the Labour Party's alternative budget, hopefully being able to take on board some of the suggestions made.  We will have a budget next week.  The details will be announced by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform next Tuesday.  People will see a response of scale from the Government to help them with the cost-of-living crisis.  That will involve a multibillion euro package.  People will see that in their pockets and off their bills within weeks.  That will apply within weeks and will be deployed well before Christmas.  People will also see a multibillion euro package which will take effect in the new year.  It may not be possible to cushion everyone fully from the impact of the cost of living, but it will be our objective to do so for those on the lowest pay and the lowest incomes and for those on middle and higher incomes to help them out in substantial and meaningful way as well.  It is important that everyone gets help with the cost of living, but that those who need the help the most get the most help.  That will be our approach.<\/p>  <p>  I think that when it comes to any household budget, there are three elements: how much one is paid, how much one gets to take home after taxes and how far the money goes.  We need to help on all three fronts.  I know the Deputy's party is focusing on the third element, namely, the costs such as childcare, public transport and healthcare.  That is fair enough.  Those are the kind of areas that we want to help in as well.  On childcare, as all of the party leaders and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have said, it is our objective to reduce childcare fees next year.  However, we need to do it in a sensible way.  Notwithstanding the new agreement that we have to raise pay in the sector for childcare professionals and early educators, there are capacity constraints in the system.  As we know from previous experience in other areas, if the cost is reduced dramatically, demand rises and then we are left with a different problem around capacity.  We need to square that circle and get it right.  We must ensure that in reducing fees we do not solve one problem and make another one worse.<\/p>  <p>  On the &euro;9 public transport ticket, such a scheme was introduced in Germany.  However, what the Deputy did not mention was that it has been abandoned in Germany.  After consideration, the Government decided not to continue with it for a number of reasons, including affordability.  What we have done is to reduce public transport fares by 20% or 30%.  I think we have had a good result from that.  There are more people using public transport, but there are not problems with affordability or overcrowding.  We will give consideration to extending and maybe even improving on that in the context of the budget next week.<\/p>  <p>  On free GP care, the Deputy rightly pointed out that we made a good start on that.  Sometime ago, the former Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I brought in free GP care for children under six years.  We have managed to extend it to some other groups, for example, people with terminal conditions, children with cancer and people in receipt of the carer's allowance, since then.  However, to date we have not been successful in negotiations with the IMO and the doctors to extend it beyond six-year-olds.  Unfortunately, that is the reason why it has not proceeded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200022#U00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1663845000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I think everyone across the country will welcome the T&aacute;naiste's commitment that in the budget in just five days' time, we will see from Government a response of scale, and in the T&aacute;naiste's words, \"a multibillion euro package\".  However, what we need to see is also an ambition of scale and a real ambition to address these crises that are confronting so many households and a real ambition to take the necessary radical measures that will be required to sustain families, households and businesses through a bleak winter.  They are the sort of measures that we saw turned around swiftly by Government in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.  They are the sort of measures we are going to be calling for in our budget proposals this afternoon in order to build an Ireland that works for all.  Currently, there is a sense of a two-tier Ireland.  There is a sense that while some people are doing well, for many and increasing numbers of households there is simply this paradox of plenty, where Exchequer figures are positive but they are not feeling it in their own pockets.  What they are feeling is deeply pinched and squeezed by rising costs.  That is why we are focusing on social wage elements and the need to ensure that we are bringing down costs for families and households.  We are really hopeful that radical measures will be taken in this budget by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200022#U00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1663845000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

We need to respond to that reality by helping people with their bills.  We need to help put more money in their pockets and also help to reduce energy bills in particular.  As a country, we had a high cost of living long before this current inflation crisis.  There are areas in which the cost of living in Ireland is out of kilter not with Mediterranean countries or countries in eastern Europe which are very different to ours, but countries similar to ours in northern Europe, in childcare, healthcare, public transport and rents.

It is a country for profit-hungry energy companies, big corporations and property vultures - for the greedy and obscenely wealthy.  I think it is that sense that is going to lead thousands of people out onto the streets this Saturday to assemble at Parnell Square and march to this D&aacute;il before the budget to demand relief and protection from the cost-of-living and housing disaster that people are suffering.  The older people might be there because any pensioner, or for that matter any person on disability, who is solely dependent on State payments lives below what the Central Statistics Office, CSO, says is the minimum weekly disposable income necessary not to live in poverty.<\/p> <p>Let us think about that.

That is based on health, education and economic well-being.  One would think from the remarks of the Deputy that we were seeing a massive outflow of people from our country.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  The CSO, which the Deputy mentioned earlier, has indicated that the population of Ireland increased by 89,000 last year.  That is an extraordinary increase in population.  That includes tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the war, but that is not the half of it.  Many more are coming from the UK, the European Union and other parts of the world to work in this country.  Ireland is seen by them as a country in which there are great opportunities for employment and advancement.  Those same figures crucially show that more Irish citizens returned to Ireland last year than left.  That has been true for a number of years now.  The impression the Deputy would create is a different one.  People are entitled to their opinions but they are not entitled to their own facts.  This is a country that is ranked in the top ten in the world as a place to live.  Some 89,000 people have moved to this country this year.  More Irish people return to Ireland every year than leave.

The Teaching Council is the body with the statutory authority and responsibility for the regulation of the teaching profession in Ireland, including the registration of teachers in the State.  Upon registration with the Teaching Council, post-qualification professional practice is applied as a condition of registration for all primary and post-primary newly qualified teachers.  Until recent years, the traditional route to fulfil this condition for primary school was probation.  The Droichead process, which replaces the traditional process, consists of school-based induction, which is underpinned by reflective practices, mentoring, professional conversation and additional professional learning activities, such as observation, cluster meetings, the Taisce professional learning portfolio and the hours taught.  All of these activities address the needs of newly qualified teachers as they begin their careers.<\/p>  <p>  According to Droichead, a primary teacher will normally undertake the Droichead process when employed in a permanent, temporary or substitute capacity as a mainstream teacher.  A teacher is teaching all the hours of the primary school curriculum, including Irish, for the entire school day.  A teacher's tenure at the school may afford him or her the opportunity to meet minimum duration requirements.  Yet limitations are being placed on teachers as to what roles qualify for Droichead.  A newly qualified teacher may complete Droichead in one of the following roles: a special class teacher in a mainstream school; a teacher in a special school; a full resource teacher of people with low-incidence disabilities; or a full-time learning support teacher.  The restrictions involve teaching the same cohort of pupils.  The teachers need to complete a block of 60 consecutive days in eligible settings.  At a time when we are crying out for teachers, these requirements are excessive.<\/p>  <p>  I recently met members of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, who highlighted the issue of teacher-pupil ratios, which have a significant impact on children's development and learning.  Why are we making newly qualified teachers jump through hoops to do further training, inspections and supervision when they have already carried out placements and supervision during their qualifications?  Any primary level teacher who gets any teaching time should be able to count it towards his or her qualifications as part of the Droichead framework.  That is a big issue for some people.  These restrictive requirements are putting extra pressure on newly qualified teachers to find a job that qualifies for Droichead.  They prevent those teachers taking full-time roles, such as supply teacher roles, as they do not qualify under the rigid classroom and qualification requirements.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the Teaching Council confirmed that newly qualified teachers who secured posts on supply panels for the 2021-22 academic year may complete Droichead, the induction framework for newly qualified teachers.  However, that is not the case post-pandemic.  As I said, any primary level teacher who gets any teaching time at all should be able to count it towards his or her qualifications as part of the Droichead framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200023#V01100","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1663846200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for raising this important issue, which is a matter of great interest to newly qualified teachers, in addition to school management and school communities.

It would make sense to increase the block grant to take account of the fact that a public sector pay deal has just been done, which section 39 organisations will effectively have to pay.

Of course, some of the established media do not like the idea that one can circumvent their mediation of the news and you can put the news up yourself.

It reminds me of 130 years ago the plethora of pamphlets that were issued by people who could not get into the mainstream media in this country, such as James Connolly, who were putting forward a message that was maybe not the establishment message at the time and was not likely to have been published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, <i>The Freeman's Journal<\/i>or the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200028#DD00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1663848600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>It has not changed much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200028#DD00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1663848600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Agreed.

There is one element of this that I would like to talk about.  I understand in the Seanad there was an amendment put forward, that was not accepted but that the Minister was sympathetic to, that would make sure that public funding was made available to the commercial radio stations that provide content in the public interest.  I do not believe that, for example, RT&Eacute; has a monopoly of public interest.  For example, if one has got current affairs on RT&Eacute; and one has local current affairs at the same time on a local radio station that is focusing on the issues, national and local, of that area, why is one heavily subsidised and other not subsidised at all?<\/p> <p>Local radio plays a huge part in our society and a very positive role, and there are four elements to it.  One is that the stations get paid because they can go to the sound and vision fund.  That is for documentaries, etc., but no current affairs or news.  Even death notices, which are very important, certainly in rural areas, are not covered.  The second element that is not covered is current affairs and the third is local sport.  To me, that is all public service broadcasting, as much so as RT&Eacute; showing some World Cup soccer game.  I have nothing against it doing those things.  I believe, therefore, that it is time, not because they are commercial operators but because they are local and provide basic, fundamental services and there is nobody else to do so, that funding was provided to them.<\/p> <p> It is time, too, go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; cinnte de go bhfuil cothrom na F&eacute;inne &aacute; thabhairt don mhionlach sin sa phobal a labhra&iacute;onn an Ghaeilge gach uile l&aacute; agus a &eacute;isteann go rialta le Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus TG4.

None of us has not encountered to some degree the phenomenon of online bullying, which is consistent and constant.  Never could anyone make an argument - at least, a legitimate one - against an online safety commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that, to a degree, there is an element here of legislation trying to catch up with where technology is.  We are talking about some of the super-companies if we are talking about the likes of Facebook, although it did not work out too well for Mark Zuckerberg when he renamed that entire entity Meta.  It impacted how much he is worth but he will be all right and more able than others to withstand the difficulties people will be going through as regards the cost-of-living crisis we are in.

The fact is that, with Google and its search engine, we can get some information as to how it works.  We know how the page rank algorithm works and we know about the results.  In fairness, Google will provide information if it is sought, but probably the only way we can tell how the Facebook algorithm works - and it is the same for other social media platforms - is on the basis of how it works for the individual user, that is, with determinations made from multiple sources of information.  That is accepting that that is all information we have provided to Facebook.  We have to be very careful because we have seen where this has been weaponised in some cases by state actors and non-state actors.  We know about the issues that may have arisen in Myanmar.  We know that rogue states spend huge effort on online presence.  We really need to make sure we get a handle on this, while also dealing with the regular issues that are often voiced in here as to how the Facebook algorithm, for example, provided financial benefits in respect of certain content which was not particularly good for people's mental health.

I support what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about local radio.  There is a lot of information that local radio gives out that is not covered as local news but should be, and those stations should be supported in that regard.  Highland Radio and Ocean FM probably have a 90% listenership in Donegal.  RT&Eacute; is low down the priority list there.  That is important.<\/p>  <p>  Although I understand and agree with the intentions of this Bill, I am wary of the potential threats to privacy and freedom of expression.  It seems that this legislation, in its current form, would operate contrary to the EU Digital Services Act, which supersedes it.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that we urgently need to address the significant rise in online hate speech and online abuse in recent years.  It is getting to the point where we are seeing online abuse so often on our timelines that we are becoming almost immune to it.  However, we must never become immune to it and we must never accept this type of behaviour.  The online world is becoming an increasingly toxic and unhealthy environment for our young people as well as ourselves.  Steps need to be taken to ensure that people are given the same level of care and respect online that they are entitled to offline.  Online perpetrators should be held to account in the same way all perpetrators in this country should be.  We know that online abuse can have the same damaging effects that in-person abuse has.  Given that the effect is the same, I do not see why the consequences of engaging in such behaviour should be any different.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the fact that we all know that online abuse has a detrimental impact on people's mental health and well-being, as Amnesty International outlines, the psychological consequences of this abuse are under-researched and, as a result, understated.  We have no idea of the full scale of the effect that online abuse can have on people, but we can be sure that it is severe for all those who experience it.  Like most issues, these effects are felt most severely by women and minorities.  Unfortunately, these are the groups that tend to be targeted online.  As a white man, I am in a group that does not experience a lot of this abuse, and I have to recognise that.  Online abuse is serious for people who experience it, and we have to be aware of that.  Amnesty's research into this area showed that the majority of women polled across eight countries who experienced abuse or harassment on social media reported stress, anxiety, panic attacks, powerlessness and loss of confidence.  The National Women's Council of Ireland, in its report last year, found that women are making the decision to drop out of politics because of gendered social media abuse.  A report by the UN special rapporteur on minority issues shows that three quarters or more of the victims of online hate speech are members of minority groups and that women belonging to these groups were disproportionately targeted.  Unfortunately, this type of behaviour is only increasing.  The same report states that the fight against the tsunami of hate and xenophobia in social media appear to be largely failing because hate is increasing, not diminishing.  During the pandemic, there has been an incredible 20% rise in hate speech in the UK and the US.<\/p>  <p>  Shockingly, there is a vast and rapidly growing volume of child abuse material being created and shared online.  Reports show that the UK's child abuse image database has 17 million unique images on it and it is growing by 500,000 images every two months, which is appalling.  It is a problem that is only getting worse as time goes by and as the Internet expands.  The longer we stall in addressing this, the harder it will be for us to control it.<\/p>  <p>  It is with that in mind and with the clear understanding of the urgent need for such legislation that I am disappointed to say that I do not fully support this Bill.  All of us in this Chamber want legislation that addresses all the issues I have just highlighted, and I would be the first to put my full support behind legislation that addressed those issues effectively.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, this Bill just does not go far enough to protect our privacy rights.  It is also about getting that balance right between the privacy rights.<\/p> <p> There is far too much contained in the Bill.  Many wide-ranging issues are being addressed, which not only makes it very difficult to scrutinise, but frankly makes it vague and unspecific.  It is clear that the reason everything has been piled into one Bill is the European Commission decision to refer Ireland to the ECJ for failure to meet the transposition deadline for the revised AVMSD, and the significant financial penalties we are facing due to this.  It is completely unacceptable that so much of the legislation introduced in the State is in response to an emergency situation.  It reflects very badly on this House but also reflects poorly on the Government.  How many times in the past six months have we seen legislation rushed through the House because we were at risk of being prosecuted by the EU as we had not transposed directives into legislation.  There is plenty of time to transpose legislation if it is done properly and dealt with properly.<\/p> <p> That leads to the wider issue of how the House has dealt with legislation.  In a report given to the Business Committee yesterday it could be seen that July and December are the peak times for legislation to come through the House.  I am mindful that legislation is rammed through in those times and, therefore, there is no scrutiny.  That is the only reason there can be.  There is the excuse of deadlines that are set by the Department.  Some of that may be true but I do not believe it is.  I believe that the legislation goes through at that time so that there is little or no scrutiny.  Between January and June, there was less legislation put through the D&aacute;il than there was in the month of July, which is shocking.  It will be the same in the run-up to Christmas.  We will be scraping around looking for legislation and there will be statements here there and everywhere and there will be no legislation but in December, there will be a mad rush again to railroad stuff through.  This is why we get into situations like now where we have to rush this through to deal with the ECJ decision and the failure to transpose, when we could have been doing this in a timely fashion.  This is not the way or the environment in which legislation should be drafted, scrutinised or implemented.  It makes a mockery of our legislative process and results in messy, incomplete and rushed legislation.<\/p> <p> I understand the legislation proposes to dissolve the BAI and in its place establish a media commission with a wider remit, covering on-demand audiovisual media, visual sharing platforms and online safety.  The Bill also provides for additional powers for the media commission in respect of compliance and enforcement, including the power to impose administrative financial sanctions.  I understand that the Bill&rsquo;s intention is to introduce extensive provisions around online safety, by creating coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, and to set out a definition of \"harmful online content\".  One of the issues I have, however, is that the definition is far too vague.  The Bill is unspecific about the specific content that could lead to sanction.<\/p> <p> Once enacted, the commission will be able to issue a notice to remove, disable or limit access to specific content or apply to the High Court to block access to a service.  This could lead to a restriction of speech online that is legal offline, or indeed online when communicated privately, and this causes serious rights concerns.<\/p> <p> In their submission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, state that despite the Bill&rsquo;s intention to reduce harm \"this subjective opinion-based approach about feelings that could be had, in regards to already vaguely defined &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; content, could lead to a serious chilling effect on the rights to freedom of speech, opinion, and to the right to send and receive information&rdquo;.  Not only is this potentially unconstitutional, but there is also a potential threat to democratic debate.  The vagueness in language could lead to larger companies adopting more strenuous filtering measures or greater use of automated decision-making and algorithms in respect of removing online content.  The ICCL fears that this risks even greater speech restrictions in a world where machines may unjustifiably remove material due to the non-detection of art, parody, satire, irony or sarcasm, all which are critical for healthy democratic debate.  Overuse of restrictive filters can restrict genuine reporting, which could be a devastating unintended consequence of the legislation.<\/p> <p> I would be grateful if the Minister could address the submission put forward by Digital Rights Ireland on the inclusion of private communication services and cloud storage services in the legislation, which states that an online safety code will apply to an &ldquo;interpersonal communications service&rdquo; or a &ldquo;private online storage service&rdquo; in respect of offence-specific categories of online content.  This is a significant area of concern as the inclusion of private communication services is incompatible with the right to privacy and data protection.  As far as I know there is no justification given for why censorship of these services would ever be necessary or appropriate and Digital Rights Ireland has outlined that these provisions would not be compatible with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights or the ECJ.  The Bill does not make clear the obligations that will be placed on providers, nor does it make clear the specific services this will include, what this code will entail and how this measure will impact encrypted services.<\/p> <p> The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights warns that the regulation of encryption undermines human rights and strongly recommends that States would promote and protect strong encryption and avoid all direct, or indirect, general and indiscriminate restrictions on the use of encryption.  In her opening statement, the Minister mentioned that she may consider amendments on Committee Stage and I would strongly welcome this, especially around online safety codes for these services.<\/p> <p> Although I disagree with the legislation in its current form, I recognise that it is much stronger than when first published at the beginning of this year.  I understand that this is due to the Minister&rsquo;s genuine and productive engagement with the legislative process in the Seanad.  This engagement led to 62 amendments being tabled on Report Stage.  I particularly welcome the inclusion of a youth advisory committee and I also welcome that harmful online and media advertising targeted at children is now included within the scope of this Bill.  I am aware that the Civil Engagement Group Senators, in particular, pushed for this.<\/p> <p> I am disappointed that the issue of profiling children was not considered further by the Minister.  There are major gaps in the legislation in this area and I would appreciate more engagement from her on this as the legislation passes through the next Stages.  Areas that need particular attention are the advertising in online spaces for conversion therapy and the advertising of weapons to children.  A BBC article in June showed that knife crime among teenagers in the UK is being driven by online targeting.  The article showed how violent videos and knives for sale could be recommended on the social media accounts of teenagers and how a young boy named Olly was sadly murdered after being exposed to a violent world through his phone.  This is incredibly disturbing and it is very concerning to think that we are not protecting our young people from such dangerous targeted advertising.  I hope the Minister will look into this concerning issue and address this in the legislation.<\/p> <p> I also hope other Ministers will follow suit in recognising the importance of Opposition input.  As legislators, it is our job to make legislation as strong and as robust as we can, and this is only possible if proper engagement with the Opposition takes place.  Ministers often see Opposition input as an attack rather than an opportunity to gain a different view or even consider issues that may have been overlooked.  Although I do not support this Bill in its current form, I support its intent and welcome the engagement it has encouraged.  I hope that all future legislation is given the same consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200029#EE00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663849500,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being present.  It is important to note the impact this legislation will have on the future of media and how we interpret all methods of communication.  There has been extraordinary change in the past three decades in how people communicate on a daily basis.  I am probably part of the first generation of elected representatives, from the 2019 local elections to the general election in 2020, who have grown up as children, teenagers and young adults with social media platforms.  I have seen at first-hand the damage this can do.  As a consequence of social media there are many positives in people's lives by making it easy to communicate.  It has shortened the distance of communication for people who may be living abroad or have family abroad.  Social media can have significant positive ramifications.  From an economic point of view it is important to us in Ireland given the scale of investment by social media operators in the State.<\/p>  <p>  It must be said, however, that there are many areas that are hugely concerning, and that have long been concerns at EU level and domestically, in respect of the negative impacts that social media can have.  It is having a detrimental impact on people's mental health and their interpretation of the quality of life they enjoy even in the respective countries in the EU, and it is also an issue when it comes to trying to tackle crime and violence.  This is why we need to pursue this work.  I welcome the establishment of the media commission and the work that the Minister has been doing on that.  I commend her on her proactive approach on these issues, and I thank her for the work she has done.<\/p> <p>However, it is important that we acknowledge the serious urgency around this particular work.  I have significant concerns around prosecution that will come as a consequence of new legislation that we will bring forward.  Section 12 of this deals with that.  It is important that there is very strong back up when it comes to being able to prosecute people for illegal behaviour online.  One thing that requires serious consideration in this legislation is how we deal with anonymous online activity.  We have seen on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, very significant interference particularly in political dialogue by anonymous accounts.  It is extremely important that we work with major social media operators to try to cut down on the level of interference that is happening.  I am really concerned about the direction of travel when it comes to elections in our country and the external actors that we know for a fact are trying to influence democratic elections.  That is not just necessarily in respect of Ireland but at international level.  We cannot consider that we are not ourselves potential targets, particularly with upcoming elections.  We have local elections coming in 2024.  We know they will take place in May 2024 and there is potentially a general election between now and 2025.  It is exceptionally important that the Government moves really rapidly in this particular are to ensure those standards are in place with the work the media commission does to monitor online interference in the election process and the activity of anonymous online accounts.  These have been huge issues in the US presidential elections, for example, but also in European elections.  I refer to what has come out about Cambridge Analytica and what happened with the Brexit referendum.  It gives an indication of the significant impact that online activity can have when it is used for unethical purposes.  We must also do more work around sitting down with the companies.  There is an issue in Ireland because we rely on them so much.  The elephant in the room is the level of corporation tax that we receive from multinational companies working in social media.  It has a huge impact on people's quality of life in Ireland which is positive but I do not think it is wise for us to shy away from having those difficult conversations, which might have been an issue in recent years, around content moderation to protect vulnerable people and vulnerable users of online communications whether children or young adults as well as political discourse.  There is a very fine line.  Deputy Pringle spoke very eloquently about restrictions on freedom of speech.  They are important but we need a level of understanding and a common denominator with the changes that have happened.  If you go back 20 or 30 years, there were standards in place.  If something was printed in the press, it had to go through an editorial process.  Now, as the former Chancellor, Angela Merkel pointed out at European Council meetings, everyone is effectively an editor.  That presents very significant challenges around policing that; not necessarily restricting freedom of speech but the responsibilities on each individual are enormous because you have a worldwide audience for everything you say.  We have not quite come to terms with that yet.  That is why it is important this legislation is being brought before the House along with the establishment of the media commission.  The work it will do will be really positive and I am very supportive of it.<\/p> <p> We are not the worst example internationally of illegal online activity.  However, there is a lot of room for improvement for vulnerable users too.  Tackling things such as online child pornography and the purchasing of drugs online, which is a major problem with some platforms, is something the Government needs to look at.  There is also the negative impact it is having on antisocial behaviour.  Very sadly, in recent months we have seen some extraordinarily disturbing scenes of antisocial behaviour here in Dublin.  Thought needs to be given to the impact social media has in driving it on or making people feel that it is in someway acceptable.  That is something that needs to be asked.<\/p> <p> Education is key.  It is really important that the primary curriculum teaches the dangers of online activity.  I came through primary education in the 2000s when platforms like Facebook were only starting to grow and get established.  We now have a generation of people who are being born into this as their way of life.  It is important that we look at primary level and do further education around online activity that could put people at risk.  It must be age-appropriate, that goes without saying, but we need to look at the younger age groups in society to teach what is acceptable and unacceptable.  The number of devices connected to the web can range from a smart phone or watch to every games console which is connected to the Internet with web searching functions.  The age of exposure that children in this country get to the online world has dropped dramatically over the last decade.  That is something that the media commission should look into when it comes to the impact it is happening on younger members of society.<\/p> <p> I do not want to go on too much about it but I am concerned that we are ill-prepared here for political interference in online activity in our elections.  We must work with the Standards in Public Office and the media commission.  I am confident that the Government will take my contribution on board.  It is a major concern.  We all see what is going on with foreign actors trying to influence elections on the European Continent.  Ireland is no different.  We have a seat at the table at European level.  It is important that we work to protect the integrity of our electoral systems and online communications in this country.  It should form a key part, along with prosecution powers, in the legislation that is being considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200030#FF00200","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663850100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House and for the amount of work she has done in the Seanad on it.  It is really important and timely legislation and I commend her for her work.  It is legislation that has been needed for some time.  It is clear from our own regulation of politics and conversations with parents, schools and other actors, there is a need for regulation of social media.  I respect all of the points that have been made about freedom of expression and the right to it.  Freedom of expression is not and never has been an absolute right in this jurisdiction or any other.  The points raised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and others concerning censorship and freedom of expression are noted but I do not hear those same organisations standing up against infringements on people's privacy, the democratic process or on democratically elected people who have suffered at the hands of unfettered freedom of expression either.  It would be nice to see a little bit more balance in that dialogue that respects some of the players on the pitch who are actually trying to engage in the democratic process, protect freedom of expression more broadly and protect the democratic process itself just by their turning up and participating.  I raise that because I am on the Committee on Gender Equality which is there to consider the recommendations of the 100 citizens who did huge work in the Citizens Assembly.  A big piece of that work is about women in politics and women in public life more generally.  Professor Yvonne Galligan, among many other notable experts, came before the committee last week.  She noted in particular the insidious impact of social media on democracy and on democratic processes and particularly unregulated social media and the particular affect of that on women and minorities as Deputy Pringle and others have pointed out.  We are concerned with generally enhancing and increasing women's participation in politics and public life as a measure of the success of our representative Chamber and how off-putting the social media abuse - which we have all in the House experienced, male and female - can be for anyone to come into politics.  But it is obvious that it has been targeted at women in a different way, and I do not know there are many of us who might dispute that, or perhaps the nature of it is slightly different in respect of women so that it represents yet another barrier to getting more women into politics.  That was a particular feature of our debate at the Committee on Gender Equality last week.  It is important to highlight it here.<\/p>  <p>  Look at the responsiveness of social media companies in practice to issues that are raised.  In my experience, without naming any of the companies, the response from at least two of the companies was just appallingly poor to issues that were raised.<\/p> <p>Whether it is complaints made through their own channels, complaints made more directly or complaints made through other actors of the State, the timeliness and quality of response are genuinely poor.<\/p> <p> About a year and a half ago, one of the social media companies came to us with an idea in respect of the take-down facilities.  Of course, if something that has important reputational effect is put up about a politician or any other person, the most important thing is to simply have it removed.  Damages are not necessarily a remedy.  It is not a real remedy; it is about protecting the individual in the moment.  The company's suggestion was that the individual could go to the High Court at whatever time of the day.  The individual would need to be able to pay the fees to access the lawyers, and do so at whatever time of the day because social media operates at every time of the day, to get an injunction or some other relief from the High Court.  The individual would then need to come back to that social media company and show it the High Court ruling.  Then the social media company would have a good old think about whether it would then take down the piece.  By then the damage is done.  It just shows how disconnected these companies are.  Either they do not understand - which I do not believe - or they do not care about the impact these things can have on individuals' reputations.<\/p> <p> That is why this balancing legislation the Minister has introduced is so important.  It is important because it provides a counterweight to those platforms for freedom of expression which have enormous positivity but must be regulated.  I hear these points about freedom of expression.  Freedom of expression is a balanced right and not an absolute right.  It has gone too far in respect of the damage that can be done to individuals and systems such as the democratic system as a consequence of the very small number of entities using it so negatively and wrongly.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for the work she had done on the independent complaints mechanism.  I know she gave great thought to that matter and had an expert group consider it.  It relates to the timeliness of being able to respond and for people to be able to respond.  My understanding is that the Minister will introduce it first in respect of children and minors, following the Australian model and then assess whether that could be rolled out further.  I think that is exactly the right approach to take.<\/p> <p> CyberSafeKids is a great organisation which works with children, parents and schools across the country to provide better online safety training and support to parents who find their children in difficulties.  That was one of the key recommendations from its report two weeks ago.  It interviewed 4,500 young people and their parents about their social media use, their Internet use and the difficulties they had faced.  Parents faced difficulties in trying to protect their children where issues of bullying came up on Snapchat or YouTube videos that were being shared and linked throughout WhatsApp groups or different platforms that the children were using.  Those were either directly related to a child or were being used to continue bullying activity through online platforms.<\/p> <p> The most important thing for those parents was not some remote remedy, damages or other solution down the line but the protection of their child that night, dealing with the child's distress and protecting the child's emotional well-being.  In other debates we speak about these concepts very frequently.  We talk about mental health, the protection of children, removing bullying and all these different things.  However, what mechanism is available to a parent at 7.30 on a Tuesday evening to stop whatever is exacerbating their child's distress?  The only thing is to get the material down quickly, enabling the child to get on with things rather than having it escalating as these things do.<\/p> <p> The independent complaints mechanism requires social media companies to respond quickly or else the matter will be taken up with the online safety commissioner.  It applies pressure on the companies, not on the parent or the State.  Introducing this mechanism will have a behavioural effect for social media companies.  They will need to devote some of their welcome but very considerable resources to dealing with matters quickly instead of getting the sort of nonsense responses that people, including even elected Members of this House, get in response to complaints of a very serious nature.<\/p> <p> I do not care whether I get a response.  I am big and ugly and get on with things.  However, in respect of that child on a Tuesday night at 7.30, the parent needs a response for the child.  The step the Minister has taken with the independent complaints mechanism offers that.  The social media companies should be on notice that they will be expected to behave differently in respect of complaints that are raised, particularly with children who are so vulnerable.<\/p> <p> Other Deputies have spoken about the algorithms and how they are driven.  It is so easy for any person to test.  There is no question but that they are driven by negativity.  I hope this new legislation, through the creation of the commission, will provide a better opportunity to understand, challenge and question that in a real way and provide a better balance to what is available on the Internet and in media content generally.<\/p> <p> I congratulate the Minister and thank her for this piece of work.  I wish her well with the rest of the Bill's passage through the Houses.  In particular I thank her for the independent complaints mechanism which will make a genuinely practical difference and is something that parents can reach to on a Tuesday at 7.30 to protect their children.  Without it I do not know what they would have done in trying to manage social media bullying of their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200031#GG00200","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663850700,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill, which is not before its time, considering we have already been fined by the EU for our failure to implement the audiovisual media services directive.  The media commission is a much-needed expansion of the role of broadcasting authority.  Ireland is playing catch-up with how media have evolved.  The Law Reform Commission first mentioned the establishment of something resembling an online safety commissioner back in 2016.  In 2017, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire moved the Digital Safety Commission Bill to address the issue of the lack of regulation relating to online abuse.  The conversation has progressed since then, but the big issues then are still the big issues now.  I hope this Bill will provide us with a proper framework for protecting children from the worst traits of the Internet.  I hope this is the beginning of the end for social media companies' self-regulation.  They have shown themselves to be incapable of policing harmful content.<\/p>  <p>  No one thinks this will be a silver bullet that solves all child protection concerns that come with children having access to the Internet but it is a step in the right direction.  The Minister needs to ensure that enforcement in the area is strong and the Bill does not leave any wriggle room for companies looking to shirk their responsibilities.  I also hope the Bill will lead to more transparency about how social media platforms operate, allowing us to develop stronger policies in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism, which was published late on Tuesday evening, recommended that the individual complaints mechanism be phased in by 2024.  This will allow those being bullied or harassed online to make a complaint directly to the regulator, something Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports.<\/p>  <p>  I question why the report was published so late given that the Minister has had it since May and we have not had time to analyse it properly ahead of this debate.  That is not good enough, to be honest, but I hope its contents can be reflected in amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak briefly about another proposal in the Bill, namely, the content levy.  I would like to see the money collected from this measure allocated to independent Irish production companies and more specifically to Irish language media.  It would be a great way to ensure that money would be invested in Irish programming and would showcase the talents of our best and brightest in the arts sector.<\/p>  <p>  I highlight the need for staff employed by social media companies to review harmful content to be given support.  The Minister should impose some sort of duty of care on these companies to ensure they adequately support their workers.

In recent years, the self-regulation of online media has not worked.<\/p> <p>Social media operators have always tried to present their obligations as being subject to levels of oversight and standards different from those that apply to traditional media.  This has led to regulation that is difficult to enforce and allowed them to shirk responsibility.  That is the reason it is past time that this Bill came before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If it is to be effective, we need an individual complaints mechanism that does not submit to the pressures exerted by the social media giants off this world.  While I am pleased the Bill provides for a complaints mechanism, I would appreciate it if the Minister would outline her intentions when it comes to an individual complaints mechanism, as called for by the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, and others.<\/p> <p> On a positive note, I am pleased to see the Bill makes provision for additional categories of offences to be added in the future.  I hope this will enable the legislation to keep pace with innovations in the online world.  It is past time that regulations changed in step with advances online.  Tightened and more encompassing regulations only work if there is somebody is in place to regulate online content.  We must ensure the regulations that are set down can be overseen adequately, which means providing proper staffing, resources and support.  I refer to support because the well-being of staff whose job may be to review harmful content must be paramount.  We must ensure their mental health and well-being are safeguarded.<\/p> <p> Compellability is another issue.  We must ensure the provisions in this regard are robust enough and the old ways of Internet companies are brought to an end.  They must be held accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the inclusion in the Bill of exemptions provided to community radio and television stations from paying an industry levy, as well as the creation of a bursary scheme for journalists in community and local radio stations.  These media outlets must be shown the importance of the service they provide to their communities.  Often running on shoestring budgets, these stations acted as a pivotal point for communities during the pandemic.  Their efforts reduced isolation among those who found themselves alone at home.  They also chronicle local life, local ways and the nature of a locality.  They preserve a community's history and promote its identity.  They are invaluable and should be shown the appreciation they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200032#HH00300","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663851300,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Bille an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo agus is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceart n&oacute; chomh ceart agus is f&eacute;idir leis a bheith, ach go h&aacute;irithe an chuid sin a dh&eacute;anann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na r&aacute;itis agus na focail a deirtear n&oacute; fi&uacute; na f&iacute;se&aacute;in a bh&iacute;onn ar na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.

It will take vital steps to define categories of harmful and age-inappropriate online content.  It will empower the media commission to create binding online safety codes and provide a mechanism for complaints of harmful online conduct.  These are all important steps in the correct direction and the Bill is Ireland's opportunity to change things in this space and to show our leadership on a global stage.<\/p>  <p>  We are, as we know, an EU location of choice when it comes to the headquarters of many social media platforms, and that so many of them are based here gives us a great opportunity to become true leaders in this area.  Democracy is fragile and there need to be laws to protect it and citizens throughout the globe, whether they are in Ireland or Myanmar or on Capitol Hill.  Unfortunately, however, as we have seen, social media companies can be weaponised and can threaten and destabilise democracy.  Engagement-based ranking is dangerous - that is what Mark Zuckerberg told us - yet we are living in a metaverse where what we see on our social media platforms are the posts that will get corporations the most engagement and the most money.  Mark Zuckerberg was correct; it is proving dangerous to our values, our health, in particular the mental health of our young people, and our democracy.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, we used to look across the Atlantic at politics in the United States and thank our lucky stars that our politics was not fuelled by money in the way it is there.  Unbeknown to us, however, platforms were changing that under the radar.  The sad reality is that right now, someone can use money rather than message to influence the national discourse and shape democratic decisions.  That is not the kind of society or democracy I want to live in.  Social media poses amazing opportunities, especially for keeping families and friends connected, and it would probably pose nothing but opportunities if it were not monetised and had not become a global multibillion euro industry, but it did.  That has meant that the threats are just getting bigger, such as the threat to democracy and stability through how easily people can engage in the viral spreading of disinformation.  There are threats to our health, including our mental health and in particular that of young people, through the generation of patterns of online hate messaging.<\/p> <p>Earlier this year, the Facebook whistleblower, Ms Frances Haugen, appeared before the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media to give her input into this Bill.  It was fascinating to have her there given all the work she has done in this space.  Her bravery and insight have had ripple effects across the globe.  Her insight into how we can best protect young people online was not only fascinating but actually really practical.  I was particularly struck by something she said about safeguarding children of 12, 13 or 14 years of age and how modern technology like facial recognition could be adopted to make a digital age of consent work.  That is a really interesting point because we in Ireland constantly struggle with the idea of a digital age of consent and how to get it to work without needing or requiring someone to share private data as a child's proof of age.<\/p> <p> Ms Haugen also had a comment on individual complaint mechanisms.  She said they would have to be enacted in a way that does not lead to our new commission drowning in complaints, which is a really important point.  I welcome the efforts of the working group to provide exactly this.  I am pleased that the expert group recommended the introduction of an independent complaints mechanism for harmful online content on a phased basis that will prioritise children first.  That is so important.  It is our children and their mental health that most need the protection.<\/p> <p> However, we need to strike the right balance between allowing people the ability to escalate their complaints without flooding the system to the point where it no longer works.  That is where technology can be utilised for good.  It is not that difficult to write software that can provide people with a way of making complaints.  If it was done in that way, it could create a mechanism whereby a broad range of complaints could be channelled through our NGOs.  That would highlight where we have hundreds or even thousands of people who are all complaining about the same issue.  It would enable us to identify and address these issues which, as we can see, the social media companies will not do on their own.  Doing that in a manner where takedowns are also required immediately would be so important because they only work if they happen when they should.  We have amazing NGOs in our country such as Webwise, CyberSafeKids, SpunOut, Bodywhys; the list goes on.  They could be crucial here and they have already been crucial in shaping this Bill.<\/p> <p> One concern I have about the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill can be framed as more of a question.  Is it overly focused on content as opposed to the systems set up to optimise and target the content?  Perhaps we need to look more at the root of the problem and the algorithms used, and the fact that they need to revert to what they were before 2018 so that reactions and engagements are no longer the driving metrics of social media companies.  Investment needs to happen in artificial intelligence around local languages and moderating content so that we are minimising the human cost of censorship.  We need mandatory risk assessments that relevant NGOs, like those I mentioned, and other bodies can chime into in order to return accountability to the social media companies, thereby ensuring it is the polluter who pays.<\/p> <p> The EU Digital Services Act is a really impressive piece of legislation.  There is an awful lot to be learned from looking to Europe on this.  The EU Act will ban targeted advertising based on sensitive data like race, political opinions, religious beliefs, health and sexual orientation.  It will ban practices aimed at misleading users and using deception or techniques to influence users&rsquo; behaviour through what it calls \"dark patterns\".  It will provide for a crisis response mechanism to analyse the impact of the activities of very large online platforms and search engines on a specific crisis.  This is an addition to the Act in light of Russian aggression in Ukraine.  It will also allow us to seek compensation for any loss or damages resulting from platforms not complying with their obligations.<\/p> <p> Ireland is in a unique position.  We will benefit from this legislation as an EU member but we are also the European headquarters of so many of the companies about which we are talking.  We need to be a leader in online safety.  I congratulate the Minister for prioritising this legislation to make us so.  This Bill is an opportunity for Ireland to become a global leader in the digital age.  It is an opportunity for us to positively impact on children's health and well-being and to positively impact on the mental health of every social media user right across this country, whether he or she is from Lucan, Longford, Clondalkin or Cork.  I am really glad that the Minister is grasping that opportunity.  I thank her, the NGOs, her steering group and task force for all working so collaboratively on this Bill.  I hope to see it strengthened further.  I know it will have a real impact on people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200034#KK00700","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663852500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on making this progress.  I was Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment when we started this journey and it certainly took much innovation and thinking about what other countries had done and what would be most appropriate in Ireland.  I know the team put a lot of work into assessing the choices that have led to the Bill that has finally been presented here.  It is really important that we create obligations on these platform companies in the areas the Minister has singled out.  We need to create codes of conduct with independent oversight by the commissioner.  It is correct that the Minister has created the scope to evolve new arenas where codes may be needed.<\/p>  <p>  Looking back through history, the printing press was a revolution that transformed society in terms of education, freedom of expression, research, scientific endeavour and political debate.  The Internet and social media platforms are another such revolution.  They provide almost barrier-free access to information, the ability to express one's view and access to entertainment.  As other speakers have said, while the Internet has extraordinary potential and has transformed people's access and opportunity, it is also the avenue to fake news, manipulation and vulnerability for people who could become victims of what happens online.  It seems to me that it has taken us hundreds of years to evolve the sort of protections that are in place for print media in terms of defamation, responsibility for what is published, privacy, protection of the weak, protections against discrimination and so on.  That has been a continuing evolution over hundreds of years.  The reality is that much of this has to be reinvented in the digital space, but we do not have the luxury of waiting hundreds of years for that to evolve.  It is changing the way in which people live so dramatically and quickly that we need to collectively develop approaches.  This is a very important first step but in reality, it is only a first step.<\/p>  <p>  The gains to society from these opportunities are, of course, enormous.  They will give, and are giving, a new fillip to education, research, innovation and, indeed, democratic participation.  We are still a long way from seizing the opportunities in education that digital transformation offers us and we need to come to terms with that.  These side effects on our society are ones we need to think long and hard about.  As outlined in the Bill, the online world must be safe.  We are just starting on that journey.<\/p>  <p>  One of the features that makes it very different from traditional publishing is that the Internet and social media is a two-way system in which customers and consumers surrender the most intimate details of their lives to the providers.  The gathering and use of this information is an instrument of incredible power and penetration, with all the algorithms and unknown and possibly unknowable biases that are built into how people are targeted.  It can target people, however.  It can publish what it likes to a large extent.  It can create the impression of a bandwagon in artificial ways.  It can create the impression of equality between fact-based science and fiction.  As Deputy Higgins said, its aim is audience, not evidence.  This creates hazards.  We are not trying at this point in this Bill to regulate much of that, although no doubt the codes of conduct will start to touch on how this gathered information is to be deployed.  It is really important that we see the Online Safety Commissioner break new ground and become very much aware of what is happening in other countries.<\/p> <p>Open and pluralist democratic societies like ours need to respond.  Social media generally has not created a great commons in which democratic debate proceeds and we have the great ferment of ideas and exchange.  The tragedy is that it has created insider camps and capsules in which people do not hear any views other than those of like-minded people.  The more divisive the message, the more attractive some of those groups become to build audiences.  At its heart is not truth, justice and the dignity of the person, which ought to be at the heart of the democratic engagement we try to create.  We have a problem here.  We see that other states which take a different approach to their citizens have rigorously controlled these platforms.  Unlike us, they have extraordinary controls and use the two-way system I have described to track and trace what their populations are doing and to cut down on any activity that would be seen as inimical to the interests of the governing elite.  We are living in a world where some states approach social media in that way.  In the democratic world, we are at sea as to how we will manage this.  People who use social media live in a world in which they can vote every minute with their likes.  This gives people a certain satisfaction, but it is far from the deliberation that politics needs if we want to nurture and protect policy based on evidence and respect for individuals.  We need to see evolve, whether at European or national level, new institutions tasked with fact-checking and evidence-checking.  We must create authorities, not just codes of practice that try to catch the most damaging extremes of what is happening.  We also need some form of regulation that allows quicker fact-checking and access to institutions in which the public can have confidence.  Such structures must achieve a standing within communities whereby citizens value what they say rather than the free-for-all that is out there.<\/p> <p> We have all seen that the connection between us, as politically elected people, and our voters has become more difficult over time for all sorts of reasons, including changes in society, communication and the way people live.  We must find a substitute for that and find ways in which people can have a connection with those whom they elect.  It is a challenge to us and the parties we represent to think how that can be done.  In my party I have been involved in the creation of what we call a policy lab, which tries to reach out to a wider range of people and interest them in the shaping of policy.  It is one small way in which we can do that as a party.  We must think more broadly as a political community about how that can happen.  The Ceann Comhairle had a very useful session that I was fortunate to attend where that sort of outreach was happening on a non-partisan basis.<\/p> <p> It has been argued that there is a risk of overreach in terms of the restrictions we may be putting in this Bill on freedom of expression.  The comment has been made that we are seeking to make something illegal online that might be legal offline.  The power of online communication and the way it can be used within that system is so dramatically different that we are right to stray a bit beyond what we have been used to as standards within the print media.  To be fair to the Minister, the democratic control that she has put into the Bill - how new areas of harm would be identified for the evolutions of codes and so on - is pretty robust.  If we continue to be worried, perhaps we could elevate the online commissioner to something akin to an ombudsman with presidential appointment, or different ways of appointment, and direct reporting to the D&aacute;il to acknowledge the importance of that role.<\/p> <p> The codes to be developed by the online commissioner are very much to be welcomed.  The one point I worry about is that if these platforms do not have a duty of care within themselves, and we are waiting for the online commissioner to catch up with a code that regulates the use of algorithms or whatever it is, like most financial regulators, we will always be arriving breathless and late to the crisis point that we need to address.  There needs to be a duty of care and a precautionary approach built in as an obligation of these platforms.  The commissioner can vet whether they are adequate.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that the generation of local and cultural content is threatened by online platforms.  The advertising models they have depended on are hugely undermined.  This is something the Minister recognises.  I congratulate her on her efforts.  We must continue to strive in that regard.  The Bill will take some steps in that direction to create the opportunity for local, relevant and reliable cultural and sporting content to continue to be generated to create that commons within our communities that is so important and which is very much at risk from those I call political buccaneers, whom we have seen in many countries trying to undermine the values we hold so dearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200035#LL00200","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663853100,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Members of the House for their valuable contributions.  The level of engagement during pre-legislative scrutiny and legislative scrutiny here and in the Seanad has been most welcome and of considerable benefit in ensuring this Bill meets our needs, both today and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I apologise to the members of Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for the delay in sharing the report of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism.  This was an unfortunate and unintentional administrative oversight, especially as the committee was so involved in the work that led to my decision to establish the committee.<\/p>  <p>  Members have raised a range of important issues.  While I cannot address them all today, I will briefly respond to a number of points.  Deputies Munster and Mythen raised the issue of Oireachtas oversight of the activities of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  The Bill as it stands contains numerous provisions relating to Oireachtas oversight, including the direct accountability of the executive chairperson and the commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees.  However, as legislators we must be mindful that an coimisi&uacute;n will be an independent regulator, as required by EU law.  As such, it will be responsible for carrying out its day-to-day activities, subject to Oireachtas oversight.  For example, regulatory codes such as media codes, media rules and online safety codes will be subject to negative resolution procedures before these Houses.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Munster, Mythen, Kelly, Cannon, Kenny and Patricia Ryan raised the issue of appropriately resourcing coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, including with expert staff.  At present, the recruitment process for the roles of executive chairperson, online safety commissioner and media development commissioner is ongoing and is expected to conclude in November.  Work is continuing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to finalise the estimated medium- and long-term staffing and resourcing requirements of an coimisi&uacute;n.  A key part of this is identifying the necessary expertise required by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n in order to fulfil its functions.  In this regard, recruitment is expected to take place in tranches over a period of time following the appointment of the commissioners and the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n.  I agree that there are specific skill sets required and that this is a rapidly changing environment.  I am committed to supporting an coimisi&uacute;n in delivering on its goals in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Mythen, &Oacute; Cathasaigh, Gould and Patricia Ryan raised the regulation of gambling.  As Deputy Mythen noted, my colleague the Minister for Justice is in the process of bringing forward a Bill to establish a new gambling regulatory authority and, to that end, has recently recruited the CEO for that body.<\/p>  <p>On Report Stage in the Seanad, I tabled a Government amendment to ensure that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n would work with this new body to strengthen both the regulation of gambling and media and online safety.  I am confident that this approach will enable the two regulators to collaborate effectively in addressing their shared challenges.<br\/><br\/>While freedom of expression is a key value and virtue of this House, Deputies Munster, Kelly, Cannon, Tully and Barry specifically raised concerns in relation to protecting freedom of expression and striking an appropriate balance of rights within the Bill.  More specifically, a number of Members raised concerns in relation to section 46J(1)(a) which concerns duties on broadcasters and video on-demand services, including a duty not to broadcast or make available anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence.  I must state that this provision is carried over from the 2009 Act and is currently a part of Irish law.  However, during the Seanad debates on this Bill I committed to examining this issue further with a view to potentially tabling an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and that is what I am presently doing.  Therefore, I acknowledge the concerns that have been raised and I am examining them.<br\/><br\/>Deputies Munster, Tully, Kelly and Gannon raised the working conditions of content moderators working for online platforms.  While I agree that this is an important issue, it is a matter of employment law and is something that the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been examining.  I will ask my officials to liaise with their colleagues in that Department on this matter.<br\/><br\/>Deputies Munster, Kelly, Gannon, Kenny, Barry and James O&rsquo;Connor raised the issue of disinformation, which is a significant and complex issue and requires a distinct and targeted response.  At EU level it is being dealt with through the completed and strengthened code of practice on disinformation, which will be linked to the Digital Services Act.  The Act will set out standards for platforms in dealing with this issue. Coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will ultimately be the main regulator for the Digital Services Act in Ireland.  Therefore, this is how we plan to regulate operationally for disinformation in Ireland, bulwarked by the EU code of practice.  In addition to this, my Department is planning to establish a working group, comprising relevant Departments, agencies and key stakeholders, including the European Digital Media Observatory hub at Dublin City University, to progress the recommendation of the Future of Media Commission to create a national counter disinformation strategy in order to complement the work of the EU in tackling disinformation.<br\/><br\/>A number of Deputies raised matters relating to media sustainability.  In this regard, Deputies Canney and Michael Collins raised issues in relation to local radio, including access by local radio stations to the journalism bursary provided in the Bill.  I can confirm that I intend to propose an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure local radio stations have access to the bursary. <br\/><br\/>In relation to a potential content production levy and scheme, it is intended that this levy will be introduced by an coimisi&uacute;n subject to an assessment of its viability and of whether it would have any negative effects.  This is because there are risks as well as benefits for the Irish audiovisual sector in the introduction of a levy.  Some stakeholders have asked whether I would set out the exact percentages of and process of the levy in the legislation.  I think that such an approach would be inflexible and that an coimisi&uacute;n, as an independent body, should have the power to design and enforce the levy and to change it over time.  I expect that an examination of the content production levy will be among the priorities of an coimisi&uacute;n upon its establishment.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Higgins raised the question of algorithms.  Online safety codes made by the online safety commissioner can address the use of algorithms to deliver, recommend and moderate online content.  This is key to this systemic framework to regulate online platforms and to tackle the availability of harmful online content.  Deputy Pringle raised issue of private messaging services.  These services are covered by the Bill but only in respect of offence-specific online content of which there are 40 categories linked to existing criminal offences.  This means that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n can set out obligations for these services through online safety codes for how they address this type of content.  This includes standards for complaints handling, reporting requirements and technical mechanisms to reduce the availability of such content.<br\/><br\/>Deputy James O'Connor raised the educational role of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  The online safety commissioner will have a role in carrying out educational initiatives, such as public information campaigns, and will work with existing educational bodies such as the Department of Education through <i>webwise.ie<\/i>and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  An coimisi&uacute;n will also be empowered to work with local, community and sporting bodies on training and educational initiatives, including media literacy and online safety.  The commissioner will also be able to endorse third-party providers of online safety educational materials which will help schools to source appropriate and robust online safety materials.  There have been some suggestions that an coimisi&uacute;n should have a role in accrediting certain educational materials.  I would not consider it appropriate for this regulatory body to overstep into the field of professional accreditation, but I think a good balance is struck by allowing the endorsement of such materials and allowing the delivery of educational initiatives and the provision of support to educational bodies.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Members of the House for their engagement with this vital legislation.  While it is complex and expansive, it is necessary.  In this regard, a number of Members have raised concerns that the Bill is too large.  I take a different view.  The Bill is comprehensive and sets out regulatory frameworks for media and online safety which are responsive and adaptable to changing circumstances.  In our fast-paced, information-driven era, this is sorely needed.  I know that a number of Members intend to table amendments to the Bill as it passes through this House.  In this regard, my officials are available to meet with any Deputy who intends to introduce amendments in order to tease out any issues that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200036#MM00200","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663853700,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1663853700,"counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200037#NN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1663853700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>  <p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200037#NN00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Tailte \u00c9ireann Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1663853700,"counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200037#NN00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1663853700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200037#NN00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1663853700,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"  <\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I am happy to have the opportunity to outline before the D&aacute;il the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill 2022.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority, PRA, and Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, through the establishment of a new body, to be called Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann will be a body corporate with perpetual succession and an official seal.  It will be independent in the performance of its functions, and those functions will include all those currently undertaken by the Commissioner of Valuation, the Boundary Surveyor, OSI and the PRA.<\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Office is an independent Government office under the aegis of Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is staffed by civil servants and headed by the Commissioner of Valuation.  The core business of the organisation is to provide ratepayers and local authorities with accurate, up-to-date valuations of commercial and industrial properties.  These valuations are integral to the commercial rating system in Ireland, and form the basis for a very significant element of local government revenue each year.  It also provides a valuation service to Government Departments and offices, State agencies and other public bodies, and carries out open market capital and rental valuations including valuations for rent reviews for these customers.  It is the custodian of an archive of unique records which provide information and insights into the social history of Ireland, covering the period from the mid-1850s to early 1990s.  These records provide an invaluable resource for genealogical and historical research.<\/p>  <p>  OSI's main public service function is to create and maintain the definitive mapping records of the State.  The work of OSI is essential to the infrastructural development of Ireland.  There is a growing recognition among decision-makers that knowledge and understanding of location is a vital component in effective decision-making.  OSI has developed an industry-leading mapping framework.  It enables consistent referencing and integration of data from other sources to a specific location.  Knowing where things are and how they relate to each other allows for better analysis, drives efficiencies and encourages the optimum use of resources. <\/p>  <p>  The PRA is the State body with responsibility for the land registry and registry of deeds.  Its mission is to safeguard property rights and transactions in Ireland.  As custodians of the digital national land register, its function is to provide a system of registration of title to land which is accurate, reliable and readily accessible.  <\/p> <p>The main functions of the PRA are to manage and control the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds and to promote and extend the registration of ownership of land.  It also operates the ground rents purchase scheme under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  These three organisations will merge to form Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Tailte &Eacute;ireann will provide a comprehensive and secure property title registration system, an independent rateable valuation system and authoritative location information and geospatial infrastructure.  These are central to the effective management of the property, planning, agriculture, local government, environmental and construction sectors of the economy.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s central source of authoritative and definitive land and property information will support the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in developing a national land information model, underpinning an electronic marketplace for spatial planning, property transactions and services.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann will provide streamlined access to the delivery of enhanced land and geospatial services to Government and other stakeholders and citizens.  This will result in more co-ordinated strategic and business planning, evidence-based decision-making and innovative service delivery in line with Government policy.  As one organisation, Tailte &Eacute;ireann will facilitate integration of data internally across its core functions and externally in partnership with other State organisations.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann will represent an entity more capable of contributing to and influencing policy formulation that supports social and economic development.<br\/><br\/>I will now provide an overview of the Bill.  The Valuation Office, PRA and OSI together manage a comprehensive set of property and spatial data.  Combining all three in Tailte &Eacute;ireann will optimise the benefits of land information for the continuing economic and social development of Ireland; provide citizens, businesses and policymakers with ease of access to and use of location information, including property and title information, commercial and industrial property, valuation data, maps and aerial imagery; and lead, develop and maintain national spatial information infrastructures, and support better land administration.  <br\/><br\/>I will elaborate on the provisions of the Bill.  This is a relatively short Bill, comprising four Parts, 41 sections and two Schedules.  Part 1, covering sections 1 to 5, inclusive, addresses preliminary and general matters.  These include the Title, arrangements for bringing the Bill into operation and standard provisions.  Part 2, which takes in sections 6 to 26, inclusive, will provide for the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  This is the most substantive Part and sets out the functions and organisational structure of the organisation, the appointment of a chief executive, the board, staff, and preparation of a statement of strategy, annual reporting and other related matters<br\/><br\/>.  Sections 6 and 7 provide for the establishment day of Tailte &Eacute;ireann, that it shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and an official seal authenticated by the chief executive and the board to have power to acquire, hold and dispose of land, and shall have power to sue, or be sued, in its corporate name.<br\/><br\/>Section 8<i><\/i>sets out the general functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann as detailed under this Act, including all functions undertaken by the Commissioner of Valuation, the Boundary Surveyor or a dissolved body and any such additional functions as conferred by the Minister.<br\/><br\/>Sections 9 and 10<i><\/i>set out the provisions for the functions of the Board of Tailte &Eacute;ireann, which will be strategic in nature.<br\/><br\/>Sections 11 to 19, inclusive, set out the provisions for the functions and appointment of a chief executive of Tailte &Eacute;ireann, and provide for the appointment by the chief executive of such number of persons to be the staff of Tailte &Eacute;ireann, subject to the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br\/><br\/>Section 20<i><\/i>provides that Tailte &Eacute;ireann may engage consultants or advisers to assist in the performance of its functions and pay their fees.  Section 20(2) provides that Tailte &Eacute;ireann shall comply with any directions concerning the appointment of consultants and advisers which may, from time to time, be given to it by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br\/><br\/>Section 21<i><\/i>provides for the disclosure of any beneficial interest by a board member, or a committee connected to the Board, to disclose that interest and its nature to the board for its consideration, and to determine the appropriate action to be taken in relation to the matter.<br\/><br\/>Section 22<i><\/i>provides for Tailte &Eacute;ireann to prepare its first strategy statement in accordance with section 4(1)(b) of the Public Service Management Act 1997.  Subparagraph (i) of that paragraph shall be construed as if it referred to a period of within six months after the establishment day of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Section 23<i><\/i>provides for the submission of an annual report, not later than 30 June in each year, to the Minister on the performance of the functions and principal activities of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Sections 23(5) and 23(6) provide for the submission of further reports that Tailte &Eacute;ireann or the Minister may consider appropriate in relation to any particular matter relating to the functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Section 24<i><\/i>provides that a member of the board or a committee of the board, an empowered person or any adviser or consultant or their staff shall not, unless under exceptional circumstances, disclose confidential information obtained by him or her while performing his or her functions.<br\/><br\/>Section 25<i><\/i>provides that the Minister, having consulted the chief executive and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may specify by order the fees payable to Tailte &Eacute;ireann in respect of the performance of its functions.<br\/><br\/>Section 26<i><\/i>provides that the expenses incurred by Tailte &Eacute;ireann in the performance of its functions shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 contains three Chapters and takes in sections 27 to 38, inclusive.  It provides for the dissolution of bodies and the transfer of functions, legislative references, land, property, rights, liabilities, staff, records, and other related matters to Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  Chapter 1, section 27 provides for the dissolution of the PRA and OSI on the establishment day of Tailte &Eacute;ireann<br\/><br\/>.  Sections 28 and 29 provide that all functions that were vested in the dissolved bodies, the Commissioner of Valuation and the Boundary Surveyor, are transferred to Tailte &Eacute;ireann on the establishment day, and direct that on and after the establishment day, references in any enactment other than this Act, or any instrument made under such an enactment to either a dissolved body, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor, will be construed as references to Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Section 30 sets out that on establishment day lands and other property that were vested in the dissolved bodies, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such lands shall, without any conveyance or assignment, shall stand vested in Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Sections 31 and 32 provide for the transfer to Tailte &Eacute;ireann of rights and liabilities, and continuation of leases, licences and permissions granted by a dissolved body, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor, and that all liability for loss occurring before establishment day, and any legal proceedings pending immediately before the establishment day by a dissolved body, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor, shall lie against Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Sections 33 and 34 provide various provisions consequent upon conferral of functions on or transfer of assets and liabilities to Tailte &Eacute;ireann, and that where an application made to a dissolved body, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor, before the establishment day, shall, where the application was not determined before the establishment day, be treated as an application made to Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 2, sections 35 and 36, provide for the transfer of staff and their terms and conditions of employment to Tailte &Eacute;ireann, and provides that the pension payments and other superannuation liabilities of a dissolved body, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor, shall, on establishment day of Tailte &Eacute;ireann, become the liabilities of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 3, sections 37 and 38, provide that each record, held by a dissolved body, the Commissioner of Valuation or the Boundary Surveyor shall, on and after establishment day, stand transferred to and be property of Tailte &Eacute;ireann and be regarded as being held by Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  The final accounts and final annual report of the dissolved bodies, Commissioner of Valuation, and Boundary Surveyor, shall be prepared by Tailte &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Part 4, sections 39 to 41, provide for consequential amendments to other enactments in relation to the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann and certain valuation-related matters.  Schedule 1<i><\/i>provides for the constitution and composition of a board structure for Tailte &Eacute;ireann and other matters, and Schedule 2 provides for references to the provisions of repealed enactments.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, this is largely technical legislation that is primarily designed to establish the merged Tailte &Eacute;ireann organisation in the most efficient way.  Accordingly, there are no significant new policy initiatives contained in this legislation.  Rather, in line with similar legislation, the general scheme is focused on the statutory provisions necessary to bring about the merger of the three existing organisations into the new organisation, the governance of Tailte &Eacute;ireann when it is established, and the carrying out of its functions into the future.<\/p> <p>I am thankful to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny that was afforded to the general scheme of the Bill.  I look forward to Deputies' contributions as we progress the Bill through the parliamentary process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200037#NN00700","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663854900,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  On paper, it provides for a sensible merger of three data-heavy organisations that regularly work together.  I understand there is some reduction in cost, which is welcome, but I caution that we need to ensure no reduction in staffing levels across all the organisations.  I am sure that many of the Deputies here have in recent months dealt with cases involving the PRA, in particular, which has large backlogs.  People are left waiting for months on end for answers to queries and requests.  I understand that staff are doing their best post Covid but there does not seem to be the required number of staff available to deal with the amount of work.  It is not an issue I encountered before the pandemic.  The Department indicated that the Bill would save money.  I ask the Minister of State to consider utilising those funds to properly resource the PRA.  People who are looking to purchase homes are struggling.  Many of them are paying expensive rents.  Delays such as this cost those people large sums that they simply cannot afford.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to further consider the role of Tailte &Eacute;ireann when identifying, managing and considering land banks, particularly public land banks.  Given the organisation will oversee valuations, mapping and registration, I am concerned that a failure to include land banks management, or at the very least the management of the data on land banks, as a responsibility of the new group is an oversight.  I ask him to clarify the reasoning behind this.  We need to know exactly how much public land we have and where it is.  When local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, are looking to build housing, a database they can use to see where land is and who owns it would be a significant asset.  When Deputies and councillors are reviewing local authority plans, such a resource would be of great benefit.  I acknowledge it exists in some form but it is not accurate and will not come under the remit of this organisation.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of dereliction and vacancy.  The Minister of State is well aware that I have a particular interest in vacant properties and derelict properties and sites.  The Derelict Act 1990 and the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 set out clear guidelines for the completion of a local authority registry of derelict and vacant sites.  It is assumed that something similar will be introduced with the zoned land tax and, hopefully, with the vacant homes levy.  These registries are great sources of information.  Unfortunately, they often do not reflect the reality on the ground regarding the number of sites and the value of the sites on the register.  There are currently only 95 sites on Cork city's derelict sites register and only 13 on the vacant sites register.  That is not a true reflection of the dereliction and vacancy in Cork.  It is a problem we are facing throughout the State.  Given the roles of the three organisations involved, some support could be given to local authorities to ensure accurate registration and to assist them to keep the registers up to date.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of the day, we need everyone working to solve dereliction and vacancy.  While the Minister might have no intention of incorporating the valuation office into Tailte &Eacute;ireann, given the data-heavy nature of the three organisations, they may have a role to play in ensuring the registers are kept up to date.  We are all sick to the back teeth of hearing there are no solutions to dereliction.  I believe there are.  The dogs on the street know that.  The reality is that we need to do more.  Through the Bill, we can help to keep registries up to date, local authorities can collect levies, and the Government can provide funding and compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for local authorities.  In those ways, we could make a difference.  After more than two years in government, the Minister still refuses to walk around Cork so I can show him the dereliction and vacancy that run throughout the city and county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200039#PP00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1663854900,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  This is probably the least controversial Bill he will bring before the House in his time in office.  Given the unseemly row we had the last time he was bringing forward legislation, it is probably better for both of us this close to the weekend.  However, the fact it is not a controversial Bill does not mean it is not hugely important.  It does say something about the slow-moving wheels of government that it has taken ten years from the initiation of the review of the potential merger of these three important organisations to finally get the legislation.  That is not the fault of the Minister of State or that of the young officials in attendance, who were probably not in the Department when the review was initiated.  However, it does say something about government overall, which should not pass without comment.<\/p><p>&quot;Surprised&quot; is probably too strong a word for my reaction but I would have expected the Minister of State to comment at some point during his opening or closing remarks on the issues of staffing and savings.  In the regulatory impact analysis of the legislation, which, as the Minister of State knows, was a part of the committee's considerations during pre-legislative scrutiny, there was some brief mention of potential savings.  To be honest, I do not think the savings are going to be very significant.  There will be some at the back end in software, staff, etc.  There were also modest suggestions that there may be some changes in staffing, particularly in respect of recruitment, etc.  It would be helpful if the Minister of State could give us an update on those two matters in advance of Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I echo Deputy Gould's point that if there are any savings, and I am not convinced there will be any, I ask that they are retained within the organisation.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure they go to improving the situation and dealing with some of the issues.  The issue raised most frequently is that of the Land Registry service and the long delays in the registration process and, therefore, the inaccuracy of some of the information that is there.  It can take up to 12 months for a new registration to go live on the site.  That can often cause difficulties in various ways.<\/p><p>I suspect there will not be any changes in staff numbers, which have been pretty constant for the past two years, according to the regulatory analysis.  I would welcome any information the Minister of State could give in that regard.<\/p><p>I am always pleased when he thanks us for the hard work we do in committee with pre-legislative scrutiny.  I just wish that thanks was accompanied by incorporating the recommendations we make in those reports in legislation.  We made two simple recommendations.  I know one of those is not within the gift of the Minister of State, but I do want to speak to it.  If it is a matter he can come back to us on, I would appreciate it.  This would have been an opportune time for the Department of Justice to relinquish control of the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, and to locate it in Tailte &Eacute;ireann. That would have made eminent sense.  I know the members of the relevant Oireachtas committee have very little interest in the PSRA.  I would be surprised if all the members of the Joint Committee on Justice knew the Department has that responsibility.  The difficulty is that the PSRA<b><\/b>is a toothless tiger.  It does not have strong legislative underpinning, nor does it have strong enforcement powers.  Given that we are moving to a period when there is an increase in property transactions and home purchases, albeit that increase is still far too slow, now is the time for us to have proper reform of that key function of our housing market.  I do not believe that will ever happen as long as that agency remains under the auspices of the Department of Justice.  I mean no criticism of that Department but it has many other and more pressing things to deal with.  I believe that if the PSRA was a function of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, located in this new State agency, there would be more of an impetus, given the role of the Ministers of State, the Minister, the officials and us in the Oireachtas committee, to grab the urgent need for reform.  We have an incredibly opaque system for the purchasing of homes.  It is incredibly frustrating, as I am sure the Minister of State knows from his constituents, that the market is so poorly regulated.  The PSRA has no teeth whatsoever.  It has a voluntary code of conduct that is meaningless.  It can write an angrily worded letter if an estate agent, auctioneer or property services agency breaches the code but beyond that, there is nothing there.  The Minister of State could not have controlled that but I would be interested to know, on foot of the recommendation from our committee, if any attempt was made by the Minister, the Ministers of State or officials to engage with the Department of Justice.  Has there been a conversation?  Is that something to which we could return?  I believe it would be of enormous value not just in terms of the technicalities of this Bill, but also in terms of the improvements of land-related issues and property service-related issues, which are ultimately the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State said nothing about this, and I have not seen it in the Bill, but we made a second recommendation during pre-legislative scrutiny for a land transactions register.  We have such a register for house transactions, which provides us with such valuable information on real-time property prices.  As the Minister of State knows, that data is published by the CSO.  Land is probably the most opaque market in the State, bar bitcoin, for those who have a weird interest in that particular phenomenon.  It is virtually impossible to know the price of land at any given time in the marketplace.  All we have are newspaper reports placed there by people either buying or selling land.  It is usually information placed for their own vested interests in individual transactions.  Given the centrality of land values, particularly those for residential development, in the ultimate cost to the purchaser or renter, it would be eminently sensible, logical and desirable for the Government to have a real-time land transaction register.  Maybe that is the intention of the Government; maybe it is a function that will be a consequence of the outworking of this Bill but I suspect not.  If we can have a live register in real time for residential property transactions, we can have one for land.  There is simply no reason in law we could not.  It is one of the small reforms any sensible, active land management policy and strategy by the Government should have.  Again, if the Minister, in advance of Committee Stage or when we deal with these issues - we will table amendments with respect to this on Committee Stage - could return to this matter, that would be very helpful.<\/p> <p> The last issue I will raise is not necessarily pertinent to the Bill, but the merger of the three organisations under the Bill is the right time to address it.  The Minister of State will know that there are very often disputes involving adjoining sites and adjoining title.  In many cases, far too often, the information that is on the Land Registry is not accurate or does not lend itself to resolving disputes over boundary title conflicts.  If I understand the reason correctly, it is that when there was a process of digitisation from the old hard copy OSI mapping of land ownership to the digitised nature of that on the land register, the process did not necessarily happen as accurately as indicated in the Land Registry mission statement outlined by the Minister of State.  I think he used the words, \"accurate\", \"reliable\" and \"readily available\".  The vast majority of times that is the case.  I use the Land Registry and its services a lot.  It is an excellent service with very good staff but there is an issue we need to review and resolve.  One of the useful things the Minister of State could consider, either by way of a friendly amendment by the Opposition on Report Stage or an amendment from the Government, is to build into the legislation an early review by Tailte &Eacute;ireann into what went well and what did not go so well in that digitisation process.  If two people have a dispute over title at a boundary, and if when they both go to the Land Registry the boundary is not clear or there is conflicting information, it is very difficult to resolve.  The more we can keep these types of disputes out of the courts and have some independent mechanism to resolve them in a non-judicial manner, the better for everybody.  This is the time to do it.  I urge the Minister of State to consider that matter and tease it out with us on Committee Stage because it is one that would be mutually beneficial to all Deputies, all property owners and, ultimately, to our system of land management.<\/p> <p> As we said during pre-legislative scrutiny, we support the Bill.  There are merits to it.  If the Minister of State could come back to us - I know he does not have an opportunity to do so at the end of this discussion - even through a short briefing note to the members of the joint committee on the issues I raised, that would be beneficial not just to me but other Members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200039#PP00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663855500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  It is a good idea to bring various offices together that deal with property.  I also welcome the name of new body, Tailte &Eacute;ireann, outlined in the Bill.  It is appropriate.  It is very much in line with the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 that we name our bodies in Irish.  I have noticed over the years, when bodies are named in Irish, especially when they are simple, effective names, that people use them.  Nobody has any difficulty with \"Bus &Eacute;ireann\", for example, or other bodies with Irish language names.  I have never found that new Irish people who come to our country have any particular difficulty with them either.<\/p>  <p>  I am surprised that the residue of the Land Commission has not been incorporated into the provisions of the Bill because many Land Registry documents originated in the dealings of the commission.  As recently as today, I received a query where issues involving the PRA were raised that referred back to commission dealings.  The inquirer now has to contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which can be quite a challenge, to try to get these old Land Commission records.  Residual functions of the commission are land functions.  It divided a lot of land in its time and many people have reason to have recourse to its database.  I am also sure that, for historical purposes, which I raised previously, it would be interesting if those records could be digitised and made publicly available because there is a wealth of social history involved in the enormous work that was carried out by the Land Commission.  It was totally revolutionary in respect of land ownership in this country.  There are still current issues that arise again and again, when looking at land documents that go back to the commission.  It would be much handier if all of these documents relating to ownership and division of land, etc., resided in the one place.<\/p>  <p>  My experience of the PRA, and the Land Registry before it, has been good.  Its staff are generally helpful.  Sometimes, people are frustrated, especially in issues of possessory claims and so on, by the delays involved, but many of these are caused by the fact that people are being given a valuable asset.  PRA staff have to make sure that, as far as they can, it cannot be successfully contested in a court and that it is robust and so on.  This often means going back, when people die intestate and so on, quite a period.  One issue, however, is that we are great at setting up the bodies and creating the work, but, in many circumstances, we do not fully staff these bodies to continue to provide the expanded services they are being asked to provide and queues build up as a result.  Bad public services are inexcusable.<\/p>  <p>  We must provide Tailte &Eacute;ireann staff with cutting edge technology and, as that technology evolves, they must be able to keep to the best standards of technology.  They must also organise themselves in such a way that they use the best work processes available.  Too often, there is a big, good idea, but there is bad execution of it.  We then get the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform being unwilling to provide the necessary staff to cut the queues.  If that Department thinks the current staffing level is sufficient to do a job, it should then do something about perceived inefficiency because bad public services are inexcusable and should not be allowed.  On the other hand, if staff make their case and are doing their jobs efficiently, but cannot keep up with the new demands being created by the Government all the time, and by new circumstances, staff should be provided to do the job.  The other point is that when you start falling behind, and all of us experience this challenge, the queues and delays in dealing with issues create more work.  Ever more resources have to be devoted to deal with the queue rather than the work so it becomes a vortex of inefficiency.  It is important, and we would all support the Government in this, to make sure that this is an efficient service, properly staffed, with well-motivated staff who believe they can do their jobs.<\/p>  <p>  There is one thing I would like to see that should be in every Bill.  I do not know if the Minister of State would consider putting in explicit provision for the right of public representatives to make inquiries.  The Land Registry, and the PRA subsequently, have traditionally been good about dealing with public representatives regarding queries raised that relate to dealings or other Land Registry issues.  Its staff respond very fast.<\/p> <p>That is a good tradition because we are not doing it for ourselves but on behalf of members of the public who are encountering difficulties or delays in getting information.  It is very important that public representatives be entitled, not on a personal level but on a public service level, to get information on behalf of constituents or, as often happens, members of the legal profession who are seeking our assistance to expedite urgent matters.  Where a case is made and when there is a genuine reason for urgency, those matters should be expedited.<\/p> <p> Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille seo.

It has obviously been an incredibly difficult period for the family.  If people have been online, they will have seen the salutations and all that has been said by the likes of Clan na Gael and Shamrocks Football Club, with which young Calvin played.  Not only are my thoughts with the family but I would also like to commend them.  In what was an incredibly difficult time, they took the very brave decision to donate organs.  Other families are now looking at a very bright future as a result of the bravery of this family.  My thoughts are with them.  They are going through a really difficult time.

We support and welcome this Bill although it is alarming to see how long it has taken to get through the process.  That certainly is an eye-opener.  It has taken the best part of ten years.  There was an expectation in 2015 that it would progress at that point.  That shows the length of time involved.  I thank the Minister of State for thanking the joint committee for its work on pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  It is great to get that feedback from him.  We would love to see him taking on our recommendations, especially when we are careful to make only a few recommendations.  On the Bill, we made only two recommendations.  That was all.  I would even have been happy if the Minister of State had decided to support any sort of majority of those recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer of the Property Services Regulatory Authority from the Department of Justice is needed.  When I brought forward my Bill on the land price register, which aims to solve a lot of problems in the housing area, the Department of Justice dealt with it and you could see from the Minister and her officials - and this is not the fault of any of them - that solving the housing situation was not their primary responsibility.  The intent of the legislation I brought forward, solving the housing situation, is not the primary interest of the Department of Justice.  In advancing these matters, it is important that they fall under the right Department's remit.  The Property Services Regulatory Authority has a particular remit with regard to the housing situation but the Department of Justice, which holds it, does not have the same incentive or motivation to advance things on that front.<\/p>  <p>  The second register related to a land price register.  There is some explanation from the Department as to the thinking behind not doing this in the Bill digest prepared by the Library and Research Service.  The Department communicated that a national zoned housing land register was being established and that this was the reason a land price register would not be created.  However, while a national zoned housing land register is welcome, it is a very different thing from a land price register.  We need a land price register.  It would give us some very specific detailed information that we need to ensure transparency around land prices.  In terms of the housing crisis, it is highly regrettable that the Government voted down my Property Services (Land Price Register) Bill 2021 earlier this year.  I would have been very happy to work with the Government to improve the Bill through amendments to deal with any deficiencies it saw in it.  <\/p>  <p>  We need a land price register to create transparency around land prices and developers' margins.  We do not actually know what is going on in terms of housing affordability and construction costs.  The Government has been lobbied continuously to make changes in the areas of housing and planning over recent years and it has brought in a number of changes to policy in these areas.  However, it is reasonable to say that the promises the lobbyists made with regard to housing affordability and extra housing supply on foot of those changes have not come to fruition.  In many ways, the opposite has happened.  A key part of the justification lobbyists for those changes have used has been arguments relating to viability.  They say that housing or specific types of construction are not viable and that the Government needs to make certain changes to make it so.  I mention this in the context of the land price register because we cannot independently scrutinise and analyse arguments on construction costs and viability if we do not know the price of land.  That is a key element.  We cannot properly and independently scrutinise and analyse the various proposals put forward by lobbyists and developers for changes to housing and planning policy - many of which have been adopted - and their arguments around viability if we do not know what is going on with land.  We need that clear data.  We have such data on labour costs, building materials and professional fees but, without knowing what developers are paying for land, we cannot independently assess those proposals and arguments.  This is very important with regard to tackling the cost of delivering the development of land for housing.  The cost of development land is one of the key factors in the construction of housing.  A land price register would fill this gap.  <\/p>  <p>  It would also provide us with important data to allow us to design effective policies to tackle land hoarding and speculation.  According to the Government, we have 8,000 ha of zoned land sitting unused.  That is enough land to build 250,000 homes.  Not having proper data on what is going on with land transactions is inhibiting our ability to develop effective policies in that area.<\/p> <p>Yes, it would be useful to get a better explanation as to why a land price register is not included in the provisions of the Bill but I urge the Government to change its mind on this and make provision for such a register.  I will be bringing forward a number of amendments in that regard.  It is legitimate to ask, given how important land is in terms of housing construction and affordability, why the Government seems to be okay with not knowing what is going on with land prices and transactions.  It is quite incredible in the context of the disaster we are facing.  We have the highest ever house prices and rents in the country and the largest ever number of people living in homelessness.  I have people, especially young people and those in their early 30s, telling me that the only way they feel they will ever be able to afford to live and to move out of their parents' home is if they leave the country.  That is the situation we are facing.  People with lots of the skills we need in our education and healthcare systems, disability services and every other section of the economy and society are leaving.  Indeed, we are losing people with the skills in housing construction that we desperately need.  I urge the Government to take a change of approach on this matter.<\/p> <p> The second issue I want to raise regarding Tailte &Eacute;ireann and the merging of the three offices and their functions relates specifically to the role of the Valuation Office.  I will give an example to illustrate my point.  The office needs to be closed and I will be looking to bring forward an amendment to that end.  The example of the issue I am raising is from my constituency but it applies to lots of other parts of Dublin and elsewhere around the country.  There is an area in my constituency called Clongriffin, much of which was built ten to 15 years ago.  It includes a lot of empty commercial space and vacant commercial units.  In fact, more than 50% of the ground-floor units in this large new townland have never been occupied.  They have been left as shell units, which gives the area a vacant, unfinished feel and means the community has not been able fully to solidify.  There is a revenue loss arising from the lack of commercial rates being brought in, a social cost for the community, a cost to the local businesses as a consequence of reduced footfall and an opportunity cost arising from having buildings empty that should be used for commercial or community purposes.  Leaving those buildings vacant in the middle of a housing crisis is absolutely scandalous.<\/p> <p> What does this have to do with the Valuation Office?  It has everything to do with it because these commercial units that have been empty, some for 15 years, have never been valued for commercial rates by that office.  Dublin City Council does not apply 100% commercial rates exemptions for empty units.  If a commercial unit is empty, the council, like other local authorities, charges a certain percentage of rates, which has gone up in recent years.  Again, this is also the case in local authorities elsewhere.  The purpose of this is to discourage commercial vacancy but those partial rates are not being applied to any of the units to which I referred because they have never been valued by the Valuation Office.<\/p> <p> Other Deputies have talked about delays in some of the other functions being merged into Tailte &Eacute;ireann but there is a huge cost to having commercial units that have never been rated, after ten or 15 years, by the Valuation Office.  I want to see this deep flaw being rectified in the setting up of the new amalgamated body.  There should be some provision such that within a year or two of a unit being substantially completed, it will be valued for commercial rates.  We cannot have a situation where because a unit is not fully fitted out, it is somehow therefore exempt for a decade, 15 years or indefinitely.  That could well be a loophole that may be used with the argument that a unit is not fully completed.  Ten or 15 years on, that is not acceptable.  At what point does a community have a right to expect that the commercial buildings in the locality will be occupied?  To put it in human terms, many of the people who moved into Clongriffin 15 years ago were couples who had no children at the time but went on to start families.  Those children are now 12, 13, 14 and 15 years of age.  Will we have to wait another ten or 15 years, until they are adults and able to move out, before the community begins to settle?  As I said, this is an example from my constituency but it applies to newer developments in many other areas.  I will be bringing forward amendments on this but I urge the Minister of State to consider the issue and to look favourably at those amendments.<\/p> <p> This Bill is welcome and it is good that it has cross-party support.  However, we must consider whether we can strengthen it to ensure Tailte &Eacute;ireann is able to fulfil the maximum role it can in helping to combat vacancy and to alleviate the housing crisis by way of the provision of land price data and transparency around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200041#RR00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663856700,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I do not have an objection to what the Minister of State is doing but there are a few issues on which we need clarification.  Regarding the PRA, everything used to be based in Dublin but it now has a branch in Roscommon.  In fairness, the work it does in Roscommon is mighty for people in the west of Ireland.  That is the first thing to say.<\/p>  <p>  I want to get my head around how the merger is to be done.  Will the three bodies work from the same place and will there be more expertise?  It has happened many a time over the years, especially at the time of the building boom, that a boundary line was put in the wrong spot.  If one has to go to the PRA and try to have co-ordination between all the bodies involved to get the issue resolved, it can be a massive problem.  Letters go over and back and up and down.  It would be great to have a type of one-stop shop in which someone could grab the bull by the horns and say that section over there will work with this section here to make sure issues are resolved.  I am trying to get my head around a scenario where there may be different offices in different places.  I presume and hope there is no plan to close any offices in the west of Ireland.  It is invaluable to have a PRA office in Roscommon, compared with the situation at one time where people had to go to the Phoenix Park, if I recall it right, to do some of their business.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the Land Commission, there are two offices, one of which is in Cavan and the other in Portlaoise.  It depends on the era one is inquiring about as to which location one needs to go to get the particular materials that are needed.  There is another part of the Land Commission located in Dublin, which I understand is under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That body is pretty good, in fairness to it, but there is the question of knowing where to go.  I would be all for a one-stop shop to which people could go if there is a problem.  In Roscommon, people can go into the PRA office and someone will sit down with them and go through their problem.  If we had that type of co-ordination between the three bodies, it would be a great system for resolving issues that crop up.  If there is a lot of building going on, mistakes will happen and there is no point saying they will not, but it is about being able to rectify those mistakes.<\/p>  <p>  The previous speaker referred to buildings lying idle and said we should be pulling rates out of them.  Some people might not remember but in 2008 or 2009, we had a bit of a crash and for ten or 11 years afterwards, there were a lot of buildings around the country for which there was no pick-up.  That is the reality.  Thankfully, we now have things like town and village renewal schemes, more rural regeneration, digital hubs and people working from home.<\/p> <p>That gives some of them the opportunity to get back into action.  In fairness, most people who have a building, especially in rural areas - I cannot talk about Dublin because I am not qualified to do that - if they can get someone to rent it or make use of it they will be damn glad to do it.  Thankfully, a lot of them are getting up and running again, which is good.  It brings in more rates.<\/p> <p> Valuations are fairly contentious.  A valuation might be done in places that may not be as affluent as other areas and people will say it is a high valuation.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State or his Department might pick up on this for areas around the country that might be in difficulty.  Some councils have brought this in but it was not uniform.  That is the problem.  If someone set up a new business, and this was a massive idea in Roscommon County Council, and there was no one doing the same thing within 10 km, they would get the rates off the first year and 80% off the next year.  That would go on over a five-year period and was an incentive to get that person up and running in business.  That is a good thing.  If more councils around the country did that, it would encourage entrepreneurs.  At the end of the day, the more businesses in an area, the more people will be working locally and it will put less pressure on the likes of Dublin.<\/p> <p> The document and the summary document use the word \"decentralisation\".  That word was thrown around the place years ago.  In fairness, there is nothing wrong with the idea of decentralisation.  How it was done was the problem.  The services have to be brought closer to the people.  Years ago, people in the west would have to try to get to Dublin if there was a problem with the property registration and at that time it was a long road through all the small towns.  Now there is a great service in Roscommon and great staff in there to help people.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for giving me the opportunity to speak ahead of him.  I do not oppose the Bill but I ask the Minister of State to set out the vision for how things will be.  Will there be a one-stop shop?  There are many places that are invaluable, especially in the west of Ireland for people with property on the other side of the River Shannon.  I ask the Minister to expand on that and give us an idea of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200042#SS00200","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663857300,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Cos&uacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; eile at&aacute; tar &eacute;is labhairt, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an mBille seo.

I will go through some of the contributions and respond to them before I make some concluding remarks.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gould raised the issue of staffing levels.  I will not go into any details on that but I believe the staffing levels will be maintained.  On increasing staffing, resources and the money-saving element, the Bill is not intended to do that.  It is intended rather to achieve efficiency and a more streamlined approach.  I believe all Members are agreed on this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gould also spoke of public land banks, managing data, and the role of Tailte &Eacute;ireann with other agencies such as the Land Development Agency, LDA.  The Deputy specifically and consistently speaks about dereliction, vacancy, and the registry of derelict sites, particularly as it pertains to Cork.  Obviously, while the Bill is a technical Bill in the context of the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann and does not specifically deal with dereliction, Deputy Gould makes consistent points with regard to Cork and the dereliction that has been highlighted by Jude Sherry and others over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to staffing, savings and the regulatory impact analysis that was carried out.  I will give a commitment on a number of the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I note that Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Cian O'Callaghan raised the issues and the recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I take those on board.  Deputy O'Callaghan has signalled intent to bring forward amendments.  I welcome the debates that will ensue on those amendments.  I take on board absolutely the point on a briefing note.  There was a question on the process of digitisation and a review of that.  That is a worthwhile exercise.  I certainly believe we can give a commitment to that.  We can provide any additional briefing note the Deputy requires.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v welcomed the naming of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  The Deputy brought up interesting points around the Land Commission, the incorporation of records, the digitisation of those records and making them publicly available.  That is a very valid point.  These do have a huge social and cultural value and it is something we could consider.  There is also the right of public representatives to direct access when representing the public.  When public representatives have any interactions with State agencies, it is important we, collectively, have that access.  It is vitally important.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan raised the issue around the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, and the land price register.  The Deputy has made some very valid points in that regard.  Deputy O'Callaghan has offered to work with the Government to improve his Bill.  There is an opportunity to do that if those conversations should be had.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also spoke about the role of the Valuation Office and gave the example of Clongriffin and the empty retail units.  These issues in urban areas must be addressed.  I believe it was a common practice in developments around 15 or 20 years ago to have retail units at the base and apartments for people living above.  This never matched the demand that was there for retail and they could never be filled.  It happened not just in Dublin but also in large urban centres throughout the State.  It needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the comments from Deputy Fitzmaurice on the Property Registration Authority in Roscommon and the idea of the one-stop shop.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh as na point&iacute; maidir leis na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a cheangal le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all Deputies for their valuable contributions to the debate on the Bill today.  The constructive debate we had today follows on from the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny given by the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to the general scheme of the Bill a year ago.  I fully appreciate the support that has been expressed for the Bill.  I will now address some of the points raised.<\/p>  <p>  On the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations, the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage recommended that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage engage with the Department of Justice to consider integrating the Property Services Regulatory Authority with Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  The primary role of the PSRA is to regulate property services providers, namely, auctioneers and estate agents, letting agents and property management agents.<\/p> <p>Following consultation with the Department of Justice, it is considered that the functions of the PSRA are not sufficiently closely aligned with the functions of the bodies already identified for Tailte &Eacute;ireann, being the registration of deeds and title, site surveying and the valuation of rateable property.<\/p> <p> The joint committee further recommended that Tailte &Eacute;ireann be given, as one of its statutory functions, responsibility for maintaining a publicly accessible, searchable, electronic register of land transactions that would include the price, location, size, zoning, date of sale and ownership details.  This new register would operate on a similar basis to the existing residential property price register.<\/p> <p> The supply of housing is inextricably linked to the supply of land and its capacity for development.  Under action 28.2 of Housing for All, the Department is currently working with Ordnance Survey Ireland to develop a national zoned housing land register based on local authority development plans, including the potential housing yield or capacity, which can also form the basis for the associated calculation of land use values required for the land value sharing measures that are currently being developed.  This is considered to be a more appropriate mechanism for dealing with the issues that the proposal seeks to address.  I know Deputy Cian O'Callaghan will bring forward amendments so there will be further opportunity to debate these issues.<\/p> <p> On the appointment process for the chief executive and the board, the chief executive will be appointed by the Minister following open competition through the Public Appointments Service and in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The Bill provides that where a competition to appoint a chief executive is held before the establishment day, the successful candidate shall be appointed by the Minister to be the first chief executive of Tailte &Eacute;ireann on establishment day.  Recruitment for the position of chief executive will be managed by the top level appointments committee, TLAC.<\/p> <p> In relation to the board of Tailte &Eacute;ireann it is intended that Board membership will consist of a chairperson and six ordinary members who will be appointed by the Minister following open competition through the Public Appointments Service and in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. <\/p> <p> The Bill provides that the Minister may, where he or she considers it necessary having regard to the volume of business coming before Tailte &Eacute;ireann and the need to ensure the effective and efficient discharge by Tailte &Eacute;ireann of its functions, by order, increase the number of members of the board to not more than 12 for such period as the Minister shall specify, up to a maximum period of two years.  There is no provision in the Bill for certain nominees to the board. <\/p> <p> I now turn to the benefits of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  There is a broad understanding now that Tailte &Eacute;ireann, as a single entity focused on the production and maintenance of core-reference data focused on land ownership and land value, will deliver benefits to the State.  The provision of high quality, reliable, trusted and maintained geospatial information is essential for a wide range of critical State functions from environmental planning and management, to the effective administration of property and land use.  Streamlining services into one entity with its own Vote of expenditure and headed by a single chief executive and board will allow Tailte &Eacute;ireann to efficiently take advantage of the national geospatial data hub GeoHive that has been developed by Ordnance Survey Ireland, and will be able it to combine and integrate the wealth of authoritative land information held by the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office, the OSI and other public bodies, to provide citizens, business and policy makers with new land Information products and services.  It will provide a single point of access for land and property information and related services such as property and title information, property valuation data, maps and aerial imagery.  When established, Tailte &Eacute;ireann will be staffed by more than 900 civil servants with a wide variety of quality management skills, technical skills and experience.  Development is under way by the Commissioners of Public Works on a building, the Distillers Building in Smithfield, which will act as a Civil Service and Government accommodation hub, including providing office accommodation for the Dublin-based staff of Tailte &Eacute;ireann. <\/p> <p> The establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann will bring savings in the short- to medium-term from the consolidation of common back-office functions such as HR, conventional ICT systems, financial management and from a potential reduction in costs such as software licensing.  The establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann will also provide for a less crowded administrative landscape by reducing the number of state bodies in line with Government policy.  A project board has been put in place under the chairmanship of my Department to oversee the successful establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  Staff of the three agencies are being kept informed of developments. <\/p> <p> At the beginning, I outlined the provisions of this Bill which is focused on the merging of the three bodies and the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  As highlighted previously, this is largely technical legislation which is primarily designed to establish the merged Tailte &Eacute;ireann organisation in the most efficient way.  Accordingly, there are no significant new policy initiatives contained in this legislation.  Rather, in line with similar legislation, the Bill is focused on the statutory provisions necessary to bring about the merger of the three existing organisations into the new Tailte &Eacute;ireann organisation, the governance of the new organisation when it is established and the carrying out of its functions into the future.  I hope that when we vote on this Bill it will continue to receive the support of the House.  I thank all Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200044#UU00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663858500,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Tailte \u00c9ireann Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1663858500,"counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200045#VV00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1663858500,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200045#VV00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1663858500,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1663858500,"counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200045#VV00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","time":1663858500,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200045#VV00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1663858500,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Across the State, tens of thousands of homeowners, private and social housing tenants, are living in defective buildings with defective blocks and pyrite in the foundations but also many with fire safety, water ingress and other structural defects.  All those people are waiting very anxiously on next week's budget announcements to see what, if anything, the Government has in store for them.  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to make the case for the need for substantial amendment to the defective block remediation legislation as well as a significant increase in funding for those homeowners.  However, what I want to talk about here is the working group on defective housing.<\/p>  <p>  Only last week, myself and my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, met a very large number of residents in a residential development in Park West in Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's constituency and on the boundary of mine.  They are apartment owners, the overwhelming majority of whom bought homes in good faith, who are now facing bills individually of &euro;60,000 to &euro;70,000 each to remediate that property.  Those people, like tens of thousands of others across the State, definitely need a remediation scheme and it needs to have significant funding in addition to whatever funding is provided for pyrite and defective block schemes.  That scheme also needs to be retrospective for those homeowners who, whether under pressure from insurers or fire safety officials, have had to remediate their properties or parts of their properties to date.  There will also be a need for some sort of interim measures for those who need to urgently need to remediate their properties now.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's strong view is that the best way to do this is to take the pyrite resolution board that is currently in place and expand its terms of reference so that homeowners affected by Celtic tiger-era defects, which they did not cause, can immediately apply to that body.  It is almost finished its work in terms of pyrite.  The Government estimates that there are a few hundred homeowners left.  That way, rather than setting up a new grant scheme and having to go through the whole process again, we would take the structure that is there and give it additional funding.  Crucially, the advantage of doing that would be that it would not be a grant scheme like we have in Donegal and Mayo and now Clare and Limerick.  Those schemes are not fit for purpose.  Given the complex nature of multi-unit residential developments and the fact that they are not individual owners with an individual discrete unit but an owners' management company with collective ownership of the shared areas, an end-to-end scheme managed by the Pyrite Resolution Board, albeit probably renamed, would be an eminently sensible way to do that as well as reducing the costs ultimately to the Exchequer as well.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to hear from the Minister of State.  I know he will not tell me what is in the budget - I am not asking why he cannot answer that particular question as somebody else can do that - but I ask that he would at least give us some sense of what has happened since the working group's report was given to the Government in the summer of this year.  What is the Government's thinking on how to deal with this?<\/p> <p>I can attest - Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh would say the same - to what I heard from the homeowners we met last week.  I meet homeowners like these from throughout the country, from counties Clare, Donegal and Mayo as well as from across Dublin and the commuter belt counties.  In some cases, they have been waiting for 15 years to get some indication of whether there will be any scheme at all.  They did not create these defects.  They bought homes in good faith.  While they share the view of many of us that in the first instance the developer responsible should foot the bill, for many reasons in many cases it is not possible to pursue the developer.  The Statute of Limitations may have been exceeded.  The developer may no longer be trading or has created a new designated activity company, trading under another name.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to outline where the Government is at.  Can we expect some form of scheme to be in place from 2023 to give these homeowners the much-needed respite they rightly deserve and desperately need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200045#VV00700","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663859100,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I am happy to provide an update on the working group.  I acknowledge the considerable challenges and stress this has placed on families.  I acknowledge the difficulties that homeowners and residents of many apartments and duplexes are facing, and the stress that is caused when defects arise in their buildings.  The Deputy will be aware that there have been many incidents of failures and non-compliance concerns coming to light in apartment buildings built during the building boom.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has repeatedly said that this is a nettle which the Government needs to and will grasp, and that the Government is committed to helping affected homeowners.<\/p>  <p>  One of the first tasks of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, following the formation of the Government was the establishment of an independent working group to examine defects in housing under the chairmanship of Mr. Seamus Neely, the former chief executive of Donegal County Council.  This followed a commitment in the programme for Government to examine the issue and bring forward reforms.  This commitment was further supported by actions contained in Housing for All.<\/p>  <p>  The group&rsquo;s terms of reference were focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose-built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, received the report of the working group at the end of July.<\/p>  <p>  The content of this report confirms what we already know, which is that there is a significant and widespread issue with defects in a large number of apartments and duplexes that were built during the Celtic tiger years.<\/p>  <p>  The working group estimates that of apartments and duplexes or associated common areas constructed between 1991 and 2013, the number that may be affected by one or more fire safety, structural safety or water ingress defects is likely to range between 50% and 80%.  This equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 apartments or duplexes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the working group estimates that the average cost of undertaking the remediation of defects is likely to be approximately &euro;25,000 per apartment or duplex.  This translates into a potential overall total remediation cost ranging from approximately &euro;1.56 billion to &euro;2.5 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The working group concluded that there is no single cause of defects.  They tend to arise due to a variety of design, product, inspection, supervision and workmanship issues, occurring either in isolation or in various combinations.<\/p>  <p>  The working group made recommendations on the planning, prioritisation and resourcing of all remedial works.

There were ten paragraphs in his speech.  There was half a paragraph containing one sentence in response to the question I asked.  I hope after next week's budget announcements homeowners will be somewhat the wiser as to the Government's intentions.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues constantly raised by homeowners and their representatives through the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners Network is the anger that those responsible are not contributing anything.  If a redress scheme is announced in the budget, it will rightly be primarily funded by the Government, but we need to make sure industry pays.<\/p>  <p>  Two companies were responsible for defects in the apartments and duplexes in Belmayne in north County Dublin.  Kitara still trades.  Stanley Holdings was reconstituted and the directors of that are now the directors of Cairn Homes, one of the largest home builders in the State.  Much to the anger of homeowners in Belmayne, Cairn Homes is building a huge new residential development with significant support from the State on the land directly beside them.  Homeowners do not understand why individuals or companies who in the past were responsible for defects get significant support, planning permission, State aid and support from NAMA to build homes and make enormous profits.  Michael Stanley of Cairn Homes is a case in point.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that in reply to a parliamentary question in July, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, indicated to me that the Government is considering imposing a levy on industry to ensure it pays its fair share.  My strong view is that it should be euro for euro because the Government has a responsibility for decades of light-touch regulation.  For every &euro;1 the State pays for remediation, &euro;1 should come from industry.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope the Government will support my sentiment that developers that continue to trade either as individuals or as companies should be brought to bear.  For example, the homeowners in Belmayne who are facing substantial costs to address defects should not only get support from the State and industry but also from those individuals and companies who are making enormous profits despite the fact that in a piece of land next to where they are building homeowners have been left with defects for over a decade and a half.  Can the Minister of State give me any update on the attempts being made by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to get industry to make a contribution?

It is an issue with which all public representatives are familiar.  I was somewhat at sea on the last occasion because I did not have as much information as I would have liked to have been able to present to the House.  Since then, I did some research and was astounded at some of the things I found.  It was suggested to me that there might have been the development of an anti-women element in the courts.<\/p><p>Women were not getting their rights as mothers as in the case I mentioned.  She has particular rights as the primary carer and custodian of the children and rights under guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  These were not observed and were dismissed or rejected by the court.  Subsequently the children in this case were accosted in school by garda&iacute; on foot of an order from the courts and were brought to the other side - to the respondent in the case, which was obviously a case in the divorce courts.  The children were taken away from their mother and placed in the custody of the former spouse of the litigant.<\/p> <p>I concluded, as you would conclude, a Cheann Comhairle, having dealt with these matters for many years - and other Members as well - that there must be something there that we did not observe.  I did some more research and I then discovered that the mother was accused of attempting to turn the children against the father, who had been removed from the house some years previously on foot of a serious issue.  The case persisted, to the extent that the mother was warned that if she approached a public representative, Tusla or anybody else, to plead her case there would be recriminations for which she would pay in the short and long term.  It would appear now that her offence is that she is accused by an accuser, supported by the court, of trying to turn the family against the father.  The most important point is that allegation was never challenged.  The judge in question decided not to hear the case, which went against her, and since last May she has not had an occasion to meet her children except by way of telephone call.  There were repeated admonitions from the solicitor for the other side pointing out that if she persisted, this would be taken into account against her.<\/p> <p> I did some other research.  You will be interested in this as well, a Cheann Comhairle.  I researched a number of cases that I had dealt with over the years.  I found that there was a pattern, which appeared to be misogynistic and to address what was referred to as the women's issue, whereby women were seen to be too powerful and were getting too much of their way in the courts and the aim was to redress that.  Everybody is entitled to their day in court and to due process and natural justice.  They might not always win, but there must be an opportunity where the questions are asked quite strongly by the opposing side in order to verify the case.  That is their right.  It is also their right to have an alternative court-appointed child psychologist, psychologist or messenger of the court, as it may be, to deal with the issue if necessary in order that justice prevails.  That is the information I have so far.  You will be interested, a Cheann Comhairle, in the next piece of information that I will not have for another week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200046#WW00700","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663859700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Before I call the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I want to say that we heard some of this case last week when the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, was here to deal with it from the point of view of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

I will keep to the script on this so that we can continue with the story.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this important matter here today and for giving me the opportunity to provide clarity on some issues.  Management of the courts, operational matters and logistical functions are the responsibility of the Judiciary and the Courts Service, which are independent in exercising their functions under the Courts Service Act 1998 and given the separation of powers in the Constitution.  As such, I am unable to comment on the specific matters raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Section 47 of the Family Law Act 1995 provides that the Circuit Court or High Court may order a report in writing on any question affecting the welfare of a party to family law proceedings or any other person to whom they relate.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 32(1) of the 1964 Act provides that in such proceedings, the court may do either or both of the following: give directions for the purpose of procuring a written report from an expert on any question affecting the welfare of the child; or appoint an expert to determine and convey the child's views.  Assessors and experts in family law proceedings are formally appointed by the court, and answer to the presiding judge in a specific case.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is determined to overhaul the operation of the family justice system, to ensure that we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts the family at the centre of its work.  This is a key commitment in the Minister's Justice Plan 2022.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a family court Bill to create a new dedicated family court within the existing courts structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes.  The purpose of the legislation is the establishment of a dedicated family court to improve levels of judicial expertise and training in family law matters and to streamline family law proceedings, thereby making them more user-friendly and less costly.<\/p>  <p>  The general scheme of the family court Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and drafting is progressing with a view to publication of the Bill as soon as possible in this D&aacute;il session.  The Minister also established a family justice oversight group to develop the first national strategy for the reform of the family justice system and to support the legislative changes proposed in the planned family court Bill.  The focus of the group is to drive and co-ordinate the modernisation of the family justice system to make it more user-friendly, streamlined, supportive and, where possible, less adversarial.  The terms of reference of the group include developing a high-level vision and medium and long-term objectives for the development of an effective national family justice system.  This will be most obvious in the development of the first family justice strategy and its subsequent implementation.  The strategy is currently being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its work to develop the strategy, the group engaged in a consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look.  A number of common issues were raised and are being considered for inclusion in the emergent family justice strategy, including: a greater focus on children; the availability of and access to support services; the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes; and, where possible, appropriate training and information dissemination and awareness raising.  One of the areas being considered by the group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system.  The family court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge, and ongoing professional training in the area of family law will be required to be appointed as a family court judge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200047#XX00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1663859700,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for coming into the House and addressing the issue comprehensively.

Like the Minister of State and other Members of the House, in the past I have had to go into court as a witness in such cases.  Not everybody welcomed me with open arms but I did what I felt I had to do.  As they say, fair play is good sport, wherever it applies.

All views, opinions and experiences submitted as part of this consultation have been welcomed and those responses received are under review.

I know the line Department will be watching this.  I know the Minister of State will bring back the content and comments faithfully.  She has done so before and I really appreciate it.<\/p>  <p>  Neighbours of mine was very excited recently because their son gained a place in UCD having done the leaving cert.  We were chatting about induction week and I asked how the son was going to get to UCD.  I said there was a bus from outside the estate, route 175.  Then the local and strong organisation, Knocklyon Network, was inundated on its Facebook page in the past week with comments from residents asking them to raise the issue with local public representatives.  I said I would do my best and try to raise it on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I waited until today, but it has been a busy week.  I assure any of them who are watching that I have raised it with the National Transport Authority, the NTA, and I have written and communicated directly with the managing director of Go-Ahead Ireland, which is responsible for three of the four routes I will raise.<\/p>  <p>  The first is route 175.  It runs through Ballyboden in my constituency through Scholarstown and Knocklyon and serving Ballycullen, Firhouse, Old Bawn, into Tallaght village, past The Square and out to City West.  In that area there are hospitals, schools, colleges, a business park, industrial estates and major employment centres.  It is a critical route.  It passes a number of schools, particularly Educate Together schools, but others also, including pupils from outside the catchment area.  The schools are utterly dependent on bus services.<\/p>  <p>  The second is route 75, which runs from Tallaght to D&uacute;n Laoghaire via Dundrum.  I see the Acting Chair is nodding his head.  That route starts in The Square in Tallaght, and shoppers and employees depend on it.  Again, it goes through Old Bawn, Rathfarnham shopping centre, Rathfarnham village and passes schools.  It connects out to Dundrum Luas.  It is a vital link.  It also connects to the Stillorgan shopping centre.<\/p>  <p>  The third is route 27 from Jobstown passing, for example, the Coombe Hospital, Crumlin shopping centre, Kilnamanagh, which has a great shopping centre, Tallaght Luas, Tallaght Hospital and Tallaght village.  These are critical routes.<\/p>  <p>  The final one is route 17 which only spends minutes in my constituency, passing through Rathfarnham.<\/p>  <p>  There have been failures in timetables, cancelled bus routes and the disappearance of bus times from timetables.  I particularly feel for students who at this time have just started their school year.  They are excited about it.  We are trying to keep cars off the road.  These are vulnerable times, including early in the morning and late at night.  We can picture a young adult, a young woman maybe, standing at a bus stop and the bus not turning up.  The person has to wait by themselves for another 45 minutes to an hour for the next bus to come.<\/p>  <p>  I have a few more comments to make in the second part of my contribution, but that essentially outlines the background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200048#YY00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1663860300,"counter":417,"content":"<p>After what I am about to read, the Deputy will certainly have a few more comments to make.  I thank Deputy Lahart for raising this important topic which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is in relation to the impact on second and third level students, and other commuters, when buses on the 75, 175, 27 and 17 routes fail to operate according to schedule leaving commuters and students abandoned and stranded at bus stops and to learn how this is being addressed by the bus operators.<\/p>  <p>  I further understand that the issue of service reliability on these routes was raised by both Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Lawless earlier this morning during Oral Questions with the Minister for Transport.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset, I note that the Department for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those public service obligation routes currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland.  It is the National Transport Authority that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport service contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.  PSO services are socially necessary but financially unviable services and the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  Funding support has increased in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the vast majority of PSO bus services are provided by either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann through what are known as direct award contracts.  The remaining routes are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, which entered the market in September 2018 as part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to open-up the bus market through a programme of tendering known as &ldquo;Bus Market Opening&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.  To support this objective, in Budget 2022 the Department of Transport secured &euro;538 million of funding for PSO and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenues.  I am advised that to date passenger numbers remain below pre-Covid levels and demand is currently at 90% of that experienced in 2019 during the week and ahead of pre-pandemic levels at weekends.<\/p>  <p>  \ufeffIn the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question regarding the 75 and 175 routes currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, I have been advised that the performance of all public transport operators is monitored by the NTA as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators.<\/p> <p>I have been further advised that Go-Ahead Ireland is not alone in experiencing these issues and many operators in the public transport sector are facing challenges with staffing both as a result of Covid-19-related absences and with regard to recruiting new drivers.<\/p> <p> However, while these staffing issues are being experienced by both commercial and PSO operators, it is also true that Go-Ahead Ireland is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences at present.  These absences are having a knock-on effect on service delivery with some services not operating as scheduled.<\/p> <p> I understand that the NTA is working with Go-Ahead Ireland to try to mitigate the impacts through recruitment campaigns, engagement with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, regarding the testing and licence process for new bus drivers and by working with Go-Ahead Ireland to minimise service cancellations, ensure first-service and last-service buses operate and on low-frequency routes to avoid, where possible, the cancellation of consecutive low-frequency services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200048#YY00400","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663860900,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State; she made a valiant effort  I am about to blow a gasket, really.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1663860900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1663860900,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I appreciate it.

All four routes that brought to the Minister of State's attention are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland.  I have found that the NTA tends to be much more sympathetic towards Go-Ahead Ireland in its parliamentary responses in terms of excusing this and that.  Three quarters of the Minister of State's response was about the background of the response provided to her tonight.  There is no suggestion or answer as to how this will be addressed, or what those second-level and third-level students, workers, hospital visitors, hospital workers, supermarket workers and people doing their shopping will do tomorrow when they are standing at a bus stop anywhere between Citywest and Ballyboden and every stop in between when their bus does not show up.  In the case of students, they may be lucky enough to have parents who have a car on the road to get them to college or school or else they will have to find an alternative route.<\/p>  <p>  I chaired the session on parliamentary questions to the Minister for Transport this morning when the Minister was in the Chamber and I did see and hear that.  The Minister needs to call the NTA in now and say this is totally unacceptable.  A good part of the Minister of State's answer revolved around how much the State invests in the public service obligation, PSO, contracts.

Buses and drivers will have to be found for those constituents in my constituency and beyond who are left stranded at bus stops where timetables are not met but are still advertised as running according to normal.

It is safe to say we both agree how important sport is in Irish society.  We are a real sporting nation.  It is one of the pillars that sustains Irish society.  Whether it is at grassroots or amateur level or supporting our elite athletes and teams wherever they represent us, we simply love sport.<\/p>  <p>  Sporting organisations play a major role in community development and in fostering stronger social cohesion.  An average of one in ten of all adults frequently volunteer within local sporting clubs.  The economic value of volunteering for sports alone in 2018 was approximately &euro;1.5 billion per annum.  The impact of this is felt far beyond the pitches of our local sports clubs.  These additional and often less spoken-of benefits are often some of the most profound.  The negative effects of dropping out of supervised sporting activities are also extensive, ranging from increased substance misuse and poor school grades to widening the socioeconomic gap.  Research from Sport Ireland has shown the impact that social class has on sporting participation.  Only 47% of our children from a lower socioeconomic class grouping will continue some form of sport post primary, while 65% from high social class groupings will participate in post-primary community sport.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that sports continue to play this vital role, support for modern facilities needs to be provided.  Despite the clear benefits of sports in our society, Ireland comes bottom of the table in the EU in general when it comes to investing in sports and recreational activities.  The Irish Government is a persistent underfunder of sports and recreational activities.  Our EU peer group spends on average three times more on sports and recreation than that of Ireland.  When the large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, was launched in 2018, it was widely welcomed right across the sporting community, which felt that the Government was finally moving in the right direction and introducing adequate funding for major projects.  This was seen as a much-needed Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, since the first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020, very little has progressed.  Approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  However, only approximately &euro;900,000 has been paid out to projects. As we all know, building costs have skyrocketed since 2020.  Questions must be asked as to how many of these projects are viable under increased building costs.  Where projects are facing difficulties, will the Minister of State intervene with support for these sporting infrastructure projects?  Capital projects funded through the LSSIF are capped at 70% of the total project.  Has the Minister of State considered increasing the cap in view of rising building and construction costs?<\/p>  <p>  The cost-of-living crisis is having a severe impact on the financial resources of clubs and national governing bodies, NGBs, across the State.  As we enter the winter months, the floodlights will be back on and in action on a nightly basis.  This will see increased costs for clubs and local authorities.  We will see basketball halls across the State filling up, with basketball being one of our most popular winter sports.  Many clubs are being pushed to the edge just trying to cover the cost of energy bills.<\/p> <p>Can the Minister of State give a commitment that swimming pools, which are expensive to run, will get the funding they need to stay open and that they will not close?  Resources for new facilities will be tighter than ever before.  Is the Government confident that the 33 proposals awarded funding through the LSSIF will be delivered and when will the Department review on the LSSIF be published?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200049#ZZ01200","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663861500,"counter":431,"content":"<p>This is a single Topical Issue matter but multiple topics are being raised so I will try to deal with some of them.  The LSSIF was launched in 2018 by the previous Government to provide an open and transparent system for applying for funding for larger sports facility projects, including swimming pools, where the amount being sought by applicants was greater than the funding available under my Department's sports capital and equipment programme.  The first call for proposals was confined to sporting bodies and local authorities.  Following a detailed assessment process, the first allocations under the fund were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been allocated to 33 different proposals.  It should be noted in all cases that the funding provided by the Department represents a proportion of the overall cost of the project and it was a requirement for all applicants to show a minimum of 30% own funding for their proposals.<\/p>  <p>  I know there is huge ambition in the sporting system, including for the projects that have received funding, for projects that were given funding for planning and design and for projects that have been developed since that time.  Drawdown of these funds is not where I want it to be but it should be noted that the allocations were announced in January 2020, just prior to the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The pandemic gave rise to significant financial challenges and delays in construction for all grantees, with many of them having to reprioritise their expenditure plans due to significant reductions in their income streams.  The Government provided significant support during that period, with a massive expansion in direct funding for sporting organisations and clubs to keep them afloat.  In more recent times, the high rate of construction inflation has also resulted in grantees pausing some projects until they are in a position to secure the balance of the funding required to complete works.  From my Department's perspective, every effort has been made and there has been direct engagement with all applicants to advance all projects as efficiently as possible.  While the priority remains to advance all the successful projects, as it is now two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of Covid, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects that were allocated grants.  My Department has met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in completing the review.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the efficiency of the scheme.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the funding provided under the LSSIF is substantial and, accordingly, the Government is trying to get value for money.  While overseeing the spending of public money on capital works, it is a requirement to ensure that projects adhere to the public spending code.  In the case of some of the projects awarded funds, delays were encountered, with grantees completing the due diligence procedures to allow a grant agreement to issue.  It should be noted however, that letters have issued to 16 of the grantees, confirming that the Department is satisfied with the economic appraisals and other documentation submitted and is happy to proceed to the grant agreement stage.  Furthermore, it is encouraging that based on the discussions with grantees, 22 of the 33 projects should be in a position to draw down funding in 2023.  Accordingly, I expect significant progress on many of these projects in the short term.  In the context of ongoing increases in construction costs, other projects will require additional funding to progress and I am aware of the broader ambition that existed across the sporting system to deliver additional large sporting infrastructure.  Delivering on that ambition will require significant further investment and this is something I have ongoing engagements on with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referenced a league table, although he did not say where he got it from.  I question his data because we announced more than &euro;160 million for the sports capital and equipment programme earlier this year, the largest ever investment in grassroots sport.  That demonstrates a massive expansion in our delivery for the sporting system and for clubs and communities.  This Government has been committed to delivering that.  We are seeing massive drawdown of funding within clubs.  We are seeing all-weather pitches being built, equipment being delivered and all sorts of delivery across the sporting system.  I accept that we have to make further progress on this but the update I have given the Deputy demonstrates that drawdown for those 22 projects will occur in the short term.  There is progress but I accept that there have been delays during that two-year window.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200050#AAA00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1663861500,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I acknowledge what he and the Government did for sporting organisations during the pandemic.  As he said, it kept many clubs afloat and it is important to acknowledge that.  However, we are in another pandemic and there is a lot of talk in advance of the budget on household supports, which are vital, as well as business supports.  Equally, there will be sports clubs that will need to be kept afloat.  If you go to any park the floodlights will be on and swimming pools need to be kept open, even though they are costly.  Many clubs that are drawing down these grants and other funds are struggling and it is important that a lifeline is thrown to them.  The Minister of State said that 22 of the 33 clubs had progressed their applications but for the rest we need to ensure that where they need funding they get it and the sports organisations should not be allowed to die as a result of a lack of commitment by Government.  The Government did not let the clubs go during the pandemic and I seek that sort of commitment and support to be continued during this energy pandemic for sports clubs.  As I said earlier, the template we need to follow is that of the League of Ireland and Shamrock Rovers' facilities.  We need to ensure those sort of projects and that sort of funding are provided for the League of Ireland, basketball, hockey and cricket.

We are focused on participation grants that resulted from Covid.

We are also clear when it comes to our ambition for the LSSIF and 22 of the projects will advance shortly while there is a funding gap for some of the others.  Some of that is not specifically related to funding but to other matters that have to be concluded.  These are large multimillion euro projects and it is not simply a funding question.  Some of them have not been able to advance for other reasons.  There is proactive work by the LSSIF division in my Department.

I am more than happy, as are my Labour Party colleagues, to work with the Minister on what is a very important Bill.  The Minister probably knows from her own experience - although maybe not this week when there was huge, intensive interest in pensions more generally - that when we discuss tensions people&rsquo;s eyes tend to glaze over.  That is unfortunate.<\/p><p>We are were living in the midst of a serious cost-of-living crisis.  We have all seen the basic prices of food, energy of housing and of basic goods escalate before our eyes over the past year.  Too many people have experienced firsthand the permanent cost-of-living crisis in our dysfunctional housing market.  Often when I talk about housing, I describe it as the most significant investment anybody is likely to make in their lifetime.  The second most important investment anybody is likely to make involves taking out private occupational pension.  One would imagine that we would have the same kind of interest and the same kind of transparency, dare I say it, around pensions as we have in the context of mortgage products.  However, the reality is that we simply do not.  When it comes to pensions, the fees and charges that are associated with those unnecessarily complex products are rarely understood.  This is despite such products often being the second most significant investment we will make during our working lives.<\/p><p>Such a lack of understanding is not due to ignorance or a want of trying.  It is no reflection on people who might consider themselves, rightly and objectively, to be smart, intelligent or numerate.  Even the most diligent individuals are left baffled by the byzantine private pension structures and the charging schedules that we have in this country.  When we dig beneath the surface, it is clear that Irish pension fees are completely out of kilter with the reality in our counterpart EU member states.  This is not a new problem.  For years, various Government and international reports have highlighted the problem of high charges and high management fees.  They have also noted a culture of concealment within the Irish pension market, something that this Bill aims to address.<\/p><p>That is what is at the heart of this Bill: transparency.  As far back as 2012 a report from the Minister&rsquo;s own Department noted that there are significant deficiencies and inconsistencies regarding pension transparency.  It too noted little evidence of a culture of providing clear information in a simple manner.  Nobody could have been surprised when they read the 2014 OECD report - an independent report from an internationally respected think-tank - on Ireland&rsquo;s pension fees which stated, &ldquo;<font color=\"#444444\">One of the most patent signs of a governance failure in [Ireland's] private pensions system is the high charges often observed<\/font>&rdquo;.  Where there are governance failures, it is up to a regulator to intervene.  Those are strong words: &ldquo;governance failure&rdquo;.  Where the regulator is not empowered to intervene, it is up to this Legislature to intervene and provide the legislation within which a regulator might work to represent the best interests of citizens and consumers.  The report to which I refer cited how Irish pensions were &ldquo;substantially above the charge levels observed in the best performing countries like Denmark or Sweden, where total management fees are below 0.5%&rdquo;.  It is not unusual in Ireland to see management fees of 2% to 3% or maybe more.  That is absolute scam being perpetrated on hard-working people.<\/p><p>In short, the evidence shows that not only are costs higher, but they are too often hidden from unsuspecting pension customers.  Indeed, the latter often allows the former to occur.  An interesting 86-page study was provided to me last year.  It further reiterated these points.  It gave us more objective evidence as to what is going on in the Irish pensions market and it provided some significant information.  This thorough document sets out how the impact of the charges, particularly annual management charge, can wipe out up to 60% of the final pension pot after a worker and their employer spent years putting it together.  The study takes the case of a 32-year-old woman who is earning &euro;50,000 per year, which is a modest and reasonable income, although these days one would wonder.  She will retire in 2057 at the age of 68.  The report shows that a pension product with 3% of an annual management charge and 3% contribution fee will create a pension pot of &euro;686,000.  The pension contributions by the individual and employer would have been &euro;418,000.  Fees going to the advisers will be an eye-watering &euro;300,000.  This is an astonishing figure.  If the pension fees were 1%, for example, which they should be, the pension pot available to the individual would be &euro;1 million, or an extra &euro;356,000 in total.<\/p><p>Although the total cost of fees can be argued over by the actuaries, nobody in this Chamber can credibly deny that transparency and high charges are not a real problem.  Indeed, this is a problem that the Minister has acknowledged, to be fair.  Her decision to call on the Pensions Authority to introduce a cost transparency initiative in response to the publication in April 2021 of this Labour Party Private Members' Bill was welcome.  From a recent reply to a parliamentary question, I understand that the report in question was recently completed.  If the details are available, I would welcome an outline of the recommendations in that report and an indication of when the Minister intends to make its findings public.<\/p><p>Such action will be necessary to restore confidence in this Government&rsquo;s capacity to effectively regulate and protect pension customers.  Indeed, such transparency with regard to charges is crucial in the context of the long-awaited introduction of auto-enrolment.  Thousands of workers currently without pensions need to know they can trust the fund with their hard-earned money.  With our pension pot already evaporating into thin air due to inflation and other factors, they will not welcome the idea of a future pension pot being further eroded by less than transparent fees.  As it stands, most ordinary pension customers are already paying extraordinary sums of money and excessive annual management charges, contribution fees and so on.  In real terms, their pension pot, which is a product of their endeavours in life, is being drastically eroded by up to one third in some cases, as I have explained previously.  Critically, this means - and it is something that will be of concern to the Minister for Social Protection - less money to pay the bills in old age, a lower quality of life and ultimately poorer health outcomes.  We know from research that those with smaller pension provision and with less of a pension to rely on have poorer health outcomes and that poor pension provision naturally leads to a shorter and less healthy life.  If this Bill is passed, however, it will be a first step in protecting the hard-earned pensions of citizens.  I am not overstating or making any excessive claims about what this legislation will do, but it certainly will help.  It will finally require pension trustees to provide clear and concise information about the number and amount of charges under the scheme in both cash and percentage terms.  Put simply, it would mean that pension customers will be able to see exactly how much they are being charged.  They will also see how this will have an impact on their final pension pot without having to decode the complicated small print.  In short, these changes will radically transform the information available to savers to enable savers to make informed decisions themselves.  It will ensure that they can reliably compare products in order get the best value for themselves in retirement.  The time to act on this now.  Not only is action required to protect current future pensioners who are doing their best to put away an adequate nest egg for retirement, but it is needed now.  It is also required, I hope the Minister will agree, to protect the public finances and to ensure that there will be less strain on the Social Insurance Fund into the future.<\/p> <p>Pension deductions by employees and employers totalled &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;2 billion, respectively, in 2019 alone.  This comes at a significant cost to the Exchequer as well, in terms of the of the generous - by international standards - pension reliefs that are available to encourage people to save for their retirement.  That is something that we do not always consider when we discuss pensions more generally.  It is essential that we ensure that the very significant reliefs provided to incentivise pension savings are no longer cannibalised by costly pension charges.  We also need to make sure that this multibillion euro pensions industry is finally made honest.<\/p> <p> We saw, a decade ago, how our unaccountable banking sector got too big for its boots and behaved recklessly as a result.  We are still living with the consequences.  This ultimately had a disastrous knock-on effect for people in the real economy - and consequences that are still evident today.  There are many good and professional people, such as brokers and others working in the system, all across what is a valuable industry for this country in terms of employment.  They do a very good job, and do their job professionally and ethically 99.9% of the time.  This legislation is about making sure that we have the kind of transparency that people who are saving so much for their retirement really need.  There is a real risk that a lack of transparency, trust and openness in our pension market may lead to similar mismanagement to that experienced in the banking sector with equal, if not greater, consequences for savers and the State.<\/p> <p> That is why, in addition to this transparency  in charges legislation, I think it is time that we had a full pension market review.  Similar to the recent banking review initiated by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, the review would bring together all relevant stakeholders and allow the public - because at the end of the day, this is about the public - to come together and have a real say on the future of the industry on the island and how it is going to work more effectively.  It is deeply disappointing that in response to a recent parliamentary question on the issue the Minister stated that she does not have any intention of holding such a review.  I ask her to keep an open perspective on that question.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for her time today and for coming in here herself to take this Bill, as the senior Minister in the Department.  We need full transparency in relation to charges, fees and pension funds.  It is interesting that the experience in Europe is very different from the experience here.  It is time to bring the stakeholders together to chart a course for the sector, one that has transparency, accountability and affordable fees at its heart. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200051#BBB00500","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663862700,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;That&quot; and substitute the following:  \t&quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the Pensions (Amendment) (Transparency in Charges) Bill 2021 be deemed to be read a second time this day nine months, to allow for, amongst other things, an examination and assessment of the issues pertaining to the provision of information to pension scheme members in relation to costs and charges incurred by pension schemes and, if deemed to be required, to identify and develop the appropriate policy responses and associated methodologies.&quot;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am happy to accept the amendment to the amendment tabled by my Labour Party colleagues and I am grateful for their consideration in this regard.  The nine-month timed amendment to the Bill will allow for consideration by my Department of the provision of charges-related information to pension scheme members and to report to the D&aacute;il.  I thank Deputy Nash for his work on preparing the Bill and providing the House with an opportunity to debate this matter.  I fully accept the spirit in which this Bill is being brought forward and I agree that improved pension costs transparency and better outcomes for pension savers are always desirable.  The availability of comprehensive and transparent information on costs and charges is important, and helps consumers to decide whether investments represent value for money.<\/p><p>Prior to commenting on the Bill itself, it is worthwhile to first note that the Government continues to progress several key initiatives, or has recently implemented policy measures, which will lead to considerably reduced administrative costs for pensions and improved costs transparency which I will now briefly set out.  For the purposes of transposing IORP Il requirements, regulations signed in April 2021 require trustees to draw up and provide scheme members with an annual pension benefit statement containing key information about the pension scheme.  Those regulations require that the statement contain information on pension projections and costs incurred by the scheme over the past 12 months, and provide that such information should be clear, succinct and comprehensive and avoid the use of jargon.  Given the recent introduction of these requirements, it would be more appropriate and prudent for a sufficient period of time to have elapsed prior to introducing or implementing additional requirements.  <\/p><p>The Roadmap for Pension Reform 2018-2023 highlighted the very large number of private pension schemes in Ireland, numbering approximately 160,000.  It also highlighted concerns regarding the professional fees charged to these schemes both for administration and investment advice, and the standard of governance of these schemes.  The roadmap sets out an approach to reforming the pensions market and rationalising these schemes, which will contribute to lower overall pension costs in the future.  Charges incurred by schemes should also be considered in the context of ongoing work to develop a master trust regime which will realise significant consolidation of pension schemes.  This will enhance scheme governance, achieve economies of scale and result in reduced administrative costs to schemes.  Research has shown that larger pension schemes incur lower pension costs, particularly across defined contribution pension schemes.  Deputy Nash will also be aware that I wrote to the Pension Council in March of last year requesting that it consider the issue of pension costs in Irish schemes, including issues with regard to the transparency of these costs.  Specifically, I asked the council to consider the merits of introducing a cost transparency Initiative, similar to that in the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands.  The council's report was recently completed and its recommendations are currently being considered by my officials.  That examination will require consultation with the Pensions Authority, as well as other Departments prior to determining the appropriate policy responses.  I hope Deputy Nash will appreciate that the introduction of new provisions into the Pensions Act, such as those proposed by the Bill, would be premature until that examination has been finalised, which is why we have suggested a timed amendment today.<\/p><p>In March of this year, the Government approved the final design principles for the automatic enrolment supplementary retirement savings system.  A general scheme for the legislation has recently been approved by the Government, and work in this regard is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is envisaged that the system will impose a charges cap on auto-enrolment providers.  It is essential that any information provided to scheme members is, as required by IORP Il, set out in a clear manner and presented in a way that is easy to read.  The complex nature of the proposed statement as set out in the Bill, while obviously introduced with best intentions, raises concern as to whether it can achieve the intended policy objective of providing such clarity and, as such, whether it would comply with IORP Il information-related requirements.  People are often reluctant to engage with pensions and the more detailed and complex the information, the less likely they are to engage with it.  In addition to these concerns, the statement proposed by the Bill will necessitate complicated calculations in such matters as benefit projections and anticipated reduction in yields.  Again, I fully appreciate the Deputy's intention here, but this measure would increase the administrative burden on schemes, as well as resulting in higher costs arising from the engagement of specialists such as actuaries to provide these calculations.  As we know, if a scheme becomes more costly to run, this will negatively impact on the pension payments ultimately payable to scheme members.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the provisions in the Bill.  The Bill, as drafted, applies to all pension schemes.  However, it would not be possible to apply most of the provisions to defined benefit schemes given that administrative costs are ordinarily borne by the sponsoring employer rather than the individual pension saver.  The Bill sets out detailed and complex provisions in relation to the matters that shall be specified in the proposed statement of the impact of charges.  This includes projected level of benefits, the number and amount of charges incurred in the next 12 months which must be expressed in three different ways, and the anticipated reduction in yield.  This is problematic as some charges may not be known 12 months in advance, and would depend on the contributions made and investment growth achieved.  In addition, previous research has highlighted that charges communicated in percentages appear difficult to understand.<\/p> <p>The Bill proposes that the statement should contain information on reduction in yield in percentage and cash terms.  Reduction in yield represents just one method of expressing total charges and it may not be the most appropriate in the context of the impact of charges on a pension scheme.  In any case, reduction in yield cannot, by definition, be expressed in cash terms.  <\/p> <p> The Bill also proposes that the statement shall be provided within seven days of any increase in the number or amounts of charges.  Any charges based on accumulated assets would result in the charges increasing when assets do.  Every such increase would automatically trigger an obligation to issue a statement resulting in a higher administrative burden and costs being incurred by schemes.  There are a number of other technical difficulties with this Bill which need further consideration and remedy as it progresses.  <\/p> <p> As I have already outlined, any new proposals must take account of the existing information-related requirements imposed on trustees, as well as the various policy initiatives currently under way.  This is to ensure that the proposals do not add greater complexity and duplication for pension savers and schemes.  I am of the view that the timed amendment will provide an opportunity to consider the approach to the information on charges in a holistic and integrated manner.  I again commend the Deputy for his work in preparing the Bill and am happy to engage with him in the months ahead as we look to progress measures to ensure pension schemes have greater transparency, which is certainly something on which we all agree.<\/p> <p> The Deputy mentioned lower paid workers who do not have pensions.  More than 700,000 working people in this country do not provide for a pension.  That is why I have introduced the auto-enrolment scheme, which means that one's employer will match every &euro;3 one saves, and the Government will top it up with a further &euro;1.  For every &euro;1 saved, there will be a pot of &euro;7 in total.  We are progressing that legislation.  It is my intention to move it on as quickly as we can and get it operational by January 2024.  That is the plan.  A good deal of work is being undertaken at the moment in that regard.  I thank the Deputy for bringing forward this Bill.  We all agree we need transparency for costs and charges in pensions.  There is no doubt but that it is difficult to understand.  We are happy to work with the Deputy on this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200052#CCC00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663863300,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I welcome this legislation and commend Deputy Nash and the Labour Party for bringing it forward.  It is a piece of legislation that Sinn F&eacute;in will support.  This Bill has a simple objective and it is something that should be done.  The Government should not be slow to intervene when it comes to retirement income and the protection of income after retirement.  We have seen that all too often in the past.  I am reminded of the defined benefit schemes which saw employers walking away and employees left high and dry.  There was a lack of protections around those defined benefit schemes and the Government did not intervene.<\/p>  <p>  As has been said more than once in this debate, pensions are a minefield.  That in itself puts an awful lot of people off a private pension.  Part of the problem is that people naturally ask themselves if a pension is worth it, how much money will they get at the end of it and what it is going to cost.  If the answers to those questions are not clear at the start, more and more people who could do so will choose not to establish a private pension.  That is a part of the problem when we look at the low level of coverage that exists.  There is an over-reliance on the State pension for people in retirement.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, when we speak in particular about private pensions, we must note that they are out of the reach of many workers in this State.  That is particularly true of people of my generation who are struggling with high rents and struggling to put together a deposit for a home.  Those costs mean it is difficult to put money aside for a pension.  However, in respect of occupational pensions, in particular, where employees pay into a pension, we need far greater clarity and transparency.<\/p>  <p>  Auto-enrolment is important to protect the pensions and incomes of workers on their retirement.  It is also why getting auto-enrolment right is so important.  We need to supplement people at their retirement and the State pension is not enough.  Like the generation before us, many people in the years ahead will not be in a position to pay off their mortgages before they retire.  With that in mind, the State pension will not be enough and a supplementary pension will be important.  In 2018, I put together the Sinn F&eacute;in submission for the Strawman consultation on auto-enrolment.  One of the key points we made at that time was the need for transparency around fees and charges.  That will be key in auto-enrolment.  It also needs to be embedded into the pension system across the board.  I welcome what the Minister has said about auto-enrolment.  We need that to be rolled out as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  On a wider note, we need greater transparency across the board.  There have been a number of references to statements, including annual statements, being issued to people and the need for clarity in information.  That is important.  I welcome the Minister's press release this week which contained a commitment to ensuring the Government will provide PRSI statements relating to the State pension.  That is very important because in many cases, people do not have the information.  In some cases, people reach or get close to the State pension age and do not have enough contributions.  By the time they realise that, it is too late.  It is important that people have clarity around auto-enrolment and all other pensions, including the State pension.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have raised with the Minister before, we should be moving to the digital era and developing an application for pensions.  I hope we will see that with auto-enrolment.  To encourage people to remain in that scheme, they need an application on their phones.  They need to be able to click in and see their pension pots growing.  That will hopefully keep them within the scheme, especially when they are going to have many other costs.  People will not always be able to find money easily to set aside.  I hope that a State pension application will be considered so people can see what they are getting when they pay their PRSI.  They can be notified through the application when they have made enough contributions to entitle them to something under the treatment benefit scheme.  All of that is helpful and would provide clarity and transparency for people who pay tax in this State and who should be rewarded for that.  In many cases, people do not understand because they are without the knowledge and do not have the information easily to hand in respect of what they are getting back for the PRSI they pay, which includes the State pension.  I hope that will be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Minister has agreed to work with Deputy Nash on this legislation.  I hope we will see movement on this issue and that the Government will not be slow to intervene when it comes to pensions across the board, not just in respect of the State pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200053#DDD00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1663863300,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I have listened to the contributions of Deputies Nash and Kerrane.  I again thank Deputy Nash for giving the House the opportunity to debate this important issue.  I know it is an issue in which the Deputy has a keen interest.<\/p>  <p>  I will reiterate some of the points I made earlier.  We all know that improved pension cost transparency and better outcomes for pension savers are always desirable.  It is a complex world when one starts to look at pensions.  If one goes to someone to get advice about pensions, one needs to be awake because there is a fair bit of information to take in.  The closer one gets to pension age, the more conscious one becomes of how important it is.  That is why I would encourage young people who are starting off to save a little and do so often to try to build up that pension pot.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of comprehensive and transparent information on costs and charges helps consumers to decide whether investments represent value for money.  As I said, since 2021 trustees are required to provide scheme members with an annual pension benefit statement containing key information about the pension scheme, including pension projections and a breakdown of the costs incurred over the past 12 months.<\/p> <p>As I said, the Government is progressing work on a number of key pension policy initiatives that will, among other things, improve the transparency of pension costs.  This work includes advancing reforms as set out in the roadmap for pensions reform, progressing recommendations set out in the interdepartmental pension and taxation reform group report, the introduction of an auto-enrolment retirement savings scheme, and the implementation of a master trust regime.  That will facilitate significant consolidation of pension schemes and the Pensions Council's report on cost transparency which, as I said, has been recently completed and is being looked at by my officials.  As outlined, it is essential that any new proposals are considered in an integrated manner, taking account of the existing information-related requirements imposed on trustees as well as the various pension policy initiatives under way.  This is to ensure that proposals do not add greater complexity and duplication for pension savers and schemes.  The timed amendment will provide an opportunity to examine and consider the approach to the provision of charges related to information to pension scheme members.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies Nash and Kerrane for their contributions.  Their Bill was well timed as this is a week when there is a big focus on pensions.  It is also good that people realise they need to read the smaller print to make sure they are getting the information they need to make informed decisions.  At the end of the day, everybody has to make their own decision but they need to make sure they have all the information that enables them to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200053#DDD00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663863900,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1: <\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;To delete all words after &quot;deemed to be read a second time this day nine months, to allow for&quot; and substitute the following:   \t&quot;an examination, assessment and report to the D&aacute;il by the Minister within that period on the issues pertaining to the provision of information to pension scheme members in relation to costs and charges incurred by pension schemes and identifying and developing the appropriate policy responses and associated methodologies.&quot;  <\/blockquote>  <p>People's eyes glaze over when we talk about pensions, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200054#EEE00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1663863900,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Not ours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092200054#EEE00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1663863900,"counter":449,"content":"<p>That is not reflected in the attendance or contributions this evening, notwithstanding Deputy Kerrane's presence.
