One quarter of the &euro;20 million humanitarian package has been allocated to the UNHCR Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for neighbouring countries hosting Ukrainian refugees,\u00a0 22% of which is earmarked for Moldova.\u00a0 The total RRP to date is over &euro;1.7 billion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a dedicated &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding supports UNHCR&rsquo;s work specifically in Moldova. Irish Aid has also provided &euro;1.5 million to UNFPA, whose work in Moldova focuses on the protection of women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  Many of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian partners are expanding their activities to support the Moldovan government&rsquo;s response to the crisis. Last week, I announced that &euro;500,000 will be awarded to Plan International as part of Irish Aid&rsquo;s Civil Society Fund for Ukraine, which includes support to Moldova. Irish Aid has also granted &euro;1 million to the International Federation of the Red Cross, which works through the Moldovan Red Cross.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland provides humanitarian assistance through trusted humanitarian agencies to deliver aid quickly. This is done in coordination with central and local governments. We encourage our long-standing UN partners to also use prepositioned funding from Ireland to respond to the situation in Ukraine and neighbouring countries like Moldova.<\/p>  <p>  Together the EU and its Member States have provided nearly a combined &euro;1 billion in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established as the first permanent international court to end impunity for the perpetrators of international crimes. The Court was established in 2002 with the entry into force of the Rome Statute.\u00a0 By its very existence the Court not only promotes and upholds the rule of law but also provides a means of bringing to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. In this way it contributes in a fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been, and continues to be, a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC. We will continue to publicly support and promote the Court in all relevant international fora, including throughout the remainder of our term on the United Nations Security Council. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to political support for the Court, Ireland strongly believes that the ICC should have sufficient resources to deliver upon its unique and important mandate. The ICC is funded mainly by means of annual assessed contributions made by the States Parties to the Rome Statute, determined every year at the Assembly of States Parties.\u00a0 The total annual budget of the Court for 2022 is just under &euro;155 million, of which Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contribution is approximately &euro;1.2 million.\u00a0 Ireland has consistently promoted a budget for the Court that is sufficient to meet the many demands placed upon it, and the recently commenced investigation into the situation in Ukraine will considerably increase those demands over coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the Court&rsquo;s work is also supported by voluntary trust funds established for specific purposes.\u00a0 These include the Trust Fund for Least Developed Countries, the Trust Fund for Victims and the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Advanced Technology and Specialized Capacity.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 April, during my trip to Kyiv and Bucha in Ukraine, I announced that Ireland will make a voluntary contribution of &euro;3 million to the ICC, with &euro;1 million to be distributed immediately to the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Trust Fund. This funding will benefit the Prosecutor&rsquo;s work in all situation countries, not just Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland further believes that supporting victims is a critical part of implementing the Rome Statute and ensuring accountability. The ICC&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Victims was established to respond to the harm resulting from the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court. Ireland will provide a voluntary contribution of &euro;200,000 to the Trust Fund for Victims in 2022, to be split equally between its reparations and assistance mandates. This brings the total contribution of Ireland to the Trust Fund for Victims to over &euro;1.7 million since 2004.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, mindful that the ICC is the world&rsquo;s first permanent international criminal court, participation by all States is necessary to achieve the universality of the Rome Statute. Ireland has provided a voluntary contribution of &euro;10,000 to the Trust Fund for Least Developed Countries for 2022. This trust fund provides financial assistance to enable delegates from the least developed countries and other developing states to attend the annual session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[22976\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the current timeline for first-time passport applicants.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[22978\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will consider removing the fees for passport applications that are not completed until after the estimated delivery date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[22972\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his ongoing work at reducing wait times for passport applications; the reason for the delays in updating the online passport tracking system; the reason that members of the public cannot contact the Passport Office given that phone lines are frequently down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 118 and 148 together.<\/p>  <p>Since March of this year, the Passport Service has reduced the processing time for first time applications from 40 working days to 30 working days. This 25% reduction in processing times is as a direct result of the unprecedented level of investment that my Department has made in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over 400,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to a total of 634,000 passports issued in 2021. 117,000 passports were issued in April alone with 45% of adult renewal passports being issued within one to two working days.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  First time passport applications do take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications are currently taking 30 working days to process.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of staffing, the Department has been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive over the past several months. Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.<\/p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times in 2022, particularly for first time applicants. The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service including working targeted overtime to focus on key areas such as first time applications, intensive training of staff and enhanced public information resources.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to further reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the online Passport Tracker, this tool provides applicants with an indication of how their application is progressing through the system and gives an estimated issue date based on the current average application processing time. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The date displayed on the tracker is an estimate, and is based on the current average processing time for that type of application. For a small number of applications currently in the Passport Service system, the issue by date displayed on the tracker differs from the issue by date on the Passport Service internal processing system by one to three days.\u00a0The Passport Service regrets any inconvenience caused to applicants who have been affected. The cause of this issue has been identified by the Passport Service and they are working to rectify it.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0Customer Service\u00a0Hub officers respond to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as with enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. The\u00a0Customer Service\u00a0Hub handled over 175,000 enquiries in 2021 and is currently handling over 5,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the volumes of enquiries. The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is\u00a0green. I am confident that the recruitment of additional staff, along with significant training initiatives, will have a positive impact on our response to\u00a0customer service\u00a0demand.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Gannon's question in relation to refund of fees for passports that are not issued within the usual turnaround times, the vast majority of fully complete and correct applications are issued within turnaround times.\u00a0 A delay may, for example, be incurred for reasons such as the Passport Service attempting to contact a witness on multiple occasions rather than requesting the applicant to complete a new identity and consent form. \u00a0 Therefore such a measure would be very challenging to implement when the complexities with some applications is taken into consideration.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[22919\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000062#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the situation in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland was designed and agreed by the UK and EU to mitigate against the inevitable disruptions arising from Brexit on the island of Ireland and to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. <\/p>  <p>  EU-UK engagement on resolving outstanding issues under the Protocol is an ongoing process.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than county or country of residence of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.\u00a0Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius, Lesotho, Colombia, Panama, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in \"Passport Express\" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and Passport Express very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed 4,774 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan and the third in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed. Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour and the system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The Cork office can facilitate the issuance on the spot of an emergency passport where there is an urgent need to travel for medical reasons or due to a bereavement abroad.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options and the printing capacity of production equipment\u00a0meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000063#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000063#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[23174\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000063#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the support that is being made available by Ireland directly to support the ongoing efforts to shelter and provide for Ukrainians driven from their homeland by the aggression of the military forces of President Putin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>I remain extremely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to prepositioned funds with UN and other partners, my Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has made over &euro;20 million available to respond to the needs of Ukrainians most affected by the Russian invasion.\u00a0 This includes funding through UN agencies including UN OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO, as well as the Red Cross Movement.\u00a0 This includes support to refugees in Poland and Moldova, as well as those internally displaced and has enabled immediate assistance to be delivered to Ukrainians in need.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting Irish NGOs working in partnership with local civil society in Ukraine and its neighbours are being supported through a dedicated civil society fund.\u00a0 Ireland has provided In-kind assistance of medical supplies in response to a request by the Ukrainian government. <\/p>  <p>  Taken together, these Irish Aid interventions are enabling partners efforts to support over 3.5 million Ukrainian people in need, with our focus on the priorities for assistance identified by the UN.\u00a0 These include cash, education, food security, health, protection for women and children, shelter and sanitation.\u00a0 For example, Irish Aid assistance is enabling UNHCR to maintain 145 temporary reception centres.\u00a0 To date, more than 66,000 children have been engaged in formal or non-formal education provided by UNICEF.

Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can deliver peace, in line with international humanitarian law as well as international human rights norms and standards, and which respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.<\/p>  <p>  I witnessed with my own eyes the shocking aftermath of the devastation in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. I expressed to the Mayor of Bucha the sincere condolences of the Irish Government and people. I committed to bearing witness to these terrible atrocities and to raising the situation internationally. Those who perpetrated these heinous crimes must be brought to justice.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 April, as I promised to the mayor of Bucha and Foreign Minister Kuleba, I briefed the UN Security Council on my visit to Ukraine. I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued. 503 civilians had been identified at that stage - and just 4 soldiers. At the UN Security Council, I was clear that these facts speak to an utter disregard by Russian forces for their clear and unambiguous obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians. Ireland will continue to use our membership on the UN Security Council to hold Russia accountable for its actions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is one of over 40 countries that referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is providing a further &euro;3 million to the ICC.

Three big Russian state-owned broadcasters responsible for Russian state propaganda will be sanctioned, and will be unable to distribute their content in any form in the EU or attract advertising.\u00a0 The package also targets services, including accountancy, public relations and consultancy services to Russian companies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A complete import ban on all Russian oil is also proposed, to be introduced in an orderly fashion, it is hoped agreement can be reached soon to ensure that EU Member States can secure alternative supplies. Crude oil will be phased out within six months, and refined products such as petrol and diesel by the end of the year. There are also provisions to prevent Russia from diversifying its client base for oil products, including a ban on the provision of insurance and financing for the shipping of Russian oil.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has allocated &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, via the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN agencies. Additionally, at EU level, Ireland has contributed &euro;11.5m to an EU humanitarian assistance package of &euro;550m.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is providing a &euro;1.5 billion package of European Peace Facility (EPF) support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\u00a0 Ireland is contributing its full share (&euro;33 million), which will go towards non-lethal elements only.<\/p>  <p>  As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU Membership.

Accordingly, we remain very concerned about ongoing challenges relating to adherence to rule of law standards in Hungary. The EU has engaged a multifaceted response to challenges to the rule of law within the EU and its Member States. This includes the Article 7 Treaty on European Union (TEU) procedure, the Commission&rsquo;s Annual Rule of Law Report and related peer review process at the General Affairs Council, the Regulation on a General Regime of Conditionality for the Protection of the Union Budget or the so-called conditionality mechanism, and the use of infringement procedures. Ireland supports this multifaceted approach and actions taken under these procedures and mechanisms by the Commission in exercising its role as guardian of the treaties and ensuring all Member States uphold the EU&rsquo;s values and standards as well as their obligations under the Treaties.<\/p>  <p>  The Article 7 TEU procedure, whereby the European Council can determine whether there is a clear risk or existence of a breach of EU values by a Member State, was launched in relation to Hungary in 2018. Since this procedure&rsquo;s initiation, Ireland has participated actively in the hearings held to date at the General Affairs Council where we have urged Hungary to address its rule of law difficulties. Ireland will continue this participation, including at the next hearing on Hungary at the General Affairs Council on 23 May 2022, and values the opportunity for peer dialogue this procedure provides. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the Regulation on a General Regime of Conditionality for the Protection of the Union Budget is fair and serves an important purpose. Rule of law challenges risk endangering the appropriate use of EU financial resources. We hoped Hungary would have engaged constructively with the rule of law issues which the Commission identified in its informal correspondence with the Hungary government in late 2021 under the conditionality mechanism. We support the Commission&rsquo;s subsequent activation of the regulation in respect of Hungary in April 2022 given Hungary&rsquo;s lack of sufficient clarification and commitment to action. Ireland urges Hungary to engage productively with this conditionality regulation procedure and to undertake the necessary reforms to address rule of law problems.

This 25% reduction in processing times is as a direct result of the unprecedented level of investment that my Department has made in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.\u00a0<\/p><p>Over 400,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to a total of 634,000 passports issued in 2021. 117,000 passports were issued in April alone with 45% of adult renewal passports being issued within one to two working days.\u00a0<\/p><p>There are currently 183,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.<\/p><p>Passport Service figures show that of the total number of passport applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. Applications that are incomplete cannot be processed within the average turnaround times.<\/p><p>The vast majority of applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>- 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service\u00a0<\/p><p>In relation to applications from county Cork, as with applications from all citizens, these are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork, on the basis of the type of application rather than county of residence of the applicant. Passport application turnaround times are the same for all citizens regardless of county of residence. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services:<\/p><p>- The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.<\/p><p>- A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021. <\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.<\/p><p>- The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.\u00a0<\/p><p>- In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week.\u00a0<\/p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.<\/p><p>- There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.\u00a0<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p><p>The numbers of passport applications currently in the Passport Service system from counties Cork, Kerry, Kildare and Wicklow are outlined below in tabular form.<\/p><p>The table outlines the total number of applications in the system by county as well as the number that are currently being processed by the Passport Service and the number of applications that require further action from the applicant, such as the submission of additional documentation. <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>Total Applications in System<\/th>       <th>Passport Service Processing<\/th>       <th>Further action required by applicant<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>9,053<\/td>       <td>5,360<\/td>       <td>3,693<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>2,128<\/td>       <td>1,284<\/td>       <td>844<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>4,343<\/td>       <td>2,603<\/td>       <td>1,740<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>2,680<\/td>       <td>1,556<\/td>       <td>1,124<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000064#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000064#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[22995\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000064#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent of the backlog in foreign birth registrations; and the steps that he is taking to address the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.<\/p>  <p>  The resourcing of the Passport Service to respond to current demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration is a priority for my Department, which has been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive.

Together, these are the most extensive sanctions in the history of the EU. The aim of these sanctions is to deprive the Russian government, and the supporters and enablers of this war, of the means to continue their illegal aggression against Ukraine.\u00a0<\/p><p>The sanctions are composed of both sectoral measures, which target specific economic sectors, industries or broad areas (such as the media), and of individual measures, which apply to named people and entities.<\/p><p>The sectoral sanctions  target the Russian financial, energy, technology and defence, and transport sectors. Similar sanctions have also been introduced on Belarus, in view of the support that it has given to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Restrictive measures on trade with the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Ukraine have been introduced. Restrictions have also been put in place on the broadcasting of certain Russia state-owned media platforms in the EU, to limit the spread of disinformation.<\/p><p>The financial sanctions on Russia are particularly wide-ranging, affecting most of the Russian banking system, as well as key State-owned companies. Among other things, they ban transactions with the Central Bank of Russia, restrict Russian access to the EU&rsquo;s capital and financial markets, and exclude key Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system.<\/p><p>The sixth sanctions package is expected to include additional listings of individuals, such as high-ranking Russian military officers responsible for atrocities in Bucha and the siege of Mariupol. Additional entities in the Russian defence sector are also expected to be sanctioned, bringing the total number of entities sanctioned to close to 100. On the financial side, three more Russian banks, including Sberbank, are to be removed from the SWIFT financial messaging system. The sale and transfer of EU property to residents of Russia it to be prohibited, as will the provision of audit and accountancy services, tax and other consultancy services and public relations services to Russian companies. Export controls are to be further strengthened. An additional three major Russian State-owned broadcasters will also be sanctioned.\u00a0<\/p><p>Significantly, it is planned to ban the import of Russian oil to the EU, with a phasing-out period to ensure that Member States can secure alternative supplies. This follows the ban on imports of Russian coal to the EU, as introduced in the fifth sanctions package, which will be effective from August.\u00a0<\/p><p>General principles guiding the adoption of EU sanctions are that they must be sustainable for Member States to implement, and that they should cause more damage to the sanctioned parties than to the EU. All proposals for new EU sanctions concerning Russia and Belarus are prepared in close coordination with partner countries, such as the US and the UK, to ensure that they will have maximal impact.<\/p><p>To date, Ireland has supported the widest possible sanctions, and has expressed openness to additional tough measures, including a possible future ban on the import of Russian gas. EU Member States will continue to consider further sanctions until a ceasefire in Ukraine can be agreed and the Russian invasion is deemed to have ended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000064#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":146,"content":"<p>Question No. 131 answered with Question No. 123.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Union","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000064#WRD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[23176\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000064#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the financial support in new money terms being made available directly to Moldova, Poland and Romania by the European Union to support their ongoing efforts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>On 5 April, the European Council authorised the disbursement of &euro;150 million in loans and grants to Moldova in the coming months to support its financial stability and substantive reform agenda.<\/p><p>Also on 5 April, Germany, France, and Romania hosted EU Member States, including Ireland, as well as other international partners at the Moldova Support Conference &ldquo;Bridge of Solidarity&rdquo;, which raised &euro;659.5 million in grants and loans.

At the most recent meeting of the Council on the Middle East on 25 April, Ireland expressed our particular concern at the recent escalation in tensions in East Jerusalem.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, Ireland&rsquo;s priority is to try to find a way to change the reality on the ground. Ireland will use the recommendations and conclusions of the Amnesty International report to influence the approach that we take towards trying to protect and encourage a peace process that can deliver a two-state solution, which is the Government's priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000065#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":177,"content":"<p>Question No. 147 answered with Question No. 123.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":178,"content":"<p>Question No. 148 answered with Question No. 98.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000065#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[22998\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000065#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on substantial reform of the United Nations Security Council and Ireland's position on the reform process beyond the procedural reforms regarding the veto which took place in April 2022; if Ireland is part of United Nations Assembly and other calls for United Nations Security Council reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>Discussions on reform of the Security Council take place in the General Assembly, through the ongoing Intergovernmental Negotiations framework for Security Council reform. \u00a0<\/p><p>Ireland has long been active in these negotiations and has been consistently clear on the need to increase the size of the Security Council; to address geographic under-representation, particularly for Africa; and to see an end to the use of the veto, particularly in cases of mass atrocity crimes. \u00a0<\/p><p>There are significant challenges in securing progress but we continue to push for change.<\/p><p>One important element of change that Ireland, and like-minded partners, managed to deliver recently was to give the General Assembly a role when the veto is used by a permanent member of the Security Council.

These Regulations do not apply in certain circumstances such as buying from another consumer, buying from a business outside the EU or when certain goods or services are purchased.<\/p>  <p>  The information requirements facilitate the consumer making an informed decision before a purchase is made or a contract is entered into and removes any surprises such as hidden charges. \u00a0It is in the interests of the consumer that they read this information before agreeing to make a purchase.\u00a0 The information requirements should be in clear and simple language and include:<\/p>  <p>  - the main characteristics of the purchase<\/p>  <p>  - the contract duration (if applicable)<\/p>  <p>  - the total cost and any additional charges that are to be paid<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide protections after goods are purchased or a service signed up to online, such as a statutory right to cancel (called a cooling-off period), timeframes for delivery if none have been agreed and timeframes for refunds from a business when the right to cancel has been exercised.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide 14 days for a consumer to change their mind about a purchase (with some exceptions).\u00a0 For goods bought, the 14 days begins on the day they are received and for a service, it begins on the day the contract is concluded.\u00a0 If the business does not inform the consumer of their right to cancel, the cooling-off period can be extended to a maximum of 12 months.\u00a0 After the business is notified of a cancellation, the consumer has a further 14 days to return the goods to them.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Delivery times depend on what was agreed at time of purchase, e.g., if a website says delivery will be within 3-5 days, then that is what has been agreed. However, if no delivery timeframe is agreed, then the Regulations state that delivery must be within 30 days. If delivery does not happen within the timeframe agreed, the consumer can either agree a different date or can cancel the contract and get a refund.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide that a business must refund the consumer without undue delay and not later than 14 days after the order is cancelled, where it is cancelled within the cooling-off period. \u00a0A business can hold on to the refund until it has proof that the consumer has sent the goods back.<\/p>  <p>  Enforcement of these Regulations falls within the remit of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Users of the Internet can sometimes fall victim to or encounter an online scam in which attackers attempt to obtain personal information such as logon profiles or banking details or where they are tricked into paying for something that the person has no right to sell or provide.

It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To coordinate the provision of EV supports and grants and the delivery of charging infrastructure, the Government will establish an office of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) within the Department of Transport in Summer 2022.\u00a0ZEVI will coordinate and support the development and roll-out of publicly accessible charging infrastructure.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.\u00a0\u00a0In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. <\/p>  <p>In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30th   of June 2022. To date over &euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured\u00a0&euro;25m\u00a0of funding to provide\u00a0for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will\u00a0allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the YAC will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. \u00a0This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.\u00a0\u00a0The National Transport Authority (NTA) is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented<\/p>  <p>As the Deputies will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living.  This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th\u00a0of April and it is intended to roll-out the next stage of the reductions on GDA services from the 9th \u00a0of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year. The Government decision did not include broadening this initiative to include commercial bus operators.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the increased patronage on public service obligation bus and train services since the price reduction of 20% in fares was introduced, this would also be a matter for the NTA who are responsible for the collection and publication of statistics relating to public transport.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the above,\u00a0 I have forwarded the Deputies specific questions to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply.

Such measures will provide better access to a range of amenities, employment opportunities and to onward public transport connections to larger centres.<\/p>  <p>  A Community Transport Fund is also being established to support occasional social travel requests. This will be operated by the TFI Local Link offices and will enable our Ukrainian guests to join in the many activities that are available in our towns, in particular, activities focused on youth, integration, culture, and education.<\/p>  <p>  Transport is central to the response efforts by Ireland and collectively, these endeavours aim to support the integration of our Ukrainian guests into the local communities that are hosting them. We will keep the issue of transport provision under review as this situation continues to evolve.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibilities for the procurement and operation of public transport services in rural areas, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you regarding the details of which bus services have been introduced to date.

As is the case with all VAT exempt activities, this means that they are not required to charge VAT on their supply of the relevant services, nor are they entitled to reclaim VAT on their purchases used for the services. \u00a0This is a fundamental feature of the VAT regime at EU and national level.<\/p>  <p>  However, alongside the VAT system, there is a grants scheme under which bodies (including schools) which are qualifying charities may qualify for a grant in recognition of the VAT they have incurred.\u00a0 The VAT Compensation Scheme was introduced in recent years to reduce the tax burden on Charities by partially compensating them for the VAT incurred in delivering on their charitable purpose. Under the scheme,\u00a0charities may apply for a grant related to a proportion of their VAT costs, based on their level of funding other than from public and certain other sources. In order to be a qualifying charity for the scheme, a school would need to be registered with the Revenue Commissioners and hold a charitable tax exemption under section 207 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and be registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority. It&rsquo;s qualifying income would exclude income from public sources and educational fees. A total annual capped fund of &euro;5m is available under the Scheme. Where the total amount of eligible applications from all Charities in a year exceeds the capped amount, grants are paid on a pro rata basis. Detailed information regarding the VAT Compensation Scheme for Charities is available on the Revenue Commissioners website at the following link: www.revenue.ie\/en\/companies-and-charities\/charities-and-sports-bodies\/vat-compensation-scheme\/vat-compensation-scheme-for-charities\/index.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that the information required to estimate the cost of the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to allow all schools to reclaim VAT is not readily available as Revenue do not have data about their purchases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000070#WRK05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[22597\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000070#WRK05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the preparation work that has been carried out to enable a new vacant property tax to be introduced in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":502,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a Vacant Property Tax.

The policy was introduced to counteract disinflationary pressures and to stimulate spending and investment in the wake of the global financial and sovereign debt crises. The Deposit Facility Rate (DFR) has been -0.5% since September 2019.

The most recent Action Plan implementation report, published in March 2022, shows that some 80 per cent of actions are now being delivered, with the remainder initiated. Given the increasing priority and pace of reform under the Action Plan, it is necessary for the insurance industry to pass on benefits to customers.<\/p>  <p>  Both Minister of State Fleming and I have been clear on these points and have been holding the insurance sector to account on commitments made.\u00a0 In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has met individually with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market twice\u00a0since the adoption of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. In these meetings, and in ongoing engagement with industry, Minister of State Fleming has consistently stressed the importance of insurers reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums, and the need for insurers to respect the Guidelines by not settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them.<\/p>  <p>  These engagements have been positive, with insurers confirming their commitment to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and that they are adhering to them in their direct settlements. During these meetings, Minister of State Fleming emphasised to insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan is still ongoing and it may take some time for the benefits of the reforms, such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines, to feed through to reduced premiums and greater availability of insurance for businesses and other groups. Minister of State Fleming and I are continuing to work with colleagues to implement the remaining actions as a matter of priority.

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services.<\/p>  <p>  The USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of his\/her own individual income and personal circumstances.\u00a0The USC is applied at a low rate on a wide base, which ensures that it is a stable and sustainable source of revenue for the State. Currently individuals with incomes of less than &euro;13,000 are exempt from USC.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, joint Department of Finance\/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research found that USC represented a more stable form of revenue than income tax. The findings highlighted that USC revenues would fluctuate by less than income tax revenues whenever income is volatile, for example where the economy moves from a boom into a bust. Given the openness of the Irish economy and consequent susceptibility to economic shocks, the contribution that the USC makes to the stability of the State&rsquo;s revenue sources is considerable.<\/p>  <p>  The USC has played a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.\u00a0 USC receipts have been central to the current stability of the public finances since March 2020, despite the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Receipts from the USC in 2021 amounted to &euro;4.4 billion &ndash; 16.5% of total income tax receipts or 6.4% of total Exchequer receipts. The projected USC yield for 2022 is broadly similar. If USC were to be abolished, it would be necessary to raise approximately &euro;4.4 billion from other sources.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI.

In practice, this means that equality budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  Equality objectives and indicators are published every year in the REV\u00a0and the Public Service Performance Report.\u00a0 The initial focus of Equality Budgeting was on gender, following which the initiative was extended to other dimensions of equality\u00a0including disability and socioeconomic inequality.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the OECD published a report on Equality Budgeting in Ireland, providing 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. Implementation of the report's recommendations is now at an advanced stage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with the OECD recommendation to develop an equalities data strategy, the CSO completed a data audit in cooperation with my Department, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. A report on this audit was published in October 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support the continuing development of performance budgeting in Ireland, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has been successful in its application to the EU&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP). The project that the EU is funding under this Programme is providing Ireland with the opportunity to work with technical experts from the EU and OECD as well as other international experts in order to take stock of how effectively performance budgeting has been working and to consider future directions for ongoing reform drawing on international best practice. This project also takes cognisance of the other reform initiatives (e.g., equality budgeting, green budgeting, and well-being budgeting).<\/p>  <p>  An inter-departmental group has also been established for Equality Budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government departments. This group plays a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, the Government set out a commitment to developing a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring.\u00a0 In terms of setting out an overall well-being framework, in July 2021, the Government published the First Report on a Well-being Framework for Ireland.\u00a0 The Report sets out an overarching vision of the Well-being Framework: enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  As noted in the Expenditure Report 2022, the next phase of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform's work in this area is to develop an approach for associating public expenditure with the various dimensions of the Well-being Framework.\u00a0 The intention is to develop over time a way of setting out budgetary decisions on the basis of well-being dimensions; an approach that would complement the existing Vote Group approach to presenting such decisions.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000072#WRM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000072#WRM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[23102\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000072#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of full-time qualified roofers and tilers employed by the OPW as of 1 January 2021 and 1 May 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>The OPW have no full-time qualified roofers and tilers employed nor are they sanctioned posts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000072#WRM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000072#WRM03300"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[23200\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000072#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide details of contracts awarded in 2022 by his Department or bodies under his aegis outside the standard procurement process in order to assist the arrival of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine;

Horizontal supports such as the EWSS and the CRSS have been instrumental in helping businesses across the economy to retain employees and cover costs. In the sectors I oversee, dedicated supports have complemented the horizontal measures and have reflected the particular challenges faced by these sectors. <\/p><p>The Government's careful management of the pandemic over the past two years has meant that we were able to remove all restrictions on the economy and society earlier this year. Notwithstanding this, in recognition of the particular challenges faced by the sectors I oversee, a number of dedicated supports have been maintained or introduced this year to assist the recovery in those sectors worst affected, for example:<\/p><p>In\u00a0<b>Tourism<\/b>, I secured an additional &euro;50 million for the Tourism Business Continuity Schemes for 2022. These schemes are managed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and will support businesses across the tourism sectors that need it most urgently, taking account of the Government funding that has already been received and the wider context of the horizontal supports provided by Government.\u00a0To date under the 2022 Tourism Business Continuity Schemes, 367 payments have been made amounting to &euro;21.7 million with a further 429 applications being evaluated. All schemes are expected to be completed by the end of June 2022.<\/p><p>A number of schemes have also been made available to support the recovery in the <b>Arts and Culture<\/b>sector this year. <\/p><p>- The &euro;15m Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme (LPRGS) is a new grant for businesses engaged in staging live events in the arts and culture live performance sector. The scheme, which opened in March 2022, aims to de-risk the planning of events across spring and summer of 2022 and to assist with the costs of reopening.\u00a0<\/p><p>- The Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme 2022 (CECGS 2022) has a funding allocation of &euro;5 million to support the commercial arts sector. Grants will be paid to successful applicants as a contribution to the capital costs associated with reopening after closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>- The pilot Basic Income Scheme for the Arts has recently opened. This scheme will examine, over a 3 year period, the impact of a basic income on artists and creative arts workers. Payments of &euro;325 per week will be made to 2,000 eligible artists and creative arts workers who will be selected at random and invited to take part. <\/p><p>- In December 2021, I launched the Live Performance Support Scheme 3 (LPSS3) to support events planned for December and January. <\/p><p>- An additional &euro;5m of funding was allocated to local authorities for the 2022 Local Live Performance Support Scheme (LLPSS). The aim of the scheme is to help underpin the recovery of the live performance sector at a local level.<\/p><p>- As part of the &euro;50m in supports for 2022 for the Live Entertainment sector, &euro;4m was allocated to the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) in 2022. These MEBAS 2022 grants will be paid for six months, January 2022 to June 2022, similar to the supports being offered under broader Live Entertainment LPSS supports.\u00a0<\/p><p>In December 2021, almost &euro;80m was allocated for the <b>Sport <\/b>sector under two separate support programmes. Of this, &euro;73.6m funding is being provided under five separate streams to help sports organisations to recover and grow post-pandemic, support our grassroots networks of clubs and local sports partnerships, and ensure that people of all ages and abilities return to sport and physical activity.\u00a0 The timing of the schemes provides stability and certainty to the sports sector for 2022 as it emerges from Covid-19 restrictions. In addition,\u00a0&euro;5.3m was allocated to National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) and Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) for the provision of sports equipment including the roll out of defibrillators for clubs, sport kits for school children and state of the art equipment for high performance athletes. This significant investment built on the extensive support package of &euro;88.5m provided in 2020 to address the COVID-19 challenges to the sport sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>Insofar as <b>Gaeltacht<\/b>regions are concerned, my Department recently initiated three specific measures in further support of the Irish summer colleges sector, post COVID-19. Key measures include increased funding under the Departments&rsquo;s Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge - \u00a0payable to qualifying Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to students attending accredited Gaeltacht summer colleges, in addition to an increased allocation of 350 scholarships (over the 2019 allocation) to support students of DEIS post-primary schools in availing of Gaeltacht summer college courses. The overall additional funding of c. &euro;800,000 being provided in relation to these measures inter alia represents the largest increase in investment in support of the Irish summer colleges sector in a single year since the scheme was first introduced in 1972.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>In recognition of COVID-19 impacts on the <b>Broadcasting<\/b>sector, I secured additional funding for the Sound and Vision scheme which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

Progress on the delivery of its objectives to date has included the roll-out of a number of schools-based initiatives allowing culture, creativity and the arts flourish in the education system. <\/p>  <p>  Creative Schools, delivered by the Arts Council, has supported 652 schools develop and implement their own creative plan, while strengthening the relationships between schools and the broader cultural and community infrastructure. Creative Clusters, delivered by my colleague Minister Foley, enables groups of up to five schools to collaborate on an innovative arts and creative project to address a common issue or challenge (almost 300 schools to date). In 2021, Minister Foley announced a new initiative developed by the Department of Education, titled BLAST (Bringing Live Arts to Schools and Teachers), which enabled over 480 new Arts-in-Education residencies in schools in its first year. Creative Youth also provides funding support for Creative Engagement grants operated by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Creative Youth has seen my department form partnerships to further enrich creative and cultural engagement in schools. Collaborating with Sing Ireland, the YouthSing Ireland programme developed high quality interactions with musicians, online performance activities and educational resources for young people. This included a specific set of songs and resources in Irish or of Irish cultural heritage designed for use in formal and informal settings. The Big Idea, in partnership with the Institute of Designers in Ireland, works with students to address problems and issues through creative problem solving and design thinking.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department provides ongoing financial support for a number of initiatives which support language learning and enrichment opportunities in Gaeltacht schools via the traditional arts and sports. This further underpins the ongoing implementation of the language planning process and the policy on Gaeltacht education as key drivers of government&rsquo;s overarching 5-Year Action Plan for the Irish language (Plean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022). <\/p>  <p>  Under my Department&rsquo;s Community and Language Support Programme, funding is provided to support Gaeltacht-based organisations to deliver agreed work programmes in the domains of the traditional arts (Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta) and sports (Cl&aacute;r na gCluich&iacute; Gaelacha). Both of these programmes are largely delivered through the network of schools in Gaeltacht regions.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department continues to support the initiatives referenced above in a collaborative manner across Government, primary responsibility for Irish culture as part of the school curriculum rests with my colleague, Minister Foley.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000073#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Facilities","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000073#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[22806\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000073#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if consideration will be given to an integration plan between sporting venues and transport infrastructure here in order to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to host international sporting events; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>Major International Sport Events typically involve close liaison with other relevant actors including transport providers.

With Housing First, the priority is to support a person who has experienced homelessness into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around addiction or mental health treatment. Then, intensive work continues on these issues once they are housed. Housing First has been a key element of Government homelessness policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing First approach to addressing homelessness places direct access to housing first and foremost for vulnerable individuals using homeless services consistently or intermittently over long periods of time, and those unable or resistant to accessing homeless services and who may then become habitual rough sleepers. These individuals often have complex high support needs such as mental or physical health problems, addiction issues or dual diagnosis (the presence of mental ill health and a substance addiction).<\/p>  <p>  Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies. Housing First service providers assess rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation for suitability for Housing First and if they meet the criteria they are supported to access Housing First units. These criteria are further outlined in the Housing First Manual for Ireland, which was written by Dr Sam Tsemberis, the originator of the Housing First concept.

Tenants have been selected by AHBs for a further 4 Cost Rental schemes due for delivery in the coming months, with further developments due later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  Affordable purchase homes supported by the AHF, will be made available in Boherboy, Cork City this May, with indicated prices of &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling.

The scheme will be jointly established and governed with participating mortgage lenders (primarily pillar retail banks). The overall anticipated spending for the scheme is &euro;400m, funded on a 50:50 basis by the State and participating mortgage lenders. The current schedule anticipates a launch of the First Home scheme website in early June, with a full scheme deployment shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Project Tosaigh was also announced through the Housing for All strategy. Under this initiative, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency, who will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently in the process of finalising agreements with prospective proposers for the initial tranche of affordable homes delivered through this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO Wholesale Price Index shows the annual increase for building and construction materials to be 16.9% to the end of March 2022. Construction costs have risen considerably over recent years through a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and general increases in labour and materials costs.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All commits that the Government and relevant State agencies will advance methods to reduce residential construction costs, particularly the cost of apartment construction, by increasing the focus of existing and planned construction related initiatives on the residential construction sector, and by ensuring a coordinated, whole-of-government, approach to residential construction.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government will enhance the intended role of the new Construction Technology Centre, which is under development by Enterprise Ireland, beyond the standard remit of Technology Centres in general for its first three years of operation in order to prioritise residential construction, in particular by incorporating:<\/p>  <p>  - structures and funding to enable innovation in residential construction prior to the National Standards Authority of Ireland compliance processes, including demonstration, certification, standardisation and commercialisation as well as research and development;<\/p>  <p>  - a proactive role in strengthening the residential construction value chain;<\/p>  <p>  - promotion, development and support for innovation \/ modern methods of construction (MMCs) using digital and manufacturing technology;<\/p>  <p>  - support for SMEs to develop scale and to adopt MMCs and Building Information Modelling techniques for residential construction; and<\/p>  <p>  - support for digitisation in the manufacturing sector for residential construction e.g. digitally controlled manufacturing equipment.<\/p>  <p>  This will be complemented by an increased focus for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group (CSG) on the residential construction sector. This will include the introduction and full implementation of a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures, in line with its established remit to improve productivity and efficiency, and to temper price inflation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the CSG supported by my Department are also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost (including cost of compliance) and increasing standardisation. It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Government departments and industry.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Government policy, social and affordable housing construction projects (as with all publicly funded construction projects), must be procured in accordance with the Capital Works Management Framework. The Office of Government (OGP) is responsible for implementing national policy on public procurement, particularly in relation to construction procurement.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP continues to review the situation and introduced the following interim measures last year to address the impact that price increases in construction materials is having on public works tenders:<\/p>  <p>  - Reduced fixed price period duration to 24 months (previously 30 months minimum).<\/p>  <p>  - Permit mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15% (previously 50%)<\/p>  <p>  - Introduction of a new mechanism to address the period between tender submission and award through limited indexation of the tender price<\/p>  <p>  The above measures relate to new public works contracts going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000074#WRO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[22618\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000074#WRO02975","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans for an urgent review of the funding available for affordable purchase housing and for the provision of sufficient funding to meet the requirements of the local authority housing lists and other middle-income groups currently unable to house themselves other than by way of exorbitant rents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":725,"content":"<p>Exchequer investment from the National Development Plan, together with Housing Finance Agency lending and Land Development Agency investment will mean that some &euro;4 billion in State funding will be available for housing every year from 2021-2025.

The full text of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 is available from the following link: www.irishstatutebook.ie\/eli\/2021\/act\/25\/enacted\/en\/html<\/p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme has already seen new homes made available by Local Authorities for purchase by eligible applicants. This includes locations in Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin South County Dublin and Dun Emer in Lusk, Fingal.  Under the scheme, homes are made available at significant reductions on market prices based on an eligible buyer's purchasing ability.  The Local Authority will take a percentage equity stake in the home in recognition of the State support. The scheme is primarily targeted at First Time Buyers, though Section 10 of the Affordable Housing Act sets provisions for eligibility exceptions for the scheme, which are part of the Government's 'Fresh Start' strategy as detailed in the <i>Housing for All<\/i>strategy. Broadly, the provisions include an exception for those who previously purchased or constructed a home with a spouse or partner but who are now divorced or legally separated or whose relationship has ended, or who have undergone an insolvency process, and who now have no financial interest in the previous home.<\/p><p>The First Home Scheme will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in Local Authority Affordable Purchase. The scheme aims to support the purchase of c. 8,000 new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026. First Home will only support purchases of homes within regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by First Time Buyers in the area, so the scheme is targeted at the lower region of the market. Like the Local Authority scheme, First Home is primarily targeted at First Time Buyers, with certain exemptions. The intention is to mirror the 'Fresh Start' provisions of the Local Authority scheme for people who are divorced or separated or whose relationship has ended, or have undergone insolvency, and who now have no financial interest in the previous home. It is intended that full details of the First Home Scheme will be available online on a dedicated website in June in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s deployment shortly thereafter.<\/p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 and now incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds for single applicants in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (increasing from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000), and more flexibility on house size. The maximum income threshold for joint applications is &euro;75,000 in all counties. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property. The maximum market values are &euro;320,000 in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and &euro;250,000 in the rest of the country.

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the successful roll out of the Covid vaccine programme and the reopening of society, the normal DMP was reinstated from 6 September 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Tenants that incurred arrears during the Covid-19 emergency were given additional time to engage with the HAP Debt Management Unit to clear their arrears, as well as access to payment plans as a specific Covid measure. Under the normal HAP DMP payment plans are not offered or available to tenants at this stage of the process. The HAP SSC have now resumed the standard debt management process.<\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000075#WRP05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation","counter":810,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000075#WRP05100"},{"type":"question","counter":811,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[23246\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000075#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the difference between the Quality Standards Framework that applies to voluntary sector homeless emergency accommodation and the Quality Standards Framework as it applied to private providers of emergency homeless accommodation in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":812,"content":"<p>The Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the statutory role of local authorities in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons.<\/p>  <p>  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services, and is designed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In summary there are 8 themes under which the NQSF\u00a0standards are organised.\u00a0Themes 1-4 focus on the provision of person centred services, which are safe and effective, and support the rights and equal treatment of persons at risk of or experiencing homelessness.\u00a0Themes 5-8 focus on the organisational capability and capacity to deliver high quality services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a number of facilities are operated privately in the Dublin Region, the DRHE have adapted the NQSF standards in order to apply their provisions to private emergency accommodation.\u00a0\u00a0As happened with the NGO sector, this will involve a scaling up of standards over time.\u00a0The Quality Standards for private emergency accommodation are framed\u00a0under the same eight themes\u00a0in the NQSF.\u00a0The standards inform service users as to what they can expect from homeless services and ensures that service providers are clear in their responsibility to delivery safe, effective and consistently high standard services.\u00a0\u00a0Under the\u00a0Quality\u00a0Standards for Private Emergency Accommodation,\u00a0the owner\/operator are responsible for the physical standards and the visiting support teams responsible for the support and case management standards.\u00a0It is understood that the DRHE appointed a Development Officer in January 2022, to roll out these standards in private emergency accommodation and to co-ordinate training with the HSE for staff working in these settings.\u00a0The Development Officer will also\u00a0co-ordinate quarterly key performance indicator (KPI) returns.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In Dublin the oversight and operation of standards is a matter for the DRHE.\u00a0 \u00a0Both the NQSF and Quality\u00a0Standards for Private Emergency Accommodation are available\u00a0on the DRHE website at www.homelessdublin.ie\/info\/publications?type=&amp;year=&amp;keyword=quality+standards<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000075#WRP05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":813,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000075#WRP05400"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[23266\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000075#WRP05500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he will publish the qualifying criteria associated with the new &euro;50 million funding scheme recently announce at targeting the wastewater collection and treatment needs of villages and settlements without access to public wastewater services;

It contains the objectives, policies and supporting actions which the Government considers necessary to support the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.<\/p>  <p>  The NMPF includes a detailed section on fisheries (section 16) and a series of policies on fisheries, which will inform the assessment of all planning applications in the maritime area. Any proposal that may have a significant adverse impact must demonstrate how it will, in order of preference, (a) avoid, (b) minimise or (c) mitigate any such impact. These measures will have to be addressed in the planning application and will be assessed by the relevant planning authority. <\/p>  <p>  The NMPF will be the key consideration for assessing applications for marine authorisations and making a balanced decision, taking into account the various marine activities, including fisheries. All applications for development will be considered in terms of their consistency with the objectives of the plan. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Maritime Planning Act 2021 facilitates public consultation on applications for development in the maritime area. This allows those with fishing interests to make submissions on applications for development. The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended) require planning authorities to give notice of valid planning applications to certain prescribed bodies where the development would be relevant to the functions of that body. Reports prepared by prescribed bodies and submitted to the relevant planning authorities are considered as part of the assessment of the planning application. My officials are preparing secondary legislation, which will address the identification of prescribed bodies for maritime applications. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the setting up of a Seafood\/Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) working group is at an advanced stage. This will assist the managed introduction of the offshore renewables industry into the maritime area.  The initial stated aim of the working group will be to agree a communications protocol between these two strategically important maritime sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The position of chairperson to this group was recently advertised and attracted strong interest from a broad range of suitably qualified candidates. My Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, conducted a shortlisting process and subsequently interviewed the shortlisted candidates. I expect a recommendation from my officials as to the nomination for chairperson in the coming days and I will then move to appoint the chairperson as a matter of priority, with the aim of holding the inception meeting of the Seafood\/ORE working group at the earliest available opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[23345\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the exact nature and objectives of discussions between Ireland and Iran to expand bilateral relations.","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>My Department maintains dialogue with Iranian counterparts on a wide range of bilateral and international issues.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important roles Ireland has been given on the Security Council is as Facilitator of Resolution 2231, covering the Iranian nuclear deal, the JCPOA.

This campaign ran over print, broadcast and digital mediums, as well as stadium, event and airport advertising. It included advertisements in national and local radio, as well as advertisements in national press, during a two week period in January. Further activity is planned for the second half of the year across digital, social media, print and radio. <\/p>  <p>  Since late January, all Passport Service sites in Dublin and Cork have been operating at full capacity following the ending of many Covid-19 public health restrictions, and all services have fully resumed as they were in place before the pandemic. The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to book a counter appointment and renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin and within 4 days in Cork. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 183,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.<\/p>  <p>  Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p>  <p>  -  30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online (applications received from 19 April)<\/p>  <p>  -  8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  In addition, 45% of adult renewal online applications are issued within one to two working days of receipt.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service has recently reduced the turnaround time for first time applications from 40 working days to 30 working days. This is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services: <\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  - A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications. <\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  - In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. <\/p>  <p>  - A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants. <\/p>  <p>  - There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application. <\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":863,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[22555\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if an emergency passport application will be expedited for a person (details supplied);

We believe that the Security Council has an important role to play, given the impact on national and regional peace and security.  Since the conflict began in November 2020, there have been 14 meetings of the Council on Ethiopia. Ireland has played a leading role on the Council, particularly in negotiating statements that, despite difficult dynamics, have achieved unanimous support in calling for unhindered humanitarian access, a ceasefire and a national dialogue. Ireland has also repeatedly raised the need for accountability for the widespread human rights abuses and atrocities that have been committed by all sides in the conflict.  <\/p>  <p>  Ethiopia was most recently discussed at the Security Council on 14 April, when the focus was on the humanitarian situation.  At that meeting, Ireland called for immediate implementation of the recently agreed humanitarian truce, and delivery of humanitarian assistance to those most in need.  <\/p>  <p>  Putting Ethiopia on the formal agenda of the Council would require support around the table, and the reality is that some current members of the Council do not want this. Despite these challenges, responding to the acute humanitarian crisis in Tigray and Ethiopia more generally will remain an urgent priority for Ireland during our term on the Council and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Coveney continues to engage on the situation in Ethiopia with key interlocutors in the region including African Union Special Envoy Obasanjo. Minister Coveney also met with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Deputy Prime Minister\/Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen in February, and stressed the need for full humanitarian access and an end to hostilities; restoration of basic services; and political dialogue. We continue to advocate for an effective response to the situation through a full range of regular and ongoing contacts with Ethiopia, including in Addis Ababa, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva, as well as in EU forums in Brussels.  <\/p>  <p>  The publication on 3 November of the findings of the joint investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in Tigray was a vital first step towards accountability. I look forward to full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and progress on investigations. Ireland also supports the decision of the Human Rights Council in December to establish an international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia and welcomes the recent appointment of the members of the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":892,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":893,"content":"<p>Question No. 394 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":894,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ07000"},{"type":"question","counter":895,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[22734\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ07100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of first-time passport applications that have been escalated in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[22735\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ07200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of first-time passport applications that have been escalated more than once in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":897,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[22736\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ07300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the average length of time between a first-time passport application being escalated and the passport being issued.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":898,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[22737\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ07400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total number of first-time passport applications made to his Department in 2022; and the number of applications that went over 30 working days.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":899,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395, 396, 397 and 398 together.<\/p><p>The Passport Service does not maintain records of passport applications that have been expedited. <\/p><p>The Passport Service has a dedicated Travel Emergency team that work to expedite passport applications in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. <\/p><p>In these cases, if the application is fully complete and has all required supporting documentation, the Passport Service will aim to issue the passport to the applicant in a matter of days, whilst still carrying out all the necessary checks to ensure that the integrity of the Irish passport is maintained. <\/p><p>If the Passport Service becomes aware of an application that has passed its estimated issue by date or has experienced delays due to an error on the side of the Passport Service, the Passport Service will prioritise the application to ensure that no further delays are experienced by the applicant. <\/p><p>The vast majority of applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>- 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p><p>The Passport Service has recently reduced the average turnaround time for first time applications from 40 working days to 30 working days. This reduction in processing time is as a direct result of the staffing and resources my Department has invested in the Passport Service. The Passport Service is focused on reducing this processing time even further in the coming months. <\/p><p>The Passport Service has received 100,000 first time applications since the beginning of this year. The Passport Service has issued 70,000 first time passports since the beginning of this year. <\/p><p>The average turnaround time for first time applications received prior to 7<sup><\/sup>March 2022 was 40 working days. First time applications received after this date had an average turnaround time of 35 working days, until 19 April when the average turnaround time for first time applications received from that date was reduced to 30 working days.  Therefore, all first time applications received prior to 19 April will have anturnaround time of greater than 30 days. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. Out of a total of 183,000 passport applications currently with the Passport Service, 88,000 or 48% are for first time applications. Approximately, half of all first time applications are for children.<\/p><p>37,700 or 43% of current first time applications are incomplete. This means that the applicant has either not sent any documentation after they apply online or additional documentation has been requested by the Passport Service. The Passport Service simply cannot process applications that are not complete.<\/p><p>There is a rigorous checking process in place for first time applications. The Passport Service must ensure the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the integrity of the passport itself and the rights of the child and their guardians.  <\/p><p>Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures involved by highly trained and experienced staff, first time passport applications currently take 30 working days to process. In more complex cases, unfortunately, it can take longer.<\/p><p>My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.<\/p><p>Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.  In addition to this, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels to meet the expected demand in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.<\/p><p>It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times for first time applications in 2022. Along with increased staffing, the Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service: <\/p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications. <\/p><p>- Passport Service staff are working overtime with a focus on prioritising first time applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. <\/p><p>- A new document management process has been put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. <\/p><p>My Department is confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000076#WRQ07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":900,"content":"<p>Question No. 396 answered with Question No. 395.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":901,"content":"<p>Question No. 397 answered with Question No. 395.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":902,"content":"<p>Question No. 398 answered with Question No. 395.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":903,"content":"<p>Question No. 399 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":904,"content":"<p>Question No. 400 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":906,"content":"<p>Question No. 401 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":907,"content":"<p>Question No. 402 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":908,"content":"<p>Question No. 403 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":909,"content":"<p>Question No. 404 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[22939\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000077#WRR00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the passport applications by persons (details supplied) will be expedited.","asker":"1568","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":912,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific applications about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has issued passports to two of the applicants and has provided an update as to the steps the applicant must take to progress the third application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000077#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000077#WRR00900"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[22943\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000077#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 79 of 23 March 2022, the status of any bilateral engagement he has had with his counterparts in Saudi Arabia with a view to bringing about an end to the war in Yemen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>Yemen is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, driven by seven years of conflict, economic collapse and the breakdown of public institutions and services which has left millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p><p>Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, to bring about a political resolution to the conflict in Yemen.

In 2020, for example, my Department assisted more than 8,000 citizens to return to Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Informed by the particular circumstances of the pandemic, my Department now has in place a comprehensive approach to supporting, where appropriate, significant groups of Irish citizens requiring repatriation from overseas in crisis situations. In general, citizen repatriation is facilitated through commercial flight options while these remain available.  The second preference is to help facilitate citizen repatriation through charter flights operated by EU partners &ndash; under the EU&rsquo;s Civil Protection Mechanism &ndash; or by other international partners.  As a last resort, where no other options are available and where specified conditions are met, my Department may explore the chartering of an aircraft to facilitate stranded citizens to return to Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Where citizens are carried on flights chartered by the Government or by EU or other international partners, every effort is made to ensure that fares are set at a reasonable level and that passengers are billed in advance of travel.

Detailed procedures to oversee the recoupment of funds are in place.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 December 2021, in exceptional circumstances, my Department arranged for a charter flight to assist 156 people to return to Ireland from Morocco, following the suspension by the Moroccan authorities of regular commercial flights.

The next BIIGC is scheduled to take place in June. <\/p><p>For our part, the Government published a series of commitments, at the time of NDNA, focused on working with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. Although Covid 19 has been the understandable focus in the time since the NDNA was reached, nevertheless progress has been made to implement those important commitments.<\/p><p>The package of language and identity legislation agreed in New Decade New Approach was detailed and balanced and should be implemented without delay &ndash; as should all the commitments in NDNA.

It should be advanced on the basis of the legislative provisions negotiated, agreed and published at the time of NDNA.  I look forward to seeing progress on this legislation in Westminster as soon as possible, as committed to by the Secretary of State.<\/p><p>As part of the NDNA, it was also agreed that there would be regular review meetings involving the two Governments at Ministerial level and the parties to monitor progress on its implementation, and the delivery of commitments by each Government.  On 11 January 2021, I participated in the first Implementation Review Meeting alongside the First Minister, deputy First Minister, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and party leaders in Northern Ireland.

Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can deliver peace, in line with international humanitarian law as well as international human rights norms and standards, and which respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.<\/p><p>I witnessed with my own eyes the shocking aftermath of the devastation in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. I expressed to the Mayor of Bucha, Mr. Anatoliy Fedoruk, the sincere condolences of the Irish Government and people. I committed to bearing witness to these terrible atrocities and to raising the situation internationally. Those who perpetrated these heinous crimes must be brought to justice.<\/p><p>On 19 April, as I promised to the mayor of Bucha and Foreign Minister Kuleba, I briefed the UN Security Council on my visit to Ukraine. I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued. 503 civilians had been identified at that stage - and just 4 soldiers. At the UN Security Council, I was clear that these facts speak to an utter disregard by Russian forces for their clear and unambiguous obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians. Ireland will continue to use our membership on the UN Security Council to hold Russia accountable for its actions.<\/p><p>Ireland is one of over 40 countries that referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is providing a further &euro;3 million to the ICC. Investigation teams from the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC are already actively collecting evidence from Ukraine. <\/p><p>On 4 May, the European Commission presented proposals for a sixth package of sanctions aimed at depriving Russia and Belarus of the ability to wage war on Ukraine.  The package will include additional listings of individuals and entities, including high-ranking military officers and other individuals deemed to have been involved in committing atrocities in Bucha and in the siege of the city of Mariupol. The package also targets additional Russian and Belarussian banks, including Sberbank, Russia's largest bank. Three big Russian state-owned broadcasters responsible for Russian state propaganda will be sanctioned, and will be unable to distribute their content in any form in the EU or attract advertising.  The package also targets services, including accountancy, public relations and consultancy services to Russian companies.  <\/p><p>A complete import ban on all Russian oil is also proposed, to be introduced in an orderly fashion, it is hoped agreement can be reached soon to ensure that EU Member States can secure alternative supplies. Crude oil will be phased out within six months, and refined products such as petrol and diesel by the end of the year. There are also provisions to prevent Russia from diversifying its client base for oil products, including a ban on the provision of insurance and financing for the shipping of Russian oil.Ireland has allocated &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, via the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN agencies. Additionally, at EU level, Ireland has contributed &euro;11.5m to an EU humanitarian assistance package of &euro;550m.<\/p><p>The EU is providing a &euro;1.5 billion package of European Peace Facility (EPF) support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Ireland is contributing its full share (&euro;33 million), which will go towards non-lethal elements only.<\/p><p>As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU Membership.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than county or country of residence of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in \"Passport Express\" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. The Passport Service continues to see a steady and increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and Passport Express very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.<\/p>  <p>  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround.

These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":969,"content":"<p>Question No. 429 answered with Question No. 389.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":970,"content":"<p>Question No. 430 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":972,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[23368\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a passport will issue for a toddler (details supplied) in Dublin 9; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":973,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service regrets the delay in processing this application and is prioritising it so that no further delay is experienced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":974,"content":"<p>Question No. 432 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":975,"content":"<p>Question No. 433 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":976,"content":"<p>Question No. 434 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":977,"content":"<p>Question No. 435 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":978,"content":"<p>Question No. 436 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":979,"content":"<p>Question No. 437 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[23409\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the passport application by a person (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":982,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service regrets the delay in processing this application.

The recent Russian invasion of Ukraine has, of course, drastically escalated the conflict beyond these areas.<\/p>  <p>  On 2 March 2022, Ireland joined a group of concerned States Parties to the Statute in referring the situation in Ukraine to the ICC.

In addition to a &euro;20 million Irish Aid humanitarian package which has been disbursed to organisations active on the ground in Ukraine or its immediate neighbours, prepositioned Irish Aid funds with key UN agencies, and the ICRC, meant that those organisations were able to respond on the ground in Ukraine immediately.  <\/p>  <p>  This funding complements the generous contributions made by so many citizens to Irish and other humanitarian organisations who are responding to the needs of those affected by the conflict, many of whom receive core funding from Irish Aid. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have activated the Rapid Response Register, with experts from the Register deploying to UN partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.<\/p>  <p>  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has called for Russia&rsquo;s immediate withdrawal of troops from the entire territory of Ukraine, demanded that the Russian Federation uphold its obligations under international law and encouraged the international community to provide all possible support to the Ukrainian people. On 5 May 2022, An Taoiseach participated in a pledging conference that raised &euro;6.15 billion in humanitarian and economic supports for Ukraine. Together the EU and its Member States have provided nearly &euro;1 billion in humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  Conscious of wider global humanitarian need, itself being affected by the invasion of Ukraine and its impact, for example, on world food prices, Irish Aid continues to respond generously to those most impacted by other crises, including Syria, Yemen and Somalia. Ireland hosted an Arria Formula meeting at the UNSC last month on Conflict and Hunger to draw international attention to the impact of the war in Ukraine on global food security and the need to continue to support other humanitarian crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":992,"content":"<p>Question No. 444 answered with Question No. 413.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Aid","counter":993,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":994,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[23420\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which bilateral and multilateral aid is currently being directed to the various locations in serious need at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":995,"content":"<p>A Better World, Ireland's international development policy, focuses Irish Aid&rsquo;s work on meeting the needs of the furthest behind first, with an emphasis on those in the world&rsquo;s poorest or climate-exposed countries, especially women and girls.  <\/p>  <p>  The allocation to Official Development Assistance for 2022 is &euro;1 billion, the highest ever and a 20% increase on last year&rsquo;s allocation. This will allow Ireland to maintain its longstanding focus on meeting the needs of people furthest behind, such as those affected by food insecurity and conflict.  Among the areas of focus this year are Ukraine, the Horn of Africa, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, as well as countries in the Sahel.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that our resources reach those in greatest need is central to our work and our ability to do so is well-recognised.

Our previous membership of the Council (2013-15) enabled us to contribute substantively to the promotion and protection of human rights. In order to continue this work, Ireland intends to seek our next term on the HRC for the period 2027 &ndash; 2029.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to ensuring that the UN is capable of continuous reform to adapt to emerging as well as to traditional global challenges, including in the field of human rights. We work closely with EU partners including the EU Special Representative on Human Rights, Mr Eamon Gilmore, to ensure that the Human Rights Council, Special Procedures, and the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies are continuously strengthened to ensure an effective response to human rights violations and abuses. <\/p>  <p>  The nature and scale of human rights cases under investigation by the UN varies from national Commissions of Inquiry to individual complaints to the Treaty Bodies. As such, consolidated figures on the number of cases are not available.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is a committed supporter of the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of a strong international criminal justice system. We are providing a &euro;3 million in funding which will assist with regard to all situations before the court. Currently, the Office of the Prosecutor is engaged in 17 investigations and 10 preliminary examinations across 25 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries.<\/p>  <p>  There are five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and has indicated an intention to submit a formal application for EU membership during 2022.<\/p>  <p>  On 28 February, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine submitted a letter to the Presidency formally applying for membership of the European Union, in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty.  In light of the grave situation facing Ukraine, President Zelenskyy requested that the application be treated under &lsquo;a special procedure&rsquo;. Three days later Georgia and Moldova followed suit, submitting their letters of application on 03 March.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, EU relations with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are set within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. &lsquo;Association Agreements&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements&rsquo; (DCFTAs) are in place with all three aimed at promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and ensuring respect for common values. While some progress has been made over the years towards closer integration with the EU, progress on reforms has been slow overall.<\/p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s application was discussed at the informal European Council meeting on 10 &amp;amp; 11 March. This resulted in the &lsquo;Versailles Declaration&rsquo;, which acknowledged the &ldquo;European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine&rdquo;. The European Council also invited the Commission to submit its opinion on all three applications in accordance with the established procedures, while noting that &ldquo;Ukraine belongs to our European family&rdquo;. The European Council meeting on 24-25 March again reaffirmed Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective and reiterated its invitation to the Commission to submit its opinion in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties. It is not clear at this stage when the Commission will submit its formal Opinion on all three applications though the analysis required understandably takes time and in the past, it has taken up to three years for the Commission to revert to the Council with their opinion.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the European perspective of the Eastern Partnership&rsquo;s associated partners, Ukraine, Moldova &amp;amp; Georgia. Ukraine in particular has made impressive progress in aligning with EU standards and deserves recognition for their efforts to defend European values. We have come together with a grouping of other EU Member States who are similarly strongly supportive of Ukraine&rsquo;s application, with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.  The EU should encourage and support Ukraine&rsquo;s application, though we should not minimise the steps that remain to be taken. There is no provision at present for any kind of &lsquo;associated membership&rsquo; for those countries submitting formal membership applications. <\/p>  <p>  In the Western Balkans, current issues relating to the enlargement process largely revolve around the commitment to opening Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs) with Albania and North Macedonia. The main obstacle to agreement is Bulgaria&rsquo;s continued objection to moving ahead with opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia due to bilateral difficulties related to the Macedonian language, the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia, and the implementation of the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations. Discussions are continuing between the Bulgarian and North Macedonian governments to resolve the issues and both countries are to be commended for their efforts to promote closer cooperation and improved relations. <\/p>  <p>  The EU is continuing to encourage greater reform efforts on the part of Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in relation to Rule of Law and promotion of good governance. Serbia&rsquo;s non-alignment with the EU common position relating to Russia has also been of concern recently.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000078#WRS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1007,"content":"<p>Question No. 448 answered with Question No. 447.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1008,"content":"<p>Question No. 449 answered with Question No. 446.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1010,"content":"<p>Question No. 450 answered with Question No. 447.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1011,"content":"<p>Question No. 451 answered with Question No. 447.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":1012,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000079#WRT00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1013,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[23432\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000079#WRT00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which undocumented Irish in the United States can expect to have their situations resolved; the extent to which he has had discussions with his United States counterparts on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1014,"content":"<p>Providing ongoing support, along with finding long-term solutions, to address the challenges faced by the undocumented Irish in the US, remains a key priority for this Government. <\/p><p>The issue was raised during our high-level political engagements over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period across the US, not least at the bilateral exchange between the Taoiseach and President Biden.

My advice to those seeking to apply for a US visa or for a visa waiver is to get information from the website of the US Embassy in Dublin and to engage with them directly on their application. <\/p>  <p>  In recent days, officials from my Department have discussed the matter with the US Embassy, who are working hard to minimise waiting times and have recently dedicated extra resources to the processing of J1 visa applications, which is expected to result in a significant increase in the number being processed in the coming days and weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000079#WRT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1030,"content":"<p>Question No. 459 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":1032,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000079#WRT02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Media","counter":1031,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000079#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1032,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[23044\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000079#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the percentage of social media posts made on each of his Departmental social media accounts or the social media accounts of public bodies and agencies that operate under his remit that were exclusively in Irish between 1 May 2021 and 30 April 2022, inclusive; the percentage of same that feature bilingual translations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1033,"content":"<p>My Department attempts to take every opportunity in its day-to-day interactions with customers to promote and publicise the services it provides.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s fourth Irish Language Scheme, covering the period 2022-2025, came into effect in February.

As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they too will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.<\/p>  <p>  My Department held consultations with education stakeholders and advocacy groups, following this, steps were taken to encourage more schools to participate including the following: the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, arrangements to pay staff sooner, greater guidance, an online payments portal for schools, and greater flexibility in the timing of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  The complexities of organising a summer programme in special school environments is recognised and further enhanced funding for special schools is being provided this year including increase capitation and preparation to support these schools.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns around availability of staff have been further addressed with the provision to recruit final year student teachers and student teachers registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5. To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, principals may delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. Overseers, teachers and SNAs who work on the programme will be paid for this work based on what they are normally paid during the school year in addition to their normal salary.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021 377 special schools and schools with special classes ran a programme, with in the region of 5,587 pupils attending. For context in 2011 there were 149 schools and 2,461 pupils attending the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; programme. The number of special schools running a programme under the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; scheme had fallen from 54 in 2011 to 34 in 2019. It is important to note that we have actually seen an increase in the number of special schools running a programme in both 2020 and 2021 with 39 special schools taking part in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. It is important that the home-based programme provides support for the education and\/or care needs of students with complex needs during the summer break period.<\/p>  <p>  Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents\/legal guardians can engage the services of a teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home.  Schools are requested to provide parents with the contact details of a teacher\/SNA where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000080#WRU03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1095,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000080#WRU03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1096,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[22769\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000080#WRU03750","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the terms and conditions since 2013, that include a requirement that a person must be registered on the Teaching Council&rsquo;s register of teachers in order to be eligible to become an examination superintendent.

The NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle involved an extensive range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders, including teachers.<\/p>  <p>  The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to:<\/p>  <p>  - Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century<\/p>  <p>  - Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system<\/p>  <p>  - Embed wellbeing and reduce student stress levels<\/p>  <p>  The reforms I announced include initiatives to spread the assessment load for students and do so in a way that enhances student wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  Bearing in mind the significant assessment load at the end of sixth year, as an interim measure I have asked the SEC to immediately alter the timing of Paper One in both Irish and English so that Paper One would take place at the end of fifth year commencing for fifth years entering fifth year in September 2023.<\/p>  <p>  In making this announcement, I have responded to a broad consensus for spreading the assessment load. In this regard, the NCCA Advisory Report emphasised the need to reduce the focus on the final examination period and the stress experienced by students associated with this time.<\/p>  <p>  Since September last, the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has held a number of hearings on Senior Cycle reform. Throughout these hearings, a desire to spread assessment over a greater period has been a recurring theme on which there has been broad consensus.<\/p>  <p>  I have also listened to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which made a number of concluding observations in its 2016 periodic report on Ireland.  The Committee expressed its concern about the pressure that the Leaving Certificate examination places on children and recommended that Ireland consider reforming the Leaving Certificate to reduce the stress caused to children.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, I have also listened to students themselves who have called for the spread of assessment and striking a balance between final exams and other forms of assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the SEC is a statutory body established in 2003 under the Education Act, 1998.

The management of the State examinations, including the marking of examinations and the timing of the marking, are matters for the SEC. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said, altering the timing of Paper One in Irish and English is an interim measure designed to spread the assessment load and thereby reduce the stress experienced by students, pending the full development of a variety of examination components in all subjects.

There are well established allocation SNA: student ratios for students with particular disabilities enrolled in both special classes and special schools.

The language has particular social, historical and educational importance and is part of the unique cultural heritage of the Irish people. Irish is also an official language of the European Union.  It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.<\/p>  <p>  In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and secondary level schools and centres for education in Ireland.  This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of Irish in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  All students in Primary and Second Level schools are required to study Irish unless they have been granted a Certificate of Exemption from the study of Irish.  <\/p>  <p>  The long-standing practice of the Department has been to use circulars as a means for communicating a number of matters including schemes, rules and other conditions associated with the recognition and funding of schools, and setting the terms and conditions of school staff.  Much of that practice evolved in the absence of primary legislation governing the education sector.  Following a national convention in the mid-1990s, a programme of educational reform was initiated. For the first time, this included the enactment of landmark pieces of primary legislation governing the school system. This included the Education Act 1998, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  While such legislation does permit of the making of regulations in a number of areas, regulations are not required in all situations.  The practice of using administrative circulars which is familiar to schools, teachers and other school staff, and which allows for a necessary degree of flexibility and responsiveness has continued. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language.  Section 6 of the Act provides that every person concerned with the implementation of the Act shall have regard to objects specified therein. These objects include contributing to the realisation of national policy and objectives in relation to the extension of bilingualism in Irish society and in particular the achievement of a greater use of the Irish language at school and in the community (Section 6(i)) and contributing to the maintenance of Irish as the primary community language in Gaeltacht areas (Section 6(j)).  The responsibilities of the Department  in respect of the teaching and promotion of Irish are also apparent from Sections 7(2)(d); 9(f) and (h); 13(3)(f); 31, 41(2)(g); 62(7)(h) and 62(9) thereof.<\/p>  <p>  Rule 70(3) of the Rules for National Schools (1965) lists Irish as an obligatory subject for pupils in National Schools and Curricula for Irish are prescribed by the minister in accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act 1998. Rule 21(1) of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools 2004\/2005 provides that the approved course for a post-primary school student must include not less than five of the subjects of which one must be Irish.  Students are not required to sit an Irish examination nor is it a requirement to pass an Irish Examination in order to complete the Junior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate.  In that context, the most recent curricular changes at primary and junior cycle level have emphasised not only the importance of learning both languages but also the wider benefits of bilingualism.  The development of these new language curricula reflects my department&rsquo;s reassertion of its commitment to the Irish language and to progressing the language education related actions of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000081#WRV06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000081#WRV06600"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[23179\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000081#WRV06700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Meath; her plans to ensure this school is ready to open for the 2023\/2024 academic year; and if she has encountered delays in the schedule of works to date.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1183,"content":"<p>The permanent accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme.This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Management team to progress the project through the stages of architectural planning, tendering and construction.  <\/p><p>It is anticipated that the project for the school referred to by the Deputy will be included in the next bundle of projects to proceed to tender later this year.

This would be more effective in meeting policy objectives and in enhancing value for money than introducing additional small scale supports for those who face minor additional costs of disability.<\/p><p>- That the levels of disability payments and allowances should be changed to reflect the very different costs of disability by severity and type of disability.<\/p><p>In Budget 2022 a number of measures were introduced to support people with disabilities and carers. <\/p><p>- An increase across core social welfare payments\/rates. (Increases to the weekly rates of payment for working age recipients under 66 years of age) by &euro;5 per week, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates).<\/p><p>- Increase to the income disregard for Carer's Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.<\/p><p>- Increase to the Capital Disregard for Carer's Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.<\/p><p>- Extension to the period during which Domiciliary Care Allowance can be paid for children in hospital from three months to six months (including payment of Carer's Allowance for this period).<\/p><p>- Increase to the upper earnings disregard limit for Disability Allowance, by &euro;25 per week, from  &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week.<\/p><p>- Increase in the rate of the Wage Subsidy Scheme for private sector employers by &euro;1 per hour (equivalent to 60% of National Minimum Wage)<\/p><p>Three grants, currently available through Intreo centres, to also be available through EmployAbility contractors in 2022; these are: <\/p><p>- Job Interview Interpreter Grant <\/p><p>- Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant <\/p><p>- Personal Reader Grant<\/p><p>Increase to the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance to &euro;7.60 (was &euro;2.50 per week).<\/p><p>- Extension to the eligibility for the disregard of PhD scholarship income, in the means test, to recipients of the Blind Pension.<\/p><p>- Introduction of a grant of up to &euro;500 in any calendar year towards the purchase of wigs\/hairpieces\/hair replacement system in cases of hair loss due to illness or treatment of an illness.<\/p><p>- Increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week - with immediate effect.  This increase was paid from early November 2021.  The weekly means threshold was also increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120. <\/p><p>Increase to the Living Alone Allowance (LAA) of &euro;3, from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week.  The LAA is an additional payment made each week to:<\/p><p>- people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, including State pensions, and who are living alone;<\/p><p>- people who are less than 66 years of age, living alone and in receipt of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Incapacity Supplement or Blind Pension.<\/p><p>Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion (2020-2025) and Pathways to Work (2021-2025) strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to simplify the system and take account of the concerns expressed in the Make Work Pay report&rsquo;, and a review the current long-term disability payment schemes with a view to removing inconsistencies\/anomalies and ensuring that they recognise the continuum of disabilities and support employment&rsquo;.<\/p><p>This work is currently underway within my Department, with a public consultation process to commence in due course.<\/p><p>The estimated additional cost to the Exchequer of a weekly cost of disability payment of &euro;20, &euro;30 and &euro;40 is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"4\">Estimated additional cost to the Exchequer of a weekly cost of disability payment of &euro;20, &euro;30 and &euro;40<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>264,960 <\/td>       <td>&euro;20 <\/td>       <td>x 52 <\/td>       <td>&euro;276m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>264,960<\/td>       <td>&euro;30 <\/td>       <td>x 52 <\/td>       <td>&euro;413m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>264,960<\/td>       <td>&euro;40 <\/td>       <td>x 52 <\/td>       <td>&euro;551m<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>* note: the estimate is based only on persons in receipt of the following payments (at the end of 2021): Domiciliary Care Allowance, Partial Capacity Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and Disablement Benefit.

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. <\/p>  <p>  While the caring requirements of carees may be different, this does not affect the rates of the allowance, which is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.    <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that payments made by my Department are set out in legislation.  There is no provision to provide flexibility in relation to means testing thresholds for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as outlined by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  From June the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will increase to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse\/partner.<\/p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department.  These include the following changes to the carer means test which will take effect in June:  <\/p>  <p>  -  An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse\/partner,<\/p>  <p>  -  An increase in the Capital\/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. <\/p>  <p>  A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  My Department already provides a non means-tested payment specifically for carers of incapacitated children in the form of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).  This is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  The payment is not based on the type of disability but on the resulting physical or mental impairment which means that the child requires substantially more care and attention than another child of the same age. Since 1 June 2017, all children getting DCA are eligible for a medical card without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all family carers providing full time care and assistance regardless of means. As part of Budget 2021, I increased the Grant from its then current rate of &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850, effective from June 2021.  The estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant this year is &euro;262.4 million.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the key role that family carers play in Irish society and the challenges they face.  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to the current supports provided by my Department &ndash; such as introducing further changes to the means testing of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or additional payment supports - would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary and policy context.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000083#WRX05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":1323,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000083#WRX06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1324,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[23333\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000083#WRX06100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the up-to-date position regarding a social welfare appeal for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1325,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 18 February 2022.

This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.<\/p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.<\/p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1352,"qnumday":573,"qnumall":"[22758\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY02400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1353,"content":"<p>While the NCS is an initiative of my Department, a Scheme Administrator has been engaged to manage the daily operations of the NCS on behalf of DCEDIY.

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.<\/p>  <p>  Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out. <\/p>  <p>  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same.\u00a0Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE services in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to staffing requirements implied by statutory ratios.<\/p>  <p>  City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at\u00a0myccc.ie\/where-is-my-nearest-ccc.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees public funding for the employment of graduates in ELC more fairly distributed across the system.<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than services opening fewer hours or offering fewer places. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is calculated based on the hours that the service is open and available to children.\u00a0However, non-contact time is factored into the base rate in two ways. Firstly, data from Sector Profile on current amount of contact and non-contact time for different grades of staff was used to build in an allowance for non-contact time into the allocation for staff costs. Secondly, there is a separate allocation for administrative staff\/time.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately two thirds of the funding for Core Funding is intended to contribute to improved pay rates across different categories of staff. This portion of the budget cannot be made available without assurances that this funding will be channelled towards achieving the intended policy objective of improved pay and conditions. Core Funding is therefore largely contingent on the details of an ERO being agreed.<\/p>  <p>  However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. If an ERO is agreed, where services are already paying above the ERO rate there will not be a requirement to increase rates of pay. Improved terms and conditions, opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, I also launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028.\u00a0Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nurturing Skills commits to the provision of\u00a0part-funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for Early Years Educators working in the sector. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed.\u00a0This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will shortly appoint a consultant to undertake a 12 month review of ECCE which will consider any enhancements that can be made based on international evidence and experience to date. The review will involve a wide consultation with\u00a0providers, educators, parents, children and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the correspondence detailed,\u00a0such as\u00a0the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, detailed information relating to Core Funding is now available at\u00a0first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/core-funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY06900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Admissions","counter":1396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY06800"},{"type":"question","counter":1397,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[22833\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY06900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if dates have been set for the publication for the first round of CAO offers.","asker":"1549","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1398,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000084#WRY07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":1400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000085#WRZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1401,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[22622\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000085#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if persons who undertook undergraduate study without access to free fees that is, in a private college will be given the opportunity to access free fees in another degree course undergraduate entry in cases in which a career change became necessary.","asker":"1549","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1402,"content":"<p>Under\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students exclusive of the student contribution.

The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Student Grant Scheme also makes provision for combining periods of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit and other eligible payments for the purposes of meeting the 391 days eligibility requirement for the special rate of grant. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances includes no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Since September 2021, students\u00a0have not been eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment , in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.<\/p>  <p>  Any student who believes his\/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.<\/p>  <p>  On Wednesday 11 May 2022 at 1pm, the Student Grant Scheme Office will provide a virtual briefing for all Oireachtas members.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000085#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":1409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000085#WRZ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1410,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[22757\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000085#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the issue in relation to Solas apprenticeships (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1411,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to\u00a0SOLAS apprenticeships (details supplied) is being collated by SOLAS.

The programme provides students with a safe environment to better understand appropriate social interactions and to identify unacceptable behaviour, ensuring an understanding of the importance and meaning of consent, but also more broadly, personal assertiveness and social responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  Since the expansion of its remit in August 2020, the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion has worked with the Programme to ensure the national roll-out of this training. National reporting on the Framework for Consent in Irish HEIs in November 2021 showed that a majority of HEIs had engaged with the programme and were offering or intended to offer this training. This year the HEA will support a project that will make the online programme available to all publicly funded higher education institutions on a pilot basis. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, funding of &euro;11,996 was awarded by the Irish Research Council under Strand 1a for the intervention at second level - educating and empowering our young people to speak up and demand a zero tolerance approach to all forms of sexual harassment and violence. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000085#WRZ06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":1469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1470,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[23196\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide details of contracts awarded in 2022 by his Department or bodies under his aegis outside the standard procurement process in order to assist the arrival of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1471,"content":"<p>My Department and the bodies under its aegis have not awarded any contracts outside the standard procurement process to assist with the arrival of displaced persons arriving from the Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1473,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[23225\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department employ persons or firms to deal with public relations; if so, the number of persons employed by his Department to deal with public relations; the names of firms involved; and the total amount spent on public relations by his Department.","asker":"1504","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1474,"content":"<p>The Department does not employ any external person or firm to deal with public relations. <\/p><p>There has not been any spending by the Department on public relations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1476,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[23347\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000086#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the academic or budgetary year the &euro;307 million corresponds to given that reports indicate the economic evaluation of the Cassells report has outlined an annual funding gap of &euro;307 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1477,"content":"<p>It is\u00a0my Department's policy intention that, over a number of years, additional annual\u00a0core funding of &euro;307million will be prioritised through the Estimates process in order to deliver on the increased level of funding identified in this framework, while taking account of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary and fiscal stance.\u00a0 It should be noted that the annual budgetary\u00a0figure of &euro;307 million does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.<\/p><p>The Increasing the Sustainability of Higher and Further Education in Ireland report, based on 2018\/19 data, indicated that &euro;317m of additional funding would be needed per student cohort to reinstate a sustainable level of core funding to the higher education sector.

As Minister, I have no role in these matters.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the prevention and investigation of cybercrime is a priority for the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Since 2016 the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately &euro;500m, or 33%. These funds provide for continued investment in the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB), with ongoing expansion of the Bureau.<\/p><p>The Bureau is the national Garda unit tasked with the forensic examination of computer media seized during the course of any criminal investigations. These include murders, cybercrime, online harassment, computer intrusions, child exploitation offences and any criminal investigation in which computers are seized or may contain evidential data. The unit also conducts investigations into cyber-dependent crimes which are significant or complex in nature, network intrusions, data interference and attacks on websites belonging to Government departments, institutions and corporate entities.<\/p><p>The Bureau is part of Organised and Serious Crime, and is staffed by civilian personnel and Garda members of various ranks up to Detective Superintendent. Members of the unit undergo intensive training in the area of forensic computing and cybercrime investigations, and give expert witness testimony in all types of investigations and prosecutions in court. In addition to its forensic and investigative role, GNCCB acts as a liaison with various partner agencies and law enforcement bodies.<\/p><p>The expansion of the GNCCB is a priority project under <i>A Policing Service for our Future<\/i>, the implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. The aim of this project is to significantly enhance the capabilities of GNCCB to tackle cybercrime in this jurisdiction, including the establishment of six GNCCB Cyber Satellite hubs strategically located throughout the country.<\/p><p>I am pleased to note that Cyber Satellite hubs have recently been established in Cork, Galway, Mullingar and Wexford.

This Group, whose membership consisted of senior officials from the Departments of DCEDIY, Social Protection, Housing, Further and Higher Education, Health, and the Health Service Executive, has now completed its work and the draft Action Plan is currently being finalised for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;105 million is being provided for new disability measures this year under Budget 2022. These measures will include 120,000 additional hours of Personal Assistance supports.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 National Service Plan outlines the HSE's commitment to deliver 1.7m hours of Personal Assistance hours to 2,587 people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":1633,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[23132\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of increasing personal assistant hours by 10%, 15%, and 20% in 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1634,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":1636,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[23133\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in receipt of personal assistant hours in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1637,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":1639,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[23134\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of increasing the number of persons in receipt of personal assistant hours by 10%, 15%, and 20% in 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1640,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[22554\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000088#WRCC04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kerry will continue as a patient on the list of a consultant for future treatments if that person takes an offer of treatment under the national treatment purchase scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient\/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant\/specialist at an outpatient clinic.<\/p>  <p>  The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first.

The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years.\u00a06846 pharmacists are currently\u00a0registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law.<\/p><p>Pharmacy technicians are employed and play an important role in many pharmacies, supporting the operation of the pharmacy and the work of pharmacists, and make a valuable contribution to pharmacy service delivery. In Ireland, however, there is no definition of &ldquo;pharmacy technician&rdquo; in legislation, and technicians are not subject to a statutory professional regulatory regime, nor is the qualification standardised across the various providers of pharmacy technician education and training.<\/p><p>I understand that currently there are reports to the PSI of a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy, and indicate that this is being driven in part by an increasing number of pharmacists choosing to work in a locum capacity.\u00a0This has a knock-on impact on pharmacist vacancies, and potentially on continuity and consistency of service. The PSI has been liaising with<b><\/b>stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support in efforts in understanding and addressing the issue in the short term, the results of which are pending. I understand that the IPU are seeking to establish a stakeholder group to examine the issue.<\/p><p>The PSI is currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The European commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project.

The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, any inputs provided by the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.<\/p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient populations and unmet clinical need. The overriding factor in medicines, including orphan medicines, making it through the process to reimbursement is the availability of Exchequer resources.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and 19 of the 52 new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals.<\/p>  <p>  The pipeline of new medicines coming to market remains strong and this government wants to secure fast access to medicines for the most vulnerable of our patients, including those for the treatment of rare diseases. The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan new medicines this year.<\/p>  <p>  To date in 2022, 24 approvals for reimbursement have been progressed by the HSE. There are a further 125 applications for reimbursement of new medicines in process with the HSE. A number of the medicines undergoing assessment currently have orphan designation and the HSE anticipates that a number of medicines with orphan status may be approved throughout 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) is the European Medicine Agency&rsquo;s committee responsible for recommending orphan designation of medicines for rare diseases. The European Commission decides whether to grant an orphan designation for the medicine based on the COMP's opinion. The HSE does not maintain a register of which medicines are designated orphan drugs, as the orphan status for a drug is subject to change at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000089#WRDD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1701,"content":"<p>Question No. 690 answered with Question No. 689.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000089#WRDD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1703,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[22668\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000089#WRDD03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied); if the appointment will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1704,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000089#WRDD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1705,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000089#WRDD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1706,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[22669\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000089#WRDD03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when HSE workers who did not receive the &euro;1,000 payment by the end of April 2022 will receive the payment (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1707,"content":"<p>On 19th April, the HSE published additional details on this payment, including full eligibility criteria, particulars, and terms and conditions that apply to HSE and Section 38 organisations' employees.

In practice this means that Government approval must be sought for the signature, ratification or approval of every international agreement.<\/p>  <p>  As the proposed instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is currently in the very early stages of negotiation, it is not possible at this time to determine the precise legal ramifications of the instrument, nor has it been determined what form the instrument shall take.<\/p>  <p>  The requirements of the Irish Constitution will, of course, be respected in Ireland&rsquo;s position towards the negotiations and my Department will engage with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to any concerns that may arise in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1803,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1804,"qnumday":723,"qnumall":"[22744\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter in relation to a contract for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1805,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":1806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1807,"qnumday":724,"qnumall":"[22760\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1565 of 26 April 2022, his views on whether that losing a medical card will disincentivise applicants to the fair deal scheme from renting out their principal residence after they have entered long-term residential care (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1808,"content":"<p>The Government has approved a policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme &ldquo;Fair Deal&rdquo;, to incentivise applicants to the Scheme to rent out their principal residence after they have entered long term residential care. The rate of assessment for rental properties will be reduced from 80% to 40% for income from all principal residences. <\/p>  <p>  This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing For All Action 19.8. It is expected that legislation will be brought forward in the coming months. The change will be made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage&rsquo;s Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine how the financial consequences of property rental will impact individual cases as each situation is different. Medical card eligibility notwithstanding, people aged 70 or older are automatically eligible for a GP visit card regardless of income, while the financial burden of continuing health care can be mitigated by other schemes such as the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) and the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI). In certain circumstances a person may also retain entitlement to a discretionary medical card. Please note under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. \u00a0Nursing home residents and their representatives will need to carefully consider their personal circumstances and the potential consequences of their decisions in this regard and it is advisable to make an informed decision before making a commitment to rent their property. <\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that Fair Deal participants are under no obligation to make their homes available for rental if they do not wish to do so. However, if income were derived from any rental agreement, it would be necessary to notify the HSE in order to re-evaluate the relevant person's financial assessment and entitlement to a medical card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE06100"},{"type":"question","counter":1810,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[22761\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000090#WREE06200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the general practitioners who have been assigned to Ukrainian refugees in County Roscommon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1811,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people fleeing the war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland as part of the EU response and such it is providing the necessary supports to those who have arrived here, as well as the large numbers of further people expected to arrive.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Department and the HSE to ensure that Ukrainians arriving to Ireland are provided with appropriate health and social care services including primary health care services for adults, children and older people, ongoing care of priority medical conditions and vaccination services including for COVID-19 and childhood immunisations.

The OEST has an initial staffing requirement of 4 Whole-time Equivalents (WTEs) including a Clinical Director, Midwife and case managers. Funding of &euro;540,000 was provided to support the establishment and expansion of the OEST from Budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the OEST is to support the networks as they respond to the events in terms of overseeing and advising on appointment of the review panel, family engagement, conduct of the review, finalisation of the review report and follow up. In addition to assisting the health services in responding to severe maternity related incidents and in the provision of appropriate supports for patients and families, the OEST aims to ensure appropriate expert level support is available nationally by enabling learning from adverse maternity incidents to be actioned at a national level and by promoting engagement with relevant stakeholders across the maternity network. It is anticipated that this will lead to safer and improved high-quality of care for patients and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000093#WRHH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Media","counter":1914,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000093#WRHH03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1915,"qnumday":762,"qnumall":"[23051\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000093#WRHH03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the percentage of social media posts made on each of his Departmental social media accounts or the social media accounts of public bodies and agencies that operate under his remit that were exclusively in Irish between 1 May 2021 and 30 April 2022, inclusive;

service. 'Your Service, Your Say' is available to anyone accessing HSE mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Following the investigation of the complaint by the HSE, an individual may request an internal review to be carried out by the HSE if they are not happy with the outcome. Furthermore, in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, they can request an external review from the Office of the Ombudsman, or in the case of child and adolescent services, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. This option is available to anyone who accesses our public health services, be it mental health services or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, published in July 2021, provides for every person accessing treatment in an inpatient mental health facility to be given information about their care and treatment, including an explicit requirement to provide information on the service&rsquo;s complaints procedure. Furthermore, the powers of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are being expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and community mental health services. As under the existing Act, the Inspector will continue to meet with any person accessing mental health services who has requested such a meeting.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme also includes a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Sections 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The improvement of Advocacy supports is a key objective of the HSE Service Plan 2022.There are a number of advocacy supports for people accessing mental health services\u00a0offered by the public and voluntary sectors. The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports such as a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services has a pilot scheme in place in two inpatient units to provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).<\/p>  <p>  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs.\u00a0NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. Citizens Information Centres can be found nationwide and provide free, impartial advice and advocacy, or the Citizens Information Phone Service can be reached by phone.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions.

However, we have seen a recovery in the figures since that time:<\/p><p>- the total number of GP e-referrals to cancer Rapid Access Clinics for 2021 stood at 130% of the activity for the corresponding period in 2019; <\/p><p>- the total number of patients seen across all Rapid Access Clinics in 2021 stands at 102% of the corresponding period in 2019; and <\/p><p>- the number of patients receiving chemotherapy in 2021 was at 100% of 2019 activity;  <\/p><p>- the number of patients receiving radiation oncology in 2021 was at 89% of 2019 activity; and <\/p><p>- the number undergoing surgical oncology in 2021 was at 90%.  <\/p><p>The Government has provided significant extra funding for cancer services in Ireland. Funding of &euro;5m has been provided in 2022 to continue the work of supporting cancer services and increasing capacity in the context of Covid-19. This is in addition to the &euro;12m allocated in 2021. This funding is facilitating additional clinics and the extension of clinic times, as well as allowing for minor infrastructural works to be carried out and for locum and temporary staff to be recruited to support the delivery of services. <\/p><p>In addition, there has been significant investment over the last two years for implementation of the National Cancer Strategy, with &euro;20m provided in 2021 and a further &euro;20m in 2022. This funding is being utilised to advance the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and to provide continued support for patients living with and beyond cancer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":2017,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2018,"qnumday":800,"qnumall":"[23274\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the co-ordinated work that is being undertaken at a European Union level to facilitate registration of Ukrainian medical professionals in European Union countries under the auspices of the current situation in Ukraine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2019,"content":"<p>The EU Commission has been actively engaged in co-ordinating efforts to facilitate the recognition of Ukrainian professional qualifications, including the qualifications of medical professionals.

In order to protect patients, it has a responsibility to ensure that all doctors registered to practise medicine in Ireland are safe to do so and meet the requirements to practise as set out in legislation.Officials from my Department have been in regular contact with the Council to examine the ways in which support can be provided to doctors arriving from Ukraine and to ensure that practitioners can be assisted and facilitated in gaining registration where possible. The Council is working with a range of stakeholders in this regard including the HSE, Postgraduate Training Bodies and the Irish Medical Schools Council. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE, through the National Doctors Training &amp;amp; Planning Unit (NDTP), in partnership with the Council and the Postgraduate Training Bodies, is coordinating an information gathering process which is collating information about healthcare professionals who are coming to Ireland. This data collection process is ongoing and will assist the relevant bodies in supporting these doctors and enable them to contact the individual doctors directly. The HSE is also looking at other options which these doctors can avail of while registration is pending, such as medical translation and access to CPD resources. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that practitioners seeking registration face significant fees and for refugees arriving from Ukraine it may be particularly challenging to meet these costs. This is an issue which is being actively considered by my Department, the Medical Council and the other health profession regulators all of whom recognise the need to provide support to applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The selection of examinations for establishing medical education standards is a matter for the Medical Council. I have been advised that when the Medical Council determined the international exams suitable for the purpose of PRES Level 2 (UK, USA, Australia and Canada), there were a number of considerations including the similarities in the nature of medical education in those countries to that of Ireland.  These are seen as the best fit in determining the suitability for registration of a candidate who has not qualified here.  The Council has advised that acceptance of the Krok exam, which would enable access to the General Division of the register, would in effect be without any overall assessment of medical education in Ukraine.  This could seriously undermine the Council&rsquo;s ability to fulfil its patient safety remit. These are challenges which other EU Member States are also attempting to address. Officials from my Department form part of a coordination group established by the European Commission to examine the registration of Ukrainian health and social care professionals arriving in EU States as a result of the conflict. This group shares knowledge and best practice and is examining methods to streamline and expedite registration for these professionals, including the use of electronic databases, the EU information centres for academic recognition and machine translation tools.<\/p>  <p>  Registration in the Supervised Division is granted to doctors who have been offered a post that has been approved by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which has specific supervisory arrangements. The Council cannot grant registration in the Supervised Division until the HSE has confirmed there is a publicly funded post available. The information currently available indicates that the Supervised Division is not the optimum route at this time. I fully appreciate the importance of facilitating access to employment for doctors arriving to Ireland. My Department, along with the Medical Council and the HSE will continue to ensure that all avenues are being explored with a view to enabling Ukrainian qualified doctors to apply for registration, always conscious of the need to ensure that patient safety, is to the fore of any decisions regarding registration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2025,"content":"<p>Question No. 802 answered with Question No. 801.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2026,"content":"<p>Question No. 803 answered with Question No. 801.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2027,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2028,"qnumday":804,"qnumall":"[23291\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of women in adult psychiatric units by CHO area since January 2021 to date, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2029,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2030,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2031,"qnumday":805,"qnumall":"[23294\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000096#WRLL02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will clarify the regulations in relation to non-surgical cosmetic treatments aesthetics; if his attention has been drawn to the proliferation of unregulated practices in the administration of these cosmetic procedures; the steps that he plans to take to regulate same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2032,"content":"<p>The manufacture and placing on the market of dermal fillers is regulated under Regulation (EU) 2017\/745 (&ldquo;MDR&rdquo;.) The MDR, which became fully applicable in May 2021, has an expanded scope, and will specifically include all dermal fillers, including those without a medical purpose, within its scope once the technical requirements (known as common specifications) for these products are in place. Once the common specifications are adopted, all dermal fillers will need to be certified as medical devices under the MDR and undergo a premarket assessment by an independent conformity assessment body (a Notified Body) before they can be CE marked and placed on the market.

For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.<\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise.

This figure increased again in 2021 with a total of 809 appeals received.
