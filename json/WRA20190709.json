The Commission's review process will include: an evaluation study, which will conclude in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation process, which will conclude on 17 July 2019; and targeted consultation with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders, to commence in the coming months.

In 2019, the Irish Exchequer will provide\u00a0just over\u00a0&euro;300m in subvention for public service obligation (PSO) transport services and Rural Transport Local Link services.\u00a0 The Deputy is suggesting an idea of abolishing\u00a0fares.\u00a0 One of the factors to take into account is that the amount collected from fares is approximately &euro;600 million annually.\u00a0 This means that the rough cost to the taxpayer of eliminating fares would be in the region of &euro;600 million more every year - in addition to the amounts already spent on PSO and on capital investment.\u00a0 And this amount would only enable\u00a0continuation of the existing level\u00a0of service and passengers, without factoring in the costs of catering for increased passenger travel demand.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in focussing on the need to reduce private car emissions and also to stimulate and support increased uptake of public transport.\u00a0 That is exactly the Government's approach as set out in our recent Climate Plan.\u00a0 According to 2017 emission estimates:  <\/p>  <p>  - Around 52% of transport emissions come from private car use;  <\/p>  <p>  - Just over 18% comes from the freight sector; and <\/p>  <p>  - Around 4.4% of emissions come from the public transport fleet.<\/p>  <p>  As such, it is clear that inroads must be made in reducing the dominance of the private car in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector.<\/p>  <p>  Modal shift from the private car to sustainable means of transport remains central to the transport sector&rsquo;s response to climate change.\u00a0 Investment in public transport led to an increase of almost 58 million journeys on subsidised public transport and commercial bus service since 2012.\u00a0 Last year\u00a0we saw an increase of\u00a016.3 million passenger journeys provided by Dublin Bus, Bus\u00a0&Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Luas and Go-Ahead Ireland on PSO services.\u00a0\u00a0That is an increase of\u00a0over 6.5%\u00a0compared to 2017.\u00a0 I think the Deputies would agree that this increase in passenger growth is very positive.\u00a0 The growth in public transport services has been supported by higher levels of subvention in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and as I mentioned earlier it was increased again this year to provide a total allocation of over &euro;300m.<\/p>  <p>  In order to reduce the prevalence of the private car and encourage a shift to more sustainable forms of transport, a number of key policy measures to increase public transport capacity will be progressed over the next decade.\u00a0 The National Development Plan has earmarked &euro;8.6 billion for investment in public and sustainable transport to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of bus services in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years for both PSO and Local Link services in rural areas. The increased funding has enabled the introduction of new commuter services into the Local Link network, including new evening services. Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages. The NTA is also developing two pilot schemes for implementation this year for both a Local Area Hackney and a Community Transport Service, to be administered locally by the existing network of Local Link offices throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900064#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&aacute;ilte Ireland Funding","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900064#WRA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[29570\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900064#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the new capital fund of F&aacute;ilte Ireland;

The Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption.<\/p>  <p>  The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, plays a key role in the national decarbonisation effort. It is worth noting that transport emissions are classified under both the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS)\u00a0and non-ETS systems. Generally, non-domestic emissions such as those from international aviation within Europe\u00a0are accounted for under the ETS\u00a0system while domestic transport emissions fall under\u00a0the non-ETS system. The Climate Action Plan deals primarily with the non-ETS sector, where Ireland has a legal binding emissions reduction target\u00a0of 20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels).\u00a0 Accordingly, the focus of the transport elements of the Plan relate mainly to reducing land transport emissions and not those generated by international travel and in-coming tourists. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions for inclusion in the Climate Action Plan, particularly in relation to public transport and active travel.\u00a0 A critical challenge is reducing the 52% of transport emissions that come from private car use.\u00a0 Our aim in\u00a0expanding the carrying capacity and the attractiveness of our public transport and active travel networks is\u00a0to provide a viable sustainable alternative to private car use for more people for more of their journeys.\u00a0Under Project Ireland 2040, an indicative allocation of &euro;8.6 billion is assigned to support sustainable mobility ensuring that public transport and active travel become more\u00a0available and attractive\u00a0alternatives. <\/p>  <p>  A switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key mitigation measure\u00a0of\u00a0the Plan, with a target of almost 950,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2030. While this level of transition is incredibly challenging, as technologies improve and become cheaper, and if we continue incentives and invest in the recharging network we are ambitious that with a real push we can make real progress towards this target by 2030. Concerted efforts across several Departments will be essential if we are to maintain a supportive environment to assist citizens in making the greener choice and switching to an EV. My Department and I will work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the roadmap that will be necessary to achieve our\u00a0collective ambition.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of tourism, while there are no specific actions in the Plan, climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. Urban tourism may be less affected than coastal tourism where sea level rise, increasing ocean acidification and coastal erosion can threaten Ireland&rsquo;s coastal tourism infrastructure and natural attractions. It is difficult to predict possible changes to Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination as a result of climate change and the impact of this on the economic value of tourism in Ireland and tourism demand. Destination attractions such as Skellig Michael and the Burren could be especially vulnerable; therefore the role of the tourism sector in adaptation planning is extremely important. <\/p>  <p>  The range of implications of climate change on the transport, tourism, and even sport sectors means that I and my Department is fully committed to achieving the climate change objectives set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and I hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall as they did in 2018. Indeed, every sector must\u00a0step-up if Ireland is to meet our emission reduction targets in 2030 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900064#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ports Policy","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900064#WRA04200"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[29110\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900064#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason it is more appropriate for responsibility for Galway Port to transfer to the local authority rather than its present structure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>Galway Harbour Company, as a Port of Regional Significance, is designated under National Ports Policy 2013 to transfer to local authority control.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer process has been on-going for a number of years and the due diligence process is moving towards completion.<\/p>  <p>  National Ports Policy recognises that the five Ports of Regional Significance, which collectively represent less than 4% of total market share, retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities.

In this way\u00a0we\u00a0will\u00a0lower climate-harmful\u00a0emissions, begin to tackle congestion and see an improvement in local air quality. <\/p>  <p>  This Plan\u00a0includes our commitment to deliver an additional half a million public transport and active travel journeys daily by 2035. This is a significant step up in our ambition and requires expanding the capacity and attractiveness of our walking and cycling networks as well as our public transport system.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040,\u00a0we have assigned\u00a0&euro;8.6 billion to support sustainable mobility.\u00a0In addition\u00a0to support for key public transport projects this investment\u00a0will vastly improve the cycling and walking infrastructure in all our major cities. In fact,\u00a0this &euro;8.6 billion investment budget is well above what we will be investing in new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment in the past.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2018-2021:  <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;110 million\u00a0will\u00a0be specifically\u00a0dedicated\u00a0\u00a0to cycling and walking\u00a0infrastructure in our\u00a0major urban areas; <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;750 million\u00a0is earmarked for the BusConnects\u00a0programme in Dublin to include the\u00a0delivery of around\u00a0200 kilometres of segregated cycling\u00a0lanes; and <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;53 million\u00a0will be used to support the development of new Greenways.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0will support\u00a0the increasing numbers of people who choose cycling as their preferred mode of transport, including\u00a0E-bikes\u00a0users.\u00a0\u00a0It is clear that prioritising investment in our cycling network is already working; the number of annual cycling trips is increasing, particularly within the Greater Dublin Area with surveys such as the Canal Cordon Count showing cycling numbers almost doubling between 2011 and 2018. <\/p>  <p>  We need to build on this and do even more.\u00a0Key actions under the Climate\u00a0Plan\u00a0underpin this commitment\u00a0to increasing cycling as a mode of travel, including the establishment of a Cycling Project Office within the National Transport Authority and the development of implementation plans and increased cycling infrastructure for Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The Cycling Project Office will ensure that the new cycling infrastructure is delivered optimally, in line with the significantly increased funding that is being provided. <\/p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work Scheme also\u00a0continues to\u00a0encourage the use of bicycles and e-bikes to travel to and from work. Under the scheme an eligible employer can buy a bicycle for their employees and the employee pays\u00a0the amount, less\u00a0the tax relief,\u00a0over up to 12 months through a salary sacrifice arrangement. Up to &euro;1,000 can be provided for towards the purchase of a new bicycle or e-Bike which is a generous contribution towards any commuter bicycle, but especially towards an e-bike which are generally more expensive. <\/p>  <p>  The climate challenge needed a step-up in ambition and a renewed determination across Government and society to tackle climate disruption - the Climate Action Plan has given us this required level of focus and drive.\u00a0I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and I hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall as they did in 2018. Cycling\u00a0will play an important\u00a0role\u00a0 in this decarbonisation effort and I am dedicated to investing and improving our cycling network. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[29512\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the costings to build and run a national transport training centre; if due diligence and correct procurement procedure has been followed; the procurement procedure that took place; and the documentation and public notice in relation to same.","asker":"1306","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[29513\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the level of consultation that has taken place with the wider disability community further to the announcement on 26 June 2019 that the National Transport Authority is to provide funding for the development of a national transport training centre by an organisation (details supplied); and the details of the consultation.","asker":"1306","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[29531\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the future for the training centres in Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and a company (details supplied) in view of the fact that Dublin Bus already trains persons with disabilities to use all public transport.

A proposal for a\u00a0new Regulation of the\u00a0Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2021 &ndash;2027 was published by the European Commission in May 2018.\u00a0Ireland has advocated at EU level for projects on our comprehensive network to continue to be eligible for co-funding during the period 2021 - 2027.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction\u00a0with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, calling for projects on the comprehensive network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State to be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, including the rail network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant calls for proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenways Development","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[29499\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress of the roll out of the Bearna greenway for Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport and active travel.

It is the Government&rsquo;s job to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making the greener choice and selecting electric vehicles now and in the years to come.<\/p>  <p>  To that end, an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, \u00a0co-charied\u00a0by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment (DCCAE), was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate\u00a0EV take-up. Preliminary recommendations from the Taskforce were considered ahead of Budgets 2018 and 2019 and a suite of continued and new EV supports were subsequently announced. Principal supports, such as the EV Purchase Grant Scheme, the Domestic Charger Grant and the roll out of an extensive recharging network, fall under the remit of the Minister of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment. In tandem, I am responsible for two further initiatives: the Electric Vehicle Toll Incentive (EVTI) Scheme and the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The EVTI was designed to encourage private car commuters who regularly use tolled roads to consider switching to an EV. It is estimated that there are approximately 400,000 heavy toll users in Ireland so reduced tolls act as a meaningful incentive for a large number of vehicle owners. I\u00a0have committed to continuing this incentive until 2022 or\u00a0until\u00a0a threshold of 50,000 registrations has been reached. <\/p>  <p>  The eSPSV Grant Scheme promotes the use of EVs in\u00a0taxis\/hackneys\/limousines. Recognising the important role that the SPSV sector can play in demonstrating EV technology to a wider audience I have agreed, under the Climate Action Plan,\u00a0to\u00a0improve the value of the eSPSV grant to those transitioning to wheelchair accessible electric SPSVs to make EVs available to a\u00a0greater number of our\u00a0citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, support from the Department of Finance has also been fundamental in establishing the current positive policy environment under which we have already seen electric vehicle sales rise steeply over the past year, albeit from a low base. According to the latest figures, approximately 11,500 EVs were under taxation at the end of May 2019. This is double the amount that was on Irish roads at the end of May 2018. In order to continue this trajectory I will continue to work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the new policy pathway that will be necessary to ensure that Ireland\u00a0is well positioned to avail fully of increased supply of EVs, of improved technology and falling prices that are expected worldwide. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Regulations","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[22794\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the discussions he has had regarding the relaunch of the local area hackney scheme; the specific proposals planned to simplify the application process; his plans in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. <\/p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.

Accordingly, converting our public transport fleets to lower-carbon alternatives including electricity will have a limited, though positive, impact on reducing national CO2   emissions. That said, I believe that moving to low-emission alternatives for public transport is important so as to promote and normalise the use of non-conventional lower-emitting fuels and technologies. <\/p>  <p>  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory to low-emission buses has been outlined. We are committed in Project Ireland 2040 to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from this month. In preparation for both this immediate transition and the development of a longer-term low-carbon bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the National Transport Authority (NTA), Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials which are expected to conclude in the coming weeks. Under the BusConnects Programme it is expected that approximately half of the public urban bus fleet will have moved to lower-emitting alternatives by 2023 with full conversion by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has recently initiated a tender competition to award a &ldquo;Framework Agreement for the Supply of Double-Deck Diesel-Electric Hybrid Buses&rdquo;\u00a0with the\u00a0number of vehicles to be purchased being decided on an annual basis in line with replacement requirements, capacity needs and funding availability, in addition to taking into account developments in other vehicle technologies.<\/p>  <p>  Electrifying key, heavily used elements of the rail network must also be considered if the transport\u00a0sector is to achieve its decarbonisation objectives. We plan to create a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area, which\u00a0is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year. It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks. The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recently commenced a procurement process for the establishment of a 10-year framework agreement for the purchase of additional lower-emitting rail fleet required for the expansion of the DART network. These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low-carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact our sectoral emissions profile. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in the small public service vehicle (SPSV) or taxi sector, the Electric SPSV Grant Scheme opened to applicants in February 2018 and provides purchase reliefs of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The Scheme was continued into 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy\u00a0that a comprehensive programme of work is well underway to reduce the public transport sector&rsquo;s carbon footprint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06000"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[29581\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the issuing of a permit to an airline (details supplied) to operate a service between Dublin and Madrid under the fifth freedom; his views on whether this provides the airline with an unfair competitive advantage over domestic and European airlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[29226\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which he will ensure that the recent fifth freedom agreement with an airline (details supplied) protects competition and consumers here.","asker":"1346","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[29227\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on whether the recent fifth freedom agreement signed with an airline (details supplied) will undermine or threaten EU airlines operating here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[29454\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason for the recent granting of a fifth freedom permit to an airline (details supplied) to operate a service between Dublin and Madrid in view of the fact that the Dublin to Madrid route is already served by three EU airlines that are cumulatively providing over 39 services per week; his views on whether the granting of routes under the fifth freedom is commercially damaging to domestic airlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[29755\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason for recent decision to grant fifth freedom rights to an airline (details supplied) to operate commercial flights from Dublin to Madrid; if unions that represent workers in the aviation industry were consulted regarding the change; if not, the reason; his views on whether unions in cases of this nature should be consulted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[29763\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900065#WRB06600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on whether the granting of a fifth freedom licence to an airline (details supplied) to operate a Dublin to Madrid service will place EU based airlines at a competitive disadvantage; the reason for issuing the licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 613, 614, 624, 656 and 657 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Ireland - Ethiopia Bilateral Air Services Agreement, signed in 2014, allows for the granting of fifth freedom air\u00a0traffic rights for airlines\u00a0of both countries, on a reciprocal basis and subject to the approval of the relevant aeronautical authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Ethiopian Airlines applied to both the Spanish and Irish Aeronautical Authorities in 2018 for approval of their Addis Ababa - Madrid - Dublin (return)\u00a0route.

Today, 9 June, Ireland delivered a national statement on Sudan at the Human Rights Council in Geneva calling for all human rights violations and abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence, to be thoroughly investigated in an independent and transparent manner with those responsible held to account.<\/p>  <p>  Senior officials from my Department met the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year to express concerns at the political situation.\u00a0 My Department's ongoing communication with the Embassy on the evolving situation in Sudan allows our concerns to be formally transmitted to the Sudanese authorities.\u00a0 Officials also recently met with representatives of the Sudanese community in Ireland to listen to their concerns and views regarding how the current impasse may be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;29 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan. As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed to humanitarian support in Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and provided financing of &euro;3 million in 2019. In 2018, the fund provided assistance to just under 2 million beneficiaries, including 489,556 girls and 609,162 women. Programmes funded by the Sudan Humanitarian Fund include Gender-Based Violence programming and supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900066#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900066#WRC05800"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[29155\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900066#WRC05900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland and-or the European Union has expressed concern over the treatment of the LGBTQI community in Turkey; his views on the banning of pride parades nationally and the use of tear gas by police on participants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>The Commission&rsquo;s 2019 Enlargement Package report on Turkey noted that there are serious concerns regarding the protection of the fundamental rights of LGBTI persons.

Specific activities included advertisements on social media platforms, print ads, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations.<\/p><p>In Q4 2018 the service was expanded to include online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, a passport card for children and a wider cohort of adults eligible to renew online.  This expanded service means that all Irish citizens can now renew their passports online 24\/7 from anywhere in the world. My Department ran a three-week public information campaign\u00a0including advertisements on social media platforms, print ads and radio ads. The success of this campaign has led to a significant increase in online renewal applications in Q1 2019.<\/p><p>The direct costs of online and social media advertising to raise public awareness amongst Irish citizens in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.<\/p><p>- <b>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council<\/b><\/p><p>On July 2<sup>nd<\/sup>2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online, and the direct costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.<\/p><p>- <b>Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;<\/b><\/p><p>The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign have formed part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep citizens fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit.<\/p><p>The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies.\u00a0This service has a global reach with 37.7% of the subscribers of the service coming from outside of Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department also coordinated a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.\u00a0 This campaign updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as on public workshop events that were held over successive weeks throughout October and the last two weeks in November. A programme of awareness raising via online and social media platforms also took place.\u00a0 Costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.<\/p><p>- <b>St Patrick&rsquo;s Day<\/b><\/p><p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a unique opportunity to engage with the global Irish community and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests overseas, with levels of publicity and media attention unmatched by the National Day of any other country.<\/p><p>This year&rsquo;s programme had the largest number of countries ever visited for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. The Taoiseach and I, along with 13 Ministers, 19 Ministers of State, the Attorney General, Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach visited 56 countries across\u00a0Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific region.\u00a0\u00a0These programmes allowed us to promote trade, investment and tourism with Ireland, to increase visibility in new markets, and to promote our values and our influence in global institutions, notably in support of our campaign to become a member of the United Nations Security Council.\u00a0 It also allowed us to deepen our connections with Irish people and friends of Ireland all over the world.<\/p><p>Team Ireland overseas delivered a total of 1,796 events in support of Ireland&rsquo;s interest over the 2019 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in this context.  To coincide with and complement these activities, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to online promotion of an accompanying St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day video as outlined in Table 1 below. In addition to Ireland, the video in question was also promoted in certain areas of the USA and continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) to audiences with strong Irish diaspora connections and\/or related potential disposition to Ireland as a tourism destination.<\/p><p>- <b>Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025<\/b><\/p><p>&lsquo;Global Ireland&rsquo; is an all-of-Government programme which aims to double Ireland&rsquo;s impact in the world by 2025. The programme was launched by the Taoiseach and myself and Ministers Humphreys, Madigan and McEntee in June 2018 and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions in relation to how we trade, the bilateral and multilateral partnerships that we seek to build and our wider contribution to the world.<\/p><p>Global Ireland: Ireland's Strategy for the US and Canada 2019&ndash;2025 is Ireland's first whole-of-Government strategy for the US and Canada. Its aim is for Ireland to build strong, strategic political partnerships with the US and Canada and assume a lead role in building stronger transatlantic relations.<\/p><p>To coincide with the programme of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day-related activities held there earlier this year, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to the online promotion of a video that outlined the Strategy&rsquo;s key objectives insofar as the US is concerned.\u00a0 In addition to Ireland, the video in question was also promoted in the various areas of the US where Irish diplomatic missions are located &ndash; viz., Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Washington D.C. &ndash; so as to support and facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with key audiences in each case.<\/p><p>- <b>Travelwise<\/b><\/p><p>TravelWise is an award-winning smartphone app designed to help Irish citizens to stay safe and informed while travelling, living or working overseas.<\/p><p>A core part of our mission is to help ensure the safety and welfare of Irish people travelling abroad by providing accessible and relevant information. There are increasing numbers of Irish residents travelling abroad &ndash; more than 7 million trips abroad &ndash; and increasing numbers travelling to higher-risk locations.<\/p><p>TravelWise has been developed by the Department to provide travel advice and consular information to these citizens to keep them informed and aware. To coincide with its launch in 2016 my Department spent a small amount to promote its uptake.<\/p><p>- <b>Other Projects<\/b><\/p><p>My Department has also engaged in social media promotion of certain other initiatives and projects that relate to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy activities.<\/p><p>- Commissioning, in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy, the first public performance at the UN General Assembly of a new work of poetry by Eavan Boland (&ldquo;Our Future Will Become The Past of Other Women&rdquo;) to mark the centenary of women&rsquo;s suffrage in December 2018;<\/p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s participation (by video) in the 2 December 2018 'Global Citizen Mandela 100' concert; and<\/p><p>- A public consultation to help shape Ireland&rsquo;s new diaspora policy is currently taking place around the country, and to encourage public awareness of these events taking place my department has promoted these events on Facebook.<\/p><p>- The launch of Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, on 28 February.<\/p><p>2019<table><tr><th>Campaign Details and dates<\/th><th>Company<\/th><th>Cost<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals\u00a0<\/td><td>PHD (Social media and online)\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;7,127.78<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Getty Ireland Brexit Ready\u00a0<\/td><td>PHD (Twitter, internet and search optimisation)\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;108,787.64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St Patrick's Day\u00a0<\/td><td>PHD (Social media)\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;9,181.60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Simon Cumbers Media Fund &amp;amp; &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;<\/td><td>Facebook &amp;amp; Twitter<\/td><td>&euro;663.25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A New Diapora Policy for Ireland\u00a0<\/td><td>Facebook\u00a0\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;400.02<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;126,160.29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals<\/td><td>Twitter &amp;amp; Facebook\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;1,392.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Getting Ireland Brexit Ready\u00a0\u00a0<\/td><td>PHD (Social media, internet and search optimisation)\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;52,760.41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UN Security Council Campaign\u00a0<\/td><td>PHD (Social media)<\/td><td>&euro;9,641.17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Global Ireland<\/td><td>PHD (social media)\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;5,837.80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/FAT Missions<\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;93.09<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;69,724.47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\/FAT Missions<\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;113.60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals<\/td><td>Facebook &amp;amp; Twitter<\/td><td>&euro;5,821.54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;5,935.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Consular Division - Travelwise\u00a0<\/td><td>Facebook<\/td><td>&euro;4,000.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DFAT Missions\u00a0<\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;3,578.28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;7,578.28<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900066#WRC07800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900066#WRC07900"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[29408\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900066#WRC08000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on reports that Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n is suppressing academic freedom and independent institutions in Hungary; the steps he believes should be taken to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>The European Commission is taking a number of values-related infringements proceedings against Hungary regarding the NGO law and the Higher Education Law\u00a0and its impact on the operation of the Central European University as well as in relation to asylum procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Rule of law issues in Hungary have been discussed at the General Affairs Councils on a number of occasions since Autumn 2018.

Attacks against civilians, including refugees and migrants, are totally unacceptable, and contrary to International Humanitarian Law. On 3 July, I issued a statement condemning the attack, and supporting the calls of the EU and the UN for an investigation into the facts of what may well constitute a war crime. <\/p>  <p>  All EU Member States have condemned in the strongest terms this attack in a statement issued on 5 July. EU Member States welcomed any fact-finding mission undertaken by the UN into the attack, called for an end to fighting in Libya, urged parties to return to the UN led mediation process, and reminded all Libyan parties of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. EU Member States also expressed our readiness to urgently step up collective efforts to address the situation, and in particular, to improve protection and assistance to migrants and refugees. <\/p>  <p>  As I said in my statement last week, this tragic event underlines the fact that the system of detention centres in Libya is completely unsuitable for migrants, and puts them at risk. Ireland and the EU&rsquo;s position is that Libya&rsquo;s system of detaining migrants must end, and that migration must be managed in full compliance with international law. In the meantime, the EU has been working to provide life-saving support to migrants and refugees in detention. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has mobilised &euro;318 million under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa for the protection of migrants, refugees and internally displaced people in Libya, and to provide support to local communities to cope with the migration challenge. Throughout the conflict in Libya, the EU has cooperated with the UNHCR and IOM, which have staff on the ground in Libya, to provide protection and assistance to vulnerable migrants and refugees in detention centres and elsewhere. We have successfully evacuated refugees and migrants from detention centres near the frontline, and, where possible, have enabled them to find safety outside Libya, including in the Emergency Transit Mechanism in Niger, with a view to their resettlement. Through our cooperation with the UN and the African Union, the EU has helped over 45,000 migrants stranded in Libya to return to their countries of origin, and has evacuated close to 4,000 persons in need of international protection. However, many more people remain at risk, and the EU will continue to work with its partners to relocate them to safe places swiftly to receive assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to access all areas where migrants are located, or to influence the situation on the ground. Ultimately, ensuring adequate treatment of migrants and refugees will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning Libyan Government. Ireland and the EU continue to support the efforts of the UN Special Representative, Ghassan Salam&eacute;, to bring this about.  All Libyans, and all international parties, should give their full support to the UN-led political efforts, and parties should ensure that they follow through on commitments made during the talks. This is the only way to ensure that civilians in Libya, including migrants and refugees, are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Administration","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[29631\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the roll-out of online renewal for children&rsquo;s passports since the project commenced in November 2018; the number of online child applications by county since then; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1315","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The award-winning Online Passport Renewal Service was launched in March 2017 and offers the convenience of an online application system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for Irish citizens anywhere in the world.<\/p><p>In November 2018, the Online Passport Renewal Service was expanded to include the online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, to introduce a passport card for children, and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. <\/p><p>Since the  expansion of the  service last year, 71,384 online passport applications for children have been submitted.

There has also been a significant increase in passport applications from applicants in Northern Ireland and in Britain since the UK Referendum on EU membership in June 2016.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken by the Passport Service to manage increases in demand in recent years including the recruitment of additional staff, the continuous implementation of technological and service improvements and the re-organisation of production processes and administrative arrangements.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources, including staffing, are effectively deployed to meet the ongoing anticipated strong demand for Irish passports. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, the Passport Service employed 363 Full Time Equivalent staff. This is an increase of over 40 staff since the same point in 2017. Already this year, over 90 additional Full Time Equivalent staff have taken up roles in the Passport Service. Targeted overtime has been sanctioned for both permanent and temporary staff when required. The Passport Service has received approval to recruit over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) in 2019 to assist in processing passport applications and to deal with queries from the general public. <\/p>  <p>  A new Customer Service Hub was established in January 2019 to ensure that the Passport Service is equipped to deal with the large volume of queries received through its phone and webchat services. The Passport Service is currently handling approximately 5000 calls and 3800 webchats per week. Thanks to this dedicated customer service team, we are able to quickly resolve most queries at the first point of contact. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The award winning Online Passport Renewal Service was introduced in March 2017 and expanded in  November 2018 to allow for the renewal of children's passports and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. <\/p>  <p>  The online service brings significant benefits to citizens with faster turnaround times at a lower cost.  45% of all applications received in 2019 have been online applications and over 60% of those eligible to use the online application channel have done so. The online service has been instrumental in the efficient management of overall passport operations and in allowing the Passport Service to allocate staff resources more efficiently to cope with unprecedented demand. <\/p>  <p>  To assist with forecasting future demand for Irish passports, my Department has commissioned research to better understand the potential demand for passports from Irish citizens in the United Kingdom who have not yet applied for a passport. Interim reports have been provided and in 2019 an additional forecasting report was commissioned which sought to update and revise projected demand estimates up to mid-2023. This research will assist the Passport Service in formulating plans on resource requirements for the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[29526\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has met the newly appointed United States ambassador to Ireland recently; and if so, the issues that were discussed.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The Government and I were pleased to receive confirmation on 27th June last that the new US Ambassador to Ireland, Edward Crawford, had been sworn into his new role by US Vice President Pence.

The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue. Revenue has referenced the original scope of its zero rating concession but acknowledged that the scope had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently concluded a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including health and nutrition experts as well as my colleague the Minister for Health, to ensure that any legislative changes brought forward are evidence based. Officials in my department are considering the submissions received and the outcome will be presented to the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) on 9th July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Staff","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[29144\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons the Revenue Commissioners recruited since January 2019, by grade and county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>Revenue is an integrated tax and customs administration.

Any gain arising on the transfer of the land is liable to CGT for the person making the disposal. The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in a tax year are exempt from CGT. <\/p>  <p>  Relief from CGT is available for a transfer of land by a parent to his or her child to enable the child to build a house on the land provided certain conditions are met. This relief does not apply to transfers between siblings.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer of land where no consideration has been paid for the land, or where any consideration paid was less than its full market value, could result in a gift tax liability for the sibling receiving the gift. For gift tax purposes, the relationship between the person who provides the gift and the person who receives the gift (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the life-time tax-free threshold - known as the Group threshold, below which inheritance tax does not arise. In the case of the gift between siblings, the Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a brother or sister of the disponer.  <\/p>  <p>   Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts which are in excess of their relevant tax-free threshold, gift tax at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.<\/p>  <p>  As the transfer of land constitutes both a disposal for CGT purposes and a gift for gift tax purposes, a credit is given for any CGT paid against a gift tax liability in respect of the same land.<\/p>  <p>  Stamp duty at the rate of 6% of the market value applies on the transfer of land. In this case the duty would be payable by the sibling receiving the land. However, there is a refund scheme in place in respect of the acquisition of land that is then developed for residential purposes.   A refund of up to 2\/3 of the stamp duty paid may be claimed where a house is built on the land and other qualifying conditions for the relief are met.  A fixed timeframe for the commencement and completion of building work applies; construction work must commence within 30 months of the land being transferred and the house must be completed within two years of the commencement of construction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Data","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD06700"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[29392\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900067#WRD06800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount spent on digital marketing in each of the past eight years;

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.  Property rental income and gains arising are exempt from tax within the REIT and are taxed at the investor level when distributed through dividend withholding tax at 20%.  The\u00a0legislation requires that 85% of all rental income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.  The REIT is subject to corporation tax on income and gains not arising from the property rental business of the REIT.\u00a0  Distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds\u00a0and charities do not suffer the withholding tax as they are more generally exempt from tax.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, which derive 25% or more of its market value from assets deriving their value directly or indirectly from real estate in the State.  The IREF regime was introduced in Finance Act 2016 in response to concerns raised regarding the use of certain collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property.  Investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.  The regime provides, with some exceptions, that where a unit holder receives value from the IREF, an IREF withholding tax of 20% will generally apply.<\/p>  <p>  Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out the tax regime applicable to special purpose companies set up to securitise assets.  Section 110 is designed to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation\u00a0purposes.  Section 110 companies can only hold certain qualifying assets -\u00a0real property, such as land and buildings, is not an asset that a qualifying company can hold.  They can however hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value from Irish land and buildings.  Amendments were made to the taxation of section 110 companies in Finance Act 2016 to address the issues relating to the taxation of Irish property.  The changes related to the taxation of qualifying companies which held loans that derived their value from Irish land.  The effect of\u00a0these changes was to ensure that profits generated from Irish real estate remain within the charge to tax.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to acquisitions of property by institutional investors, an investment strategy which includes the purchase (including by forward-funding) of an entire apartment block or development inevitably creates an impression that the investment is disproportionate to other activities in the market, particularly the activities of private home buyers.  However this needs to be seen against a background of still muted supply in the property market and a continuing shortage of rented residential accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, while the role of institutional investors is growing, particularly in the urban apartment market segment, it is still minor in proportion to the total rental sector.  Data provided to\u00a0my Department\u00a0by the Residential Tenancies Board\u00a0for May 2019\u00a0shows that the rented residential accommodation market is\u00a0still dominated\u00a0by small landlords.  The\u00a0majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy, with over 96% of landlords registering 5 tenancies or less.  Landlords with 5 tenancies or less account for almost 72% of all registered tenancies.  The top 21 landlords account for 3.11% of all registered tenancies.  The percentage of landlords with 20 or more tenancies has decreased from 0.52% in 2017 to 0.43% in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Institutional investors have an important role to play in increasing property supply and I am satisfied that\u00a0tax regimes which apply taxation at the level of the investor are appropriate to collective investment vehicles of this nature.  Given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis.  In this context, the\u00a0Deputy may be aware, as part of the 2018 Finance Bill process I committed that my officials would undertake a report\u00a0on REITs, IREFs and Section 110 companies as they invest in the residential property market.

This is directed to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  The previous car scrappage scheme operated from\u00a0January 2010\u00a0to July 2011.  VRT relief of up to &euro;1,500 was available upon registration of a new vehicle, subject to the scrappage of a qualifying old vehicle.  The VRT relief was provided where a new category A, or passenger car of emissions band A or B with CO2 emissions of 140g\/km or lower was purchased and registered and an old car scrapped.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for relief, the scrapped vehicle must have been registered in the State in the name of the purchaser of the new car for at least 18 months previous to the date of scrappage;\u00a0 and\u00a0on the day of scrappage been ten years old or more from the date of first registration. <\/p>  <p>  The current situation\u00a0is different.  There are currently significant Government-backed incentives in place for electric vehicles including\u00a0VRT relief of up to a further &euro;5,000.  Based on this existing relief, a person purchasing an electric vehicle with an Open Market Selling Price of under &euro;36,000 would currently pay no VRT.  This suggests that\u00a0any car scrappage scheme that was based on the provision of VRT relief would be ineffective because no VRT is paid on the registration of most Battery Electric Vehicles to begin with.  The principal effect of any such VRT relief would be to gift taxpayers money to reduce the acquisition costs for buyers of higher end BEVs.  \u00a0In that regard it is unlikely that there would be high volume of motorists with 10 year old cars who\u00a0would be in the market for higher end Battery Electric Vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the market is more complex than in 2010 with the emergence of PCPs as a popular method of acquiring a car for use and potentially purchasing it.

The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector.

The rate was designed to be temporary, but was maintained in subsequent Budgets.  In 2016, the Programme for Partnership Government committed to maintaining the 9% VAT rate, dependent on prices remaining competitive in the sector.  I decided in Budget 2018 not to make any change to the 9% VAT rate.  However, I accepted that the rate must be subject to analysis.  In this context, I asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate ahead of Budget 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0&ldquo;Review of the 9% VAT rate: Analysis of Economic and Sectoral Developments&rdquo; was published by my Department in July 2018, in order to better inform any decision in relation to the 9% reduced rate going forward.  \u00a0In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, and impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looked at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.<\/p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure\u00a0was more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the sector remains strong.  The Review concluded that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector.  The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners also published a report on the 9% VAT Rate\u00a0in June 2018 which analyses the output and employment impact of the 9% VAT rate using Revenue data.  The analysis found an estimated increase in employment of on average 1.8 employees for each firm benefitting from the reduced rate in the accommodation and food sector in the year following the introduction of the reduced rate.  However, beyond the short term, they were unable to distinguish the impact of the rate on employment from the impact of other factors in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Given the impact of\u00a0an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector has only recently been reviewed by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, there does not seem to currently be a case for reviewing the impact of the increase.<\/p>  <p>  However, in noting that changes made in Budget 2019 may present a challenge to the tourism and hospitality sector, an extra &euro;35 million was allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in order to provide more targeted supports.  This allocation includes targeted supports of &euro;4.5 million for regional initiatives such as Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands and the Wild Atlantic Way, and nearly &euro;10 million for the development of greenways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Abolition","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[29801\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to abolish the universal social charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>An inter-departmental working group was established in February 2018 to examine and report on options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI over the medium-term.

Interpretation of this legislation evolves on a continuous basis, as a result of judgements handed down by Irish courts and, ultimately, the CJEU.  Revenue continuously reviews its interpretation of VAT legislation in line with these judgements.  In addition, the European Commission may challenge any Member State where they take the view that the VAT treatment of particular transactions or activities by a Member State are not in accordance with the VAT Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The Directive does not specify the rate of VAT applying to the supply of every known product or service; it provides a framework for the application of rates to broad categories of goods or services.  Within this framework there is room for differing interpretations of the legislation as to the rate of VAT applying to specific goods or services.  In particular this may happen following the development of new goods or services.  In these circumstances, Revenue and taxpayers interpret the law as it stands and if taxpayers disagree with Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation they can appeal the matter to the Tax Appeal Commissioners and ultimately to the CJEU. <\/p>  <p>  VAT legislation does not apply the zero rate of VAT to food supplements but shortly after the introduction of VAT Revenue applied a concessionary zero rating to certain vitamin, mineral and fish oil products.  As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database.  The scope of the relatively narrow original zero rating of food supplement products permitted by Revenue broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated.  After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently concluded a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products.  The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, as well as my colleague the Minister for Health, to ensure that any legislative changes brought\u00a0forward are evidence based.  The results of the consultation will be included in the 2019 VAT Tax Strategy Group paper as part of the Budget 2020 process.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that it is unable to provide information on the number of instances in which it advised taxpayers over the years 2011 to 2017 that particular food supplement products were zero rated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[29985\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has ceased the purchase and use of single-use plastics; the public bodies and agencies under his remit to which he has issued an instruction to cease the purchase and use of single-use plastics; when the instruction issued; the bodies which have confirmed that they no longer purchase and use single-use plastics, respectively; the bodies which have not provided such confirmation to date; when they will confirm; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>My Department had already begun eliminating single use plastics prior to the Government Decision earlier this year regarding actions by Departments and Agencies on single use plastics, prevention of waste and green public procurement.

The different treatment of VAT as regards petrol and diesel relates to the VAT input deductibility entitlement of VAT registered taxpayers.  Businesses who make supplies that are charged to VAT are entitled to claim input VAT on their business expenses.  VAT registered persons are entitled to claim the cost of VAT on the purchase of diesel used in the course of their business, as is the case with most business costs.  However, section 60 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 prohibits VAT deductibility by businesses on certain goods and services which, by their ubiquitous nature, are not easily distinguishable from general non-business use.  This is for anti-avoidance reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on petrol, as well as expenditure on food, drink, accommodation, and entertainment, is specifically excluded from deductibility entitlement, even where the petrol or other goods and services are acquired or used for the purpose of a taxable business.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under Article 176 of the EU VAT Directive, Ireland can retain certain restrictions on VAT deductibility that were in place before 1979.  As VAT input deductibility has been restricted on petrol since 1972, Ireland can retain that block on deductibility.  While it is legally possible to apply the normal rules of VAT deductibility to petrol, once the block on deductibility is eased or removed it would not be possible to re-introduce it.  There is a case for petrol and diesel to be treated equally in terms of input deductibility entitlements as there is a greater level of diesel-run personal motor vehicles in operation today than in the past.  However, the provisions of Article 176 prohibit the application of a new deductibility restriction on diesel expenditure.  As anti-avoidance concerns regarding petrol expenditure deductibility continue,\u00a0the restriction on VAT deductibility remains valid.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that items of expenditure such as the value of petrol purchases are not separately identified on VAT or self-assessed tax returns.  Therefore, an estimate of the cost of allowing VAT registered, self-employed persons to reclaim VAT on petrol purchased for business purposes is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE06700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drainage Schemes Status","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE06600"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[29240\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900068#WRE06700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if funding for a scheme (details supplied) is ringfenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>The River Slaney (Enniscorthy) Flood Relief Scheme is at an advanced stage of planning and design.

If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the school should have a formal complaints procedure that can be followed. This procedure should set out what a parent may have to do and how long it should take to deal with a complaint.\u00a0 The role and responsibilities of the principal and board of management should also be set out. The complaint procedures currently operated by most schools are the standard procedures that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies and a copy should be provided by schools to a parent on request.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, which was published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. As part of the implementation of the Action Plan my Department published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaints procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Where a parent is of the view that a school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should bring the matter to the attention of the patron.\u00a0 In the event that, after raising its concerns with the school patron, a parent still considers\u00a0that the matter has not been resolved, it is open to the parent to raise the matter with the Ombudsman for Children. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may also independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills provided the parent has fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department has been working on the drafting of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing parents. <\/p>  <p>  The key aim of the legislation is to improve how schools engage with students and their parents. Schools will be required to respond to feedback and comments from students and parents where appropriate on matters relating to the school, including as appropriate in relation to their anti-bullying policy.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also provides for the development of new complaints procedures in schools to ensure that grievances of students or their parents relating to the school are dealt with efficiently, effectively, fairly and consistently across schools. <\/p>  <p>  Subject to Government approval, I intend to publish the Bill in the Autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900069#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900069#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[29108\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900069#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if correspondence has been received from a group (details supplied) regarding a school project in County Donegal; if a reply has issued to the correspondence; the status of the progress being made to deliver the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":428,"content":"<p>I have not\u00a0received correspondence from this group in relation to a building project for the school named by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900069#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900069#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[29126\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900069#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) will not lose a teacher for the forthcoming academic year 2019-2020 in view of the altered circumstances since the original determination on teaching resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30th September. <\/p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is due to have\u00a0a teaching post suppressed due to\u00a0a fall in enrolments in September 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

In response, the Government has successfully brought forward a number of amendments to the Judicial Council Bill 2017 that will provide for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee will be tasked with the preparation of personal injuries guidelines and will have all the powers necessary for it to carry out its functions in an efficient and effective manner.\u00a0 The Bill passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 4 July 2019 and is scheduled for completion before the Seanad today, Tuesday 9 July 2019, with a view to its enactment before the summer recess and the establishment of the Judicial Council before the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  As also raised, the Cost of Insurance Working Group\u00a0had called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation.  An industry-funded Garda insurance fraud unit was one option considered in this regard.\u00a0 As I have outlined in my responses to a number of parliamentary questions during the current D&aacute;il session, the Garda Commissioner is of the view that a divisional focus on insurance fraud is preferable to the establishment of a centralised investigation unit.\u00a0 This approach is aligned with the divisional-focussed Garda model.  It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.  As Deputies will appreciate,\u00a0the Garda Commissioner is solely responsible for such organisational matters,\u00a0including the establishment of individual Garda units, their remits and resourcing.  At the same time, there is now a broader\u00a0positive engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0and Insurance Ireland's Anti-Fraud Forum\u00a0who have committed to\u00a0meet on a regular basis to discuss and act upon current and ongoing issues arising in the area of insurance fraud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900072#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications Data","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900072#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[29186\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900072#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set out in tabular form the number of persons from non-EU countries who arrived here seeking refugee status and-or asylum in each of the years 2013 to 2018, by country of origin;

The Board operates 30 full time law centres and a number of part time law centres in Ireland.  The Board also provides mediation services to help separating couples to negotiate their own agreement.<\/p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from my Department.  This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all its offices across the country, as well as the support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's head office.<\/p><p>It is not possible to extract and isolate the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office\/county in a given year as it would be necessary to devise a basis on which to attribute, to each county, all expenditure incurred by the Board centrally.  Complexities may also arise at local level with regard to the delivery of civil legal aid, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply to Ennis Law Centre.  Also, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Legal Aid Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county.<\/p><p>Funding provided to the Legal Aid Board by my Department for the years 2015-2018 is provided in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Budget Allocation\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>32.471<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>34.838<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>38.988<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>40.275<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In the case of criminal legal aid, the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.

The E-Commerce Act 2000 is dealt with by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>  <p>  The Digital Single Market (DSM) agenda, led by my Department, is a whole of government approach coordinated across Government.  The Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) on the Digital Single Market, is chaired by my colleague Pat Breen TD, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection.  The key focus of the IDC is on ensuring effective whole-of-Government engagement with the EU DSM agenda.  The Department of Finance\/Public Expenditure and Reform is represented on the IDC. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has responsibility for the Modernisation of VAT regimes for eCommerce.  In January 2021 new changes will come into effect on the existing VAT regime which will have a significant impact for E-commerce and high street retailers in general.  The main change will be the removal of the existing VAT exemption for goods from outside the EU with a value less than &euro;22.  This will mean that vendors (or online platforms facilitating the vendor) must charge the rate of VAT applicable in the country they are selling into.  This should address the cost advantages that non-EU vendors currently benefit from.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the one-stop shop for VAT registration of distance sales will be extended.  This will mean that online traders will no longer have to register for VAT for business-to-consumer transactions in each of the member states in which they sell, thereby reducing costs.  This will be a significant simplification and easing of the administrative processes involved in selling across the EU.  Together these changes should level the playing field for Irish companies and help them better compete both online and in the High Street.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in Future Jobs Ireland 2019, all businesses, regardless of size or sector, in today&rsquo;s digital environment need to focus on building competitive online capability.  It is clear that the retail sector is undergoing an exciting but also challenging transformation as the digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and beyond.  Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the retail sector, as reflected in the growth in online shopping and changing consumer preferences in terms of how people are shopping in town centres.  Sustaining physical retail outlets requires adaptation: many retailers now offer multiple sales channels to sell their goods, from physical stores, to social media, mobile apps and websites. <\/p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum (RCF), which I chair, was established in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector.  The Department of Finance is represented on the RCF.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Forum&rsquo;s work, the 'Framework for Town Centre Renewal' was launched in April 2017.  The Framework supports towns and villages through their Local Authorities to address the challenges of creating a vibrant and viable town centre.  It sets out the key characteristics of a successful town centre and identifies existing supports and best practice examples from around the country.  The Framework also serves as a support document for towns and villages applying for funding streams under Project 2040 including; the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which can be leveraged to support the regeneration and viability of town centres. <\/p>  <p>  As Chair of the RCF, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability and enhance their competitiveness.  In support of this, and through the Forum, I have introduced a new Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland.  The Online Retail Scheme supports retail businesses of 10 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 percent match fund basis.  The second call for the Online Retail Scheme opened on 19th June and will close on 31st July this year. <\/p>  <p>  A sub-group of the RCF focusing on skills has worked to identify the key skills challenges facing retailers today and to identify practical proposals to address those challenges.  Digital skills were identified as a critical requirement along with marketing and logistics.  Forum member, Retail Ireland Skillnet, has since developed a retail specific digital course and will also, in September 2019, launch the first Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision.<\/p>  <p>  The agencies of my Department offer a range of supports to assist businesses with aspects of e-commerce.  Of particular relevance to the retail sector, the LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity.  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes which are available to high street retailers to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the continuing work of the Retail Consultation Forum and its focus on the current and future developmental needs of the retail sector, the ongoing whole of Government engagement on the DSM agenda, as well as the 2019 commitment under Future Jobs Ireland for my Department to commence a study to understand the full extent and impact of digital transformation on retail business models, I have no plans at present to establish a working group on e-commerce and high-street retail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[29274\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the EU-Mercosur trade deal agreed in principle on 28 June 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>It is important, first and foremost, to acknowledge how vital international trade deals are for Ireland.  As a small, open, export-led economy, we very much support balanced international Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as they help to open up greater market access at reduced costs. <\/p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur deal was agreed in principle on 28th June after nearly 20 years of negotiations.  Irish exporters have been subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions when exporting to Mercosur.  This Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.<\/p>  <p>  Trade with the Mercosur region has grown by 19% in the period 2010 to 2016.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will, we anticipate, allow Irish exporters to expand faster, and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.  In this regard, analysis by my Department has estimated that a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  However, I and my Government colleagues recognise and appreciate the very genuine concerns expressed by the farming community in relation to aspects of the EU-Mercosur deal, most notably the beef tariff rate quota.   <\/p>  <p>  The agreement reached on beef access is more than we had wished.  In that regard, I raised our concerns on our agricultural sensitivities at every opportunity at European Trade Council meetings.  I also raised it directly with the Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, including as recently as 31st May when I wrote to the Commissioner, once again, highlighting our serious concerns, particularly given the current challenges and uncertainty facing the Irish beef sector in light of Brexit.  Additionally, there has been a sustained effort right across Government in relation to this aspect, with both Minister Creed and the Taoiseach also raising this element at the highest levels, including joining Belgium, France and Poland in writing to the Commission President on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement that has been reached on this sensitive area is, however, far less than Mercosur had been looking for - some 300,000 tonnes &ndash; due to the Government&rsquo;s active campaign, with some other Member States, to secure the viability of the Irish and EU beef sector.  While the 99,000 tonnes that is in the deal is still higher than we want it to be, it is less than one third of what they originally sought.  It is also important to state that the 99,000 tonnes will be split into 45% frozen and 55% fresh and is &ldquo;Carcass Weight Equivalent&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the Agreement also ensures that there will be equivalent food safety standards.  The EU&rsquo;s sanitary and phytosanitary standards will not be relaxed in any way, and they remain non-negotiable.  The highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods &ndash; especially food.  The EU will maintain its strict approach on GMOs and hormone beef, and its right to set maximum allowed levels for pesticide residues.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that there are positives for Ireland&rsquo;s food &amp;amp; drink sector in this deal.  One of Ireland&rsquo;s key offensive interests in the Mercosur deal is dairy, and the Agreement sees the removal of tariffs on 30,000 tonnes of cheese, 10,000 tonnes of milk powder, and 5,000 tonnes of infant formula on a reciprocal basis.  Furthermore, the Agreement provides for the protection of 335 Geographical Indicators (GIs) of EU origin &ndash; including Irish Whiskey and Irish Cream.  The acceptance of EU GIs will significantly improve protection of these products from false or misleading branding in Mercosur markets.<\/p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur Agreement also sees the opening up of Mercosur&rsquo;s public procurement market - a market that was not previously available to EU firms.  It will make it easier for Irish firms to bid for, and win, valuable Government contracts in the four Mercosur countries, and the EU and Mercosur have agreed to apply modern disciplines based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and fairness.<\/p>  <p>  There will also be special provisions for SMEs in the Agreement. SMEs will benefit most from the simplification of exporting and customs procedures &ndash; as the savings are proportionately greater for them.  A dedicated website will provide information on the Agreement for SMEs, practical guidance to importing and exporting will be published, and a dedicated data base of tariff reductions will be made available.  The simplification of regulations on standards will help with trade barriers encountered by SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to climate change, Mercosur including Brazil, will have to fully implement the Paris Climate Agreement as part of this deal, as well as meet specific commitments on reforestation. <\/p>  <p>  The Agreement also places particular emphasis on the development of trade between our two regions in a way that is conducive to decent work for all, including women and young people, with each party recognising the importance of core labour standards as defined by ILO Conventions.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the conclusion of the negotiations on 28th June, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is now ensuring that a comprehensive, independent economic assessment is carried out specifically on the finalised EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement.  This assessment will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs, as well as the environmental implications of the deal.  It will also consider how the EU-Mercosur Agreement might exacerbate\/mitigate the likely impact of Brexit for our economy.  This assessment will help to inform our future actions in relation to the EU-Mercosur Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Expenditure","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05825"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[29385\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05850","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount spent on digital marketing in each of the past eight years; the items on which funds were spent; the criteria by which target audiences were selected; the amount of the digital spend targeted here; the amount targeted abroad; the amount that related to private companies; the amount that related to policy initiatives; and the purpose of the digital advertisements.","asker":"1443","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":764,"content":"<p>Details of expenditure incurred by my Department and its Offices on digital marketing are available at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05875","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[29410\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of a work visa for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>My officials inform me that an application for a General Employment Permit in respect of the named individual was submitted to my Department on 20th May 2019.

I am focused on supporting and sustaining existing regional employment while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland.  There are now nearly 230,000 people working in IDA client firms.  Last year saw more IDA-supported jobs added in regional Ireland than at any time over the past 17 years, with 58% of total such employment now located outside of Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that when it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), Drogheda is not being overlooked by the IDA.  Drogheda continues to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the International Business Services, Pharmaceutical and Technology sectors.  Last year saw PCI Pharma announce that 70 new jobs will be created at their facility in Drogheda.  In November 2017, Yapstone announced plans to create 200 new jobs over the next five years at their international headquarters in Drogheda.  These announcements represent a vote of confidence in what Drogheda and the broader North-East region has to offer to multinationals who are looking to locate outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA, for its part, continues to promote Drogheda to investors.  The Agency operates a Business and Technology Park in Drogheda with available land that is being actively marketed to existing and prospective clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, County Louth has seen an almost 4% increase in FDI-driven employment in the last year.  There are now 28 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing 3,903 people and these firms are continuing to grow and develop.  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Drogheda and County Louth, the Government remains determined to achieve more.  That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential of the County.  The IDA remains pivotal to this and the Agency is engaging with its clients and with other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investment there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":780,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK07400"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[29827\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK07500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount spent on tribunals, commissions of investigation and statutory inquiries in each of the years 2009 to 2018 and to date in 2019, by inquiry, tribunal or commission; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>My Department has not had any expenditure on tribunals, commissions of investigation or statutory inquiries during the period in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK07700"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[29894\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900073#WRK07800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the estimated cost of recruiting one additional accountant grade 3 and one extra solicitor at APO level for the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>Pay allocations for employees of my Department are set out in the Department of Public expenditure and Reform Circular &ndash; 16\/2018 &ndash; <i>Application of 1 October 2018 pay adjustments under the Public Service and Pensions Act 2017.<\/i><\/p><p>The following table sets out the estimated cost of recruiting one additional Accountant Grade 3 and one extra Solicitor at APO Level.

While there are many positive and rewarding aspects of caring, it is evident that caring is a significant challenge, affecting all aspects of a family carer&rsquo;s life. The needs of the cared for person can place great demands on the energy and time of the family carer,\u00a0with many providing full time care, which can have a significant impact on their relationships with other people, their professional lives and their physical and mental health and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The 2012 National Carers' Strategy represents a whole of Government response to the challenges faced by family carers and sets out the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Government departments and agencies for carers. The Strategy is designed around a core vision which recognises and respects carers as key care partners who are supported to maintain their own health and well-being, care with confidence and empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life. Oversight of the Strategy is led by\u00a0the Department of Health, while the HSE&rsquo;s Multi Divisional Carer Strategy group continues to support the process across the service divisions to progress the actions in the Strategy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Funding has been secured through the Dormant Accounts fund for information and training supports for family carers. This is\u00a0allowing family carers provide the best care possible to the care recipient, reduce the risk of injury to the carer and care recipient and helping family carers cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of their role. Funding is also being made available to provide for the dissemination of resource information for family carers, the development of support networks and support groups to assist with the transition back into social and economic life at the end of the caring role and measures that assist in promoting carer self-identification.<\/p>  <p>  Identifying carers and their needs as early as possible, is of critical importance\u00a0to ensure\u00a0they are supported in their caring role. The introduction of the Carers&rsquo; Needs Assessment Tool will be a key step in helping to identify carers at all stages and will also play a role in identifying the supports required.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department of Health secured Dormant Accounts funding\u00a0to pilot\u00a0the Carers&rsquo; Needs Assessment Tool in a HSE Community Health Care Organisation this year. This pilot study will greatly benefit the development of a comprehensive, standardised Family Carer Needs Assessment for identifying family carer&rsquo;s needs by providing an opportunity to refine and improve the needs assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of a new statutory scheme for home-support services to enable people with care needs to live at home for as long as possible. Family carers were invited to participate in the public consultation carried out by the Department of Health in 2017, to which approximately 2,600 submissions were received. A report on the findings of the consultation was published in June 2018 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.

This additional funding supports a number of initiatives and capacity  building across the public health system. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the use of diagnostic tools to tackle the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, Strategic Objective 5 of iNAP specifically identifies as an action, the need for assessment of the cost and clinical effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tools.<\/p>  <p>  In line with iNAP, HIQA was requested to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) of near-patient testing to guide antimicrobial prescribing.  In considering the scope of the HTA, antibiotic prescribing in  community settings was identified as an area where there was potential  to influence prescribing patterns using results of diagnostic testing.<\/p>  <p>  Following a scoping review, HIQA identified that CRP point-of-care  testing was the only test with evidence applicable to this scope and  hence, was the subject of the HTA.  The HTA focused on C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing for patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection in the primary care setting.  The HTA review and its findings relate to the clinical use of CRP point-of-care testing, the cost effectiveness, budgetary impact and the organisational issues associated with implementation.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the advice of the HTA, I have now asked my Department to engage with the HSE regarding the establishment of a pilot project.  This would allow for: evaluation of the CRP point-of-care testing in primary care settings; consideration of the sustainability of the benefits of testing; collection of data on costs; and examination of the organisational issues involved in implementing such a pilot project, specifically in the Irish healthcare context.

I very much welcome their active engagement on the important issue of forestry and the environment and it is always encouraging when our young people show deep interest in these issues. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, it should be noted that the national forest estate now covers some 11% of the national land area of Ireland and is at its highest level in over 350 years.  The many benefits which forests provide are widely known and appreciated, including clean air and biodiversity as mentioned in the correspondence.  The recent Climate Action Plan also highlights the role of forestry in terms of carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The Government has consistently encouraged the planting of new forests through the provision of generous grants and premiums under successive Forestry Programmes. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the correspondents that forestry in Ireland operates within a strict legal and regulatory framework to protect forests and also to ensure that forestry operations and activities are carried out in compliance with the principles of sustainable forest management. There is an obligation under the Forestry Act, 2014 to  obtain a felling licence from my Department when removing trees from forests and to replant felled trees. <\/p>  <p>  There are certain instances where the felling of a tree is exempt from the need to obtain a tree felling licence, for example, trees near buildings or in an urban area. Certain bodies, such as local authorities and Waterways Ireland, are also  exempt from the requirement to have a felling licence for reasons such as the removal of trees in the performance of statutory functions. If a  person or organisation has concerns regarding incidents of tree felling by these bodies then they may consider contacting them directly.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the removal of hedgerows by farmers, all beneficiaries under the Basic Payment Scheme and other area based schemes, operated by my Department, must comply with the Statutory Management Requirements and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) standards set out in the relevant EU regulations.  There is a stipulation that hedgerows and trees in a line are designated as landscape features, and under GAEC 7, beneficiaries are obliged to retain and maintain such designated landscape features.  Hedgerows must be maintained and not allowed to become invasive.  Where, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to remove a hedgerow, remove a line of trees or fill in a drain for good reasons such as farmyard expansion, the farmers may do so provided the hedgerow, the line of trees or drain is replaced on a like-for-like basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900081#WRS05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Horses","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900081#WRS05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[29619\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900081#WRS05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason unregistered stray horses have been allowed to remain on lands in Hollyhill, Cork city which have been reported to Cork City Council over the past six months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1374,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[29620\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900081#WRS05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason unregistered stray horses have been allowed to remain on lands in Hollyhill, Cork city which have been reported to his Department over the past six months while they are been traumatised and neglected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1375,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 537 and 553 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Control of Horses Act 1996 provides powers to Local Authorities to deal with stray and abandoned horses and for the designation, by each Local Authority, of control areas in which horses cannot be kept without a licence.

In relation to pollution from traffic sources, the pollutant of greatest concern is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).A report from the Environmental Protection Agency, released this week, indicates areas around certain heavily trafficked roads in the Dublin area, including the M50, may have higher levels of NO2 than previously indicated. The report indicates that away from busy roads, levels of NO2 drop significantly and are well beneath the recommended EU limits in many residential areas. Around the M50, the highest concentrations are within 10 metres of the motorway edge, with levels falling to background levels at a distance of 50 to 75 metres. <\/p><p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an air pollutant associated with urban areas, strongly linked with traffic emissions and which is known to have detrimental impacts on human health. Diesel vehicles have historically far higher nitrogen dioxide emissions than other combustion engines, especially for older vehicles. <\/p><p>This report underlines the need to implement the Climate Action Plan. The Plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing emissions and improving air quality, including targets for electric vehicle numbers. This work will complement the work already underway in developing a Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities. The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including vehicle emissions, in an integrated manner. I intend to publish the Strategy in the coming months.<\/p><p>The European Communities (Environmental Noise) Regulations 2018 provide a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise, including noise emitted by means of road, rail and air traffic. <\/p><p>The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, such as large agglomerations, major roads, railways and airports. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned. The Regulations provide for strategic noise maps and action plans to be made available to the general public.The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.<\/p><p>Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to Local Authorities. The Regulations designate the Environmental Protection Agency as the National Authority for the purposes of the Regulations.

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have made clear my intent, and that of the Government, to transition from diesel fuelled buses towards greener fuels and technologies, for the great potential such technologies offer to reduce carbon and other harmful air pollutant emissions, and importantly, placing the public transport system in a strong leadership role. <\/p>  <p>  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory towards low-emission has firmly been established. In the short term, we are committed under Project Ireland 2040 to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from this month onwards. Consequently, the NTA recently initiated a tender competition to award a &ldquo;Framework Agreement for the Supply of Double-Deck Diesel-Electric Hybrid Buses&rdquo;. To help inform a longer-term bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the NTA, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials which are expected to conclude in the coming weeks. Findings from this trial, alongside EU public fleet procurement requirements under the Clean Vehicles Directive together with on-going market analysis and research will\u00a0collectively inform\u00a0the NTA's\u00a0approach to its bus purchase programme in the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the BusConnects programme will be rolled out across all our major cities, starting in Dublin. This programme is expected to have a transformative effect on the operation of bus services and will improve bus journey times by 40% to 50%; provide a bus service that is easier to use and understand; enable more people to travel by bus than ever before; and provide a network of cycling infrastructure that will enable more people to cycle. Low emitting buses will be employed under the BusConnects programme with the intention that 50% of the public urban bus fleet in the Greater Dublin Area will transition to a low emitting option by 2023 and 100% by 2030. Buses will be replaced when they reach the end of their optimal life. For the double deck bus fleet this is approximately 12 years.\u00a0 It is important to note that additional vehicles may also be required to increase capacity on the network to cater for increasing travel demand or any new services.<\/p>  <p>  Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your question to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.

This preparation is continuing through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. While planning continues for both a no-deal Brexit and the &lsquo;central case&rsquo; scenario, the Government is focussing its preparations on a no-deal Brexit on 31st October 2019.<\/p>  <p>  While the full implications of Brexit for our air and maritime transport are not yet clear, I do not anticipate that direct maritime or direct air services by community air carriers between Ireland and continental Europe will be affected, even in a no-deal Brexit scenario.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  That said, a significant proportion of our goods destined for EU markets are transported via the UK landbridge to access these markets. Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the landbridge route particularly where there are increased border and custom procedures and associated delays, or were the UK to subsequently apply differing standards, road charging or regulatory regimes. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food\/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this key route to European markets will be detrimental for certain sectors. Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken through the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in seeking to ensure continued access through the landbridge to markets in continental Europe. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. Following a series of meetings between my officials and the major ferry companies operating at Irish ports, I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports. These services include the MV Celine which was last year launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and the MV WB Yeats, which is operating between Dublin and Cherbourg since March 2019. Additionally, a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  If disruption to the landbridge does arise, it is likely to be most acute in the immediate period following the UK exit. My Department, along with IMDO, will be implementing a number of mitigating actions to encourage a market response in a timely manner. These will include a focussed awareness campaign from early September aimed at shipping companies, importers and exporters to create a dialogue between them to identify new market demands as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity. Key actions planned include a new runway for Dublin Airport, continued development of Cork and Shannon Airports, investment in Ireland West Airport Knock, and for smaller airports under the Regional Airports Programme. There will also be major development of Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes and other ports, as well as investment in transport connectivity to ports.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding adequate travel provisions in the air travel sector, under EU law, air operators must fulfil certain ownership and control (O&amp;C) criteria in order to be classified as an EU air carrier.\u00a0 The European Commission has been clear from the outset that it is essential for air operators for whom Brexit may lead to a failure to comply with these requirements to take appropriate counter measures. The EU Contingency Regulation on Air Connectivity set down a timeframe for restructuring plans to be submitted to national regulators. All affected air operators licensed in Ireland have submitted their respective restructuring plans to the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR), within the 11th April deadline under the EU basic connectivity regulation. CAR has issued its determinations on these plans and is in ongoing contact with these airlines in relation to their restructuring plans and these determinations have been notified to the European Commission. It is understood that the Commission will review all such proposals. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Regulation (EU) 2019\/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity aims to ensure the continuation of a basic level of air connectivity for citizens and business between the UK and Europe in the event of the UK exiting the EU without an agreement. While certain provisions within this Regulation have entered into force, the majority will only apply if and when the UK exits the EU without a deal.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":1763,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1764,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[30062\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the degree to which the transport and tourism sectors expect to be in a position to respond positively to the challenges of climate change in a realistic way while maintaining services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1765,"content":"<p>The recently published Climate Action Plan sets out a whole-of Government approach to climate action and maps a potential pathway to meet Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 emission reduction commitments. The Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption.<\/p>  <p>  The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, plays a key role in the national decarbonisation effort. It is worth noting that transport emissions are classified under both the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS)\u00a0and non-ETS systems. Generally, non-domestic emissions such as those from international aviation within Europe\u00a0are accounted for under the ETS\u00a0system while domestic transport emissions fall under\u00a0the non-ETS system. The Climate Action Plan deals primarily with the non-ETS sector, where Ireland has a legal binding emissions reduction target\u00a0of 20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels).\u00a0 Accordingly, the focus of the transport elements of the Plan relate mainly to reducing land transport emissions and not those generated by international travel and in-coming tourists. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions for inclusion in the Climate Action Plan, particularly in relation to public transport and active travel.\u00a0 A critical challenge is reducing the 52% of transport emissions that come from private car use.\u00a0 Our aim in\u00a0expanding the carrying capacity and the attractiveness of our public transport and active travel networks is\u00a0to provide a viable sustainable alternative to private car use for more people for more of their journeys.\u00a0Under Project Ireland 2040, an indicative allocation of &euro;8.6 billion is assigned to support sustainable mobility ensuring that public transport and active travel become more\u00a0available and attractive\u00a0alternatives. <\/p>  <p>  A switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key mitigation measure\u00a0of\u00a0the Plan, with a target of almost 950,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2030. While this level of transition is incredibly challenging, as technologies improve and become cheaper, and if we continue incentives and invest in the recharging network we are ambitious that with a real push we can make real progress towards this target by 2030. Concerted efforts across several Departments will be essential if we are to maintain a supportive environment to assist citizens in making the greener choice and switching to an EV. My Department and I will work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the roadmap that will be necessary to achieve our\u00a0collective ambition.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of tourism, while there are no specific actions in the Plan, climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. Urban tourism may be less affected than coastal tourism where sea level rise, increasing ocean acidification and coastal erosion can threaten Ireland&rsquo;s coastal tourism infrastructure and natural attractions. It is difficult to predict possible changes to Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination as a result of climate change and the impact of this on the economic value of tourism in Ireland and tourism demand. Destination attractions such as Skellig Michael and the Burren could be especially vulnerable; therefore the role of the tourism sector in adaptation planning is extremely important. <\/p>  <p>  The range of implications of climate change on the transport, tourism, and even sport sectors means that I and my Department\u00a0are fully committed to achieving the climate change objectives set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and I hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall as they did in 2018. Indeed, every sector must\u00a0step-up if Ireland is to meet our emission reduction targets in 2030 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Calming Measures","counter":1766,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1767,"qnumday":682,"qnumall":"[30063\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to combat the traffic congestion on the M50; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1768,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, \u00a0operation and improvement of individual national roads\u00a0is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)\u00a0in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) along with other stakeholders, is continuing to implement a number of measures on the\u00a0M50\u00a0to optimise operational efficiency.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that \u00a0a single piece of infrastructure cannot be looked at in isolation in an urban context.\u00a0 The National Transport Authority&rsquo;s (NTA) Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016- 2035 sets out a number of projects and initiatives for the Greater Dublin Area that, when implemented, will greatly ease congestion for commuters.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes,\u00a0there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. Ensuring that this money is properly accounted for, and that as many children as possible benefit from it, is a core responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Pobal assists the Department in the administration of the funding and in ensuring that services are compliant with the clearly documented rules of the schemes.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Public Accounts Committee on June 13 paid significant attention to this matter and highlighted the importance of compliance with scheme rules. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs' approach to compliance, and supporting services, strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. The approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended through a strong compliance framework.<\/p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes\u00a0is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment.\u00a0It is\u00a0a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by the Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, which are available on the DCYA website. As stated above, compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  Part of Pobal&rsquo;s role in overseeing compliance is to carry out unannounced visits to services to check their compliance with programme rules. Subsidies for the Early Learning and Care and School Age childcare programmes are paid based on child attendance, which is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. Where Pobal discover that the actual attendance of a child does not match registrations for that child on Pobal&rsquo;s Programme Implementation Platform (Pobal's IT system) they will calculate the amount of funding that has been overclaimed. The service will be advised by Pobal to make the necessary corrections to PIP registrations to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct. There is an appropriate amount of flexibility applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case by case basis. However, the recovery of overclaimed funds is an integral part of ensuring that public money is properly accounted for.<\/p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the period October 2018 &ndash; March 2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which required immediate attention. Under CCSP,\u00a0if a child increases or decreases their attendance, the service provider must update PIP registrations to reflect the actual attendance of that child.\u00a0Following a compliance visit, funding is only corrected to account for the time\u00a0a\u00a0particular child actually attends a service.\u00a0\u00a0My Department does not\u00a0collect information on the number of children for whom incorrect registrations are identified through compliance visits.\u00a0However, in the period October 2018 - March 2019,\u00a0233\u00a0services operating CCSP contracts were found to need to update PIP registrations to match the actual attendance of children. Over this\u00a0six-month period,\u00a0Pobal estimated that approximately &euro;1.4 million in potential overclaims were identified and prevented on the CCSP programme, with approximately &euro;4.7 million potential overclaims identified and prevented across all programmes. These figures come with caveats owing to the type of data involved.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the compliance activity should not result in any child having any service withdrawn, rather that the service provider only claims from the Department for the hours the child is attending. Data available to the Department shows that the number of children accessing Government subsidies continues to increase. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Significant support is available to services facing sustainability issues to bring their service onto a sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.\u00a0I would recommend all services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or\u00a0advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.<\/p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which I published last November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Expenditure","counter":1777,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1778,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[29386\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX06600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount spent on digital marketing in each of the past eight years; the items on which funds were spent; the criteria by which target audiences were selected; the amount of the digital spend targeted here; the amount targeted abroad; the amount that related to private companies; the amount that related to policy initiatives; and the purpose of the digital advertisements.","asker":"1443","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1779,"content":"<p>Six digital marketing campaigns have been run by my Department over the past number of years.

This publication, which estimates that Ireland spends 0.1% of GDP on pre-primary education, is based on public investment levels from 2015. I understand the OECD Education at a Glance Report 2019 is currently being drafted.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD adopt a number of approaches to calculate Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on early learning and care. One approach includes an estimate of the cost of primary school for children under 6 as well as other early learning and care costs: this is to account for the fact that many children in Ireland start primary school at an earlier age than in some other countries. Using this approach, the OECD estimates that Ireland spent 0.5% of GDP on early learning and care in 2016. The OECD indicates that every .1% of GDP increase above this will cost &euro;300 million. If the cost of primary school for children under six is excluded, Ireland spent just 0.2% of GDP on early learning and care. This level of investment in 2016 investment compares poorly to other European countries where the OECD average investment on children under six is 0.8%. It also falls short of the UNICEF-recommended investment level of 1% of GDP. <\/p>  <p>  Historically, there has been low levels of investment in early learning and care in Ireland. Since 2015 however, we have started to address this. Over the past four budgets, investment in early learning and care and school age childcare has increased by some 117% - rising from in &euro;260 million 2015 to &euro;574 million in 2019. Notwithstanding this very significant progress, investment remains relatively low to other developed countries.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The OECD in its report - Faces of Joblessness - compared the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare supports previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the National Childcare Scheme. For a lone parent working full time at the 25th percentile of the full-time earnings distribution, Early Learning and Care costs in Ireland were the highest among all OECD countries in 2015. The Faces of Joblessness report estimated that NCS will bring net ELC costs down to make Ireland only the 11th highest in the OECD, or closer to the OECD average. This analysis was performed before Budget 2019 which increased the NCS thresholds at both ends and which would have enhanced the results further if included.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  First 5: A Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families published in November 2018 sets out an ambitious programme of work across Government Departments to improve the experiences and outcomes of children in Ireland from birth to age 5 across all aspects of their lives in the coming ten years.\u00a0 One of the major objectives is that babies and young children have access to safe, high-quality, developmentally appropriate Early Learning and Care which reflects diversity of need.\u00a0 Allied to that objective, First 5 identifies as a key building block additional public funding, strategically invested to achieve the best outcomes for babies, young children and their families.\u00a0 Under this objective, First 5 commits to at least doubling investment in Early Learning and Care by 2028.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900086#WRX07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Funding","counter":1788,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1789,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[29457\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the timeline for the completion of the sponsorship agreement in advance of the roll out of the national childcare service; the status of the training for frontline staff that will be involved in the administration of the sponsorship service; if detailed qualifying criteria have been agreed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1790,"content":"<p>The Childcare Support Act 2018 makes provision for specific statutory bodies to access childcare to support vulnerable children and families and for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to enter into formal agreements with the various bodies for these purposes.\u00a0 Engagement is ongoing between my officials and each of the bodies in relation to the terms of agreements under which vulnerable children will be referred to the scheme.\u00a0 The terms of each agreement will include such matters as the qualifying criteria under which children will be referred. <\/p>  <p>  Engagement is very advanced and is progressing well.\u00a0 It is anticipated that agreements will be in place with each of the bodies before the launch of the National Childcare Scheme in the Autumn. <\/p>  <p>  Where a referral is made by a sponsor body, the families will automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income test.\u00a0 The agreement between the Minister and each sponsor body will specify details under which children will be referred, including age limits having regard to the provisions of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  Training will be provided for frontline staff who will be involved in the referral of vulnerable children to the National Childcare Scheme under sponsor agreements.

The levying of commercial rates is the responsibility of the Valuations Office, which falls under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.\u00a0 Under Schedule 4, paragraph 22, community childcare facilities are exempt from commercial rates, by virtue of the fact that they operate on a not-for-profit basis. The Valuations Office have also advised that, under Schedule 4 paragraph 10, facilities who provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE) only are exempt from commercial rates.\u00a0 All other childcare providers are, therefore, rateable. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has made considerable investment in the provision of affordable and accessible quality childcare, and I am conscious

Scheme (NCS), the new, national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare, in October 2019.\u00a0 If an ECCE-only service wishes to offer NCS it will become liable for commercial rates.\u00a0 This disincentivisation to provide wraparound services has the potential to create capacity issues within the sector, at a time when my Department is seeking to increase capacity.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rates is one that has been raised by the early learning and care sector, in particular through the National Early Years Forum, which I established in 2016.\u00a0 My Department has therefore taken a number of steps to pursue this matter, including meeting with relevant officials to explore the possibility of obtaining an exemption of the

In July 2018 I brought the high-level scheme outline to Government for Information; this outline was arrived at following detailed consultation with the sector and young people, relevant evidence review and a sampling process. The outline stated that young people aged 10 to 24 years of age who are described in the National Youth Strategy (NYS) as marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable will be the primary target group for services available through the TYFS.<\/p>  <p>  This outline has since provided the basis for further development of the scheme, the final drafting process of which is currently underway. In addition to development of the new scheme, significant other changes have been introduced including; in January of this year, four funding streams were successfully collapsed in to one scheme in advance of the introduction of the new scheme in 2020. In April 2019, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) was signed between my Department and each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and the process of transferring funds to their functional ETB area began on a phased basis. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout this reform my Department has been engaging proactively with the stakeholders and sample services in relation to various component of the new scheme. In 2018, 6 ETBs participated in a trial and co-design of the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement Tool (APNARS). The tool is designed to enable Education and Training Boards (ETB), who have a mid-level governance role in the new youth funding scheme, to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their ETB functional area to enable better targeting of services for young people. Based on the information gathered, the ETB analyse the needs of young people in the area and consider the extent to which these needs are being met within existing youth service provision. Completing the tool provides ETBs with a systematic and evidence-informed assessment of needs to inform judgements about priorities for service provision. It also ensures that youth services\/projects funded under the new scheme are focused on working to meet the identified needs and key issues in the area in line with the stated objectives of the new scheme. The tool also provides a standardised national template for producing an area profile, needs assessment and Service Requirement document across all ETBs. The tool is a critical component in an evidence-informed approach to providing well targeted services to young people. Service Requirement documents will issue from ETBs to services\/projects who are applying for funding through the grant application process on the targeted groups and key issues that are priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Data","counter":1840,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1841,"qnumday":708,"qnumall":"[29810\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY05500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of new youth projects that commenced in 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019 under the young persons facilities and services fund; the location of the projects; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1842,"content":"<p>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to new youth projects set up under the young persons facilities and services fund (YPFSF 1 and 2) for the years 2017 to 2019.\u00a0 No new services were set up under this funding in that period.\u00a0<\/p><p>However, as the Deputy may be aware, my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken.

PPFS is a programme of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, as part of its National Service Delivery Framework. The programme seeks to strengthen and develop Tusla&rsquo;s prevention, early intervention and family support services. <\/p>  <p>  PPFS has been driven by a logic model which aims to realise a series of medium-term and long-term outcomes for the programme. In the medium-term, these outcomes include ensuring the effective operation of Tusla&rsquo;s prevention and early intervention services, increasing the rigour of the agency&rsquo;s commissioning approach, and embedding the participation of children and parents in Tusla&rsquo;s culture and operations. In the longer term, it includes improved outcomes for children and parents, and value for money in service provision, achieved through shifting Tusla&rsquo;s family support budget in favour of evidence-informed prevention and early intervention services. <\/p>  <p>  It aims to achieve these outcomes through five main operational work streams. These work streams are Meitheal and Child and Family Support Networks, Children&rsquo;s Participation, Parenting Support and Parental Participation, Public Awareness, and Commissioning. <\/p>  <p>  In practice the Meitheal model\u00a0focuses on identifying, understanding, and responding to the needs and strengths of children, young people and families in a timely manner to provide help and support to improve outcomes. It is intended to be used when children and young people need support around, for example, behavioural issues or emotional needs, but do not meet the threshold for an intervention by Tusla&rsquo;s Child Protection and Welfare service. <\/p>  <p>  The family&rsquo;s voluntary involvement in identifying their strengths and needs and developing associated action plans is a key part of the process. In some cases, a single organisation can provide support but in general a team of people from a number of agencies with relevant expertise is brought together to work with the parents or guardians, the child or young person. A co-ordinated action plan is developed to meet the needs of the child or young person and if necessary other family members. Regular meetings are held to review the progress made and to discuss possible new actions.<\/p>  <p>  PPFS was subject to an evaluation study by the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at NUI Galway, published in September 2018. The evaluation found that the\u00a0Meitheal practice model was improving family outcomes, particularly among mothers, and that it was valued by participating families. <\/p>  <p>  For 2019, a budget of &euro;9.5 million has been allocated to the PPFS and Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programmes.\u00a0This figure includes &euro;8.2 million which has been ring-fenced for the ABC Programme funding community based prevention services.\u00a0&euro;1.3 million has been allocated to support the\u00a0PPFS, and the ABC\u00a0Programme has transitioned to the PPFS.\u00a0To\u00a0consolidate this important work\u00a0the PPFS is a central subgroup of each Children and Young People's Services Committees (CYPSC)\u00a0which are in place in every county. \u00a0My Department has led this strategic development and integration to ensure that a robust prevention and early intervention infrastructure comprising all relevant services is in place in local communities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":1852,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY06600"},{"type":"question","counter":1853,"qnumday":712,"qnumall":"[29940\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY06700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of Tusla staff trained in the use of signs of safety since its inception; the number that remain with Tusla; and the number of staff not trained in the practice.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1854,"content":"<p>I wish to advise that my officials have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":1855,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY06900"},{"type":"question","counter":1856,"qnumday":713,"qnumall":"[29941\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900087#WRY07000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if a practice (details supplied) used by Tusla is provided under a licence agreement; and if so, the budget for such an agreement.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1857,"content":"<p>The practice referred to by the Deputy\u00a0is an innovative strengths-based, safety-organised approach to child protection casework.

The payment also recognises the time required to perform activities outside of contact time with children, such as preparing materials for early learning and care sessions and assisting parents in understanding how they might benefit from the various early learning and care and school age childcare schemes supported by the State.<\/p>  <p>  The PSP was first introduced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2017 with an initial budget of &euro;14.5m and has been increased since then to amount to &euro;19.4m in 2019. Prior to that it was intended that capitation payments for ECCE or subsidies under the targeted programmes, together with parental co-payments, would cover all costs associated with the schemes including administrative overheads. While the budget for PSP has increased since introduction, the PSP remains a budget limited programme that cannot be demand lead and must therefore be reconsidered on an annual basis as circumstances change; for example significantly increased child registrations. The distribution of the 2019 PSP has been designed to be fair, effective and in keeping with the general policy set in previous years, in so far as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 PSP is calculated as equal to 7 days&rsquo; (1.4 weeks&rsquo;) registrations for ECCE at standard capitation, and 14 days&rsquo; (2.8 weeks&rsquo;) registrations for CCS(P) and TEC. The June 2019 payment is made in respect of the programme year 2018\/2019. As in previous years, the payment is based on child registrations at a snapshot point in the year.  <\/p>  <p>  As we countdown towards the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme, it is important that providers continue to be supported. There will be an additional &euro;2m (over and above the &euro;19.4m described above) associated with the National Childcare Scheme which will be made available to service providers later in 2019 as &ldquo;Transitional Support Payment&rdquo;. This one-off payment is being provided to support providers to meet the administrative requirements associated with transitioning to a new Scheme. The size of the maximum payment available to each service will be based on the number of services applying and the number of children in those service who were actively registered on one of the Department&rsquo;s childcare programmes on 13th May 2019. Finally, it should also be noted that the subsidies for the NCS have been calculated to reflect the full costs (contact with children and non-contact\/ administrative ) of delivering early learning and care and school age childcare services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900088#WRZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":1878,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900088#WRZ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1879,"qnumday":721,"qnumall":"[29979\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900088#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her Department has ceased the purchase and use of single-use plastics; the public bodies and agencies under her remit to which she has issued an instruction to cease the purchase and use of single-use plastics; when the instruction issued; the bodies that have confirmed they no longer purchase and use single-use plastics, respectively; the bodies that have not provided such confirmation to date; when they will confirm; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1880,"content":"<p>My Department has ceased the purchase of single-use plastics in response to the Government decision in January 2019 that government departments, public bodies, and schools will lead the way in the response to cutting down on single use plastics, with a number of measures, including no longer purchasing single-use plastic cups, cutlery and straws for use within their offices.<\/p>  <p>  My Department advised agencies under its remit of this decision in early February 2019 and the Adoption Authority and Oberstown Children's Detention Campus have confirmed to my officials they also no longer purchase single-use plastics.

I believe the deliberate mis-classification of a worker as a self-employed contractor, in a situation where they are actually working as an employee, is wrong. It is wrong for three reasons. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, it denies the worker full protection under the Social Welfare Act, which means he or she is deprived of entitlements such as short-term illness and disability benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, it deprives the worker of protection under labour law which means the a worker is left without any redress if they are unfairly dismissed, made redundant, or are not paid minimum wage rates, for example.<\/p>  <p>  Thirdly, this form of non-compliance by employers deprives all taxpayers in the form of reduced returns to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  I have assigned my officials the task of modernising the Code of Practice on employment status. This is a vital tool for employers and employees so they can be clear when a worker is genuinely self-employed or alternatively when they should be recorded as an employee under full PRSI. A new manual &ndash; the Guidance on Employment Status &ndash; is almost finalised and I have said that I will be circulating it to ICTU and IBEC before it is published to get their input. <\/p>  <p>  The new Guidance will be put on a statutory footing, to ensure it becomes central to the decision-making process in employment status cases.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that enforcement of PRSI compliance is paramount and I want strong enforcement activity to complement the new Guidance provisions. My Department's inspectors have commenced a campaign of increasing the level of employer inspections nationwide. I have established a new Unit of inspectors, specifically trained and dedicated to the detection and tackling of false self-employment in particular.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone who has a query or concern about how their employment has been classified by an employer to contact Scope Section of my Department. Scope Section will commence an investigation, which can involve referral of the matter out to a Social Welfare Inspector, and ultimately decide on the appropriate employment status.<\/p>  <p>  A good deal of progress has been made by my officials in developing a number of legislative proposals that strengthen the protections for workers in situations of false self-employment. These include providing anti-penalisation provisions for workers who will be able to take a claim to the WRC if they are victimised by an employer for raising a query regarding their status. I also wish to increase penalties for employers who deliberately mis-classify employees as self-employed. <\/p>  <p>  There is no easy solution to the issue of deciding employment status &ndash; if there were, the Courts would have ruled on it years ago. There are complex legal aspects to it and each case rests on its own facts. I also need to be mindful of the constitutional rights of employers and workers to manage their business and freely choose their employment status.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to finalise the Guidance document and the legislative proposals and I hope to progress these as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that case involving an airline was investigated and decided upon and it is currently on appeal with the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

At the end of Quarter 1 2019, there were\u00a0just\u00a0over\u00a045,900 households having their housing needs met via HAP. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme for social housing tenants more generally. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is laid down in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that; <\/p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;<\/p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and<\/p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority has its own separate differential rent scheme or schemes in operation. As rent is calculated using each local authority&rsquo;s own formula, the schemes do vary in a number of ways from each other. This is particularly the case when it comes to what may or may not be considered as reckonable\/assessable income for rent purposes e.g., disability allowance and carer's allowance. <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for the Minister to introduce a national rents framework for social housing tenants. Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft of such a framework, which has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, to ensure that rent schemes are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market. The general over-arching principle that rents should be related to incomes will be maintained. <\/p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future, at which point I will consider what proposals might be brought to Government as part of a wider social housing reform package of measures, that would continue to ensure that housing support goes to those who need it most within a system that is responsive to people&rsquo;s changing needs and circumstances. I hope to finalise this matter by the end of Q3 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":2233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2234,"qnumday":838,"qnumall":"[29262\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD04200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of a project (details supplied); and the number of permanent dwelling and demountable dwellings provided.","asker":"1278","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2235,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) in their areas.\u00a0 My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0proposal was received by my Department from Cork County Council \u00a0to carry out upgrade\u00a0works at the site concerned through the construction of\u00a02 bungalows and 5 permanent\u00a0halting bays.\u00a0 Following consultation, approval for these works was granted by my Department in June 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Eligibility","counter":2236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":2237,"qnumday":839,"qnumall":"[29264\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD04500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to change the tenant purchase scheme to allow tenants with only social welfare income to qualify for the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2238,"content":"<p>The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015, provide the basis for the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme for existing local authority houses.\u00a0 The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.\u00a0 To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.\u00a0There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. <\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD06400"},{"type":"question","counter":2256,"qnumday":846,"qnumall":"[29446\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070900092#WRDD06500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the costs paid to companies (details supplied) for projects in respect of which each was engaged by his Department in each of the years 2015 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form;
