Research published to date has focused on education systems and outcomes, primary healthcare, foreign direct investment and the services economy. Research in 2022 is examining productivity, renewable energy supports, migrant integration, and early years care and education on the island. <\/p><p>The National Economic and Social Council was requested by my Department to prepare a comprehensive report to Government on Shared Island, which was published on 12 April, following broad consultation by NESC across the island. NESC made recommendations on a range of environmental, social and economic issues, which the Government will positively consider in consultation with our partners in the Executive and UK Government. My Department provides annual funding to NESC for the delivery of its work programme and there was no specific funding for the Shared Island research work.<\/p><p>The Shared Island unit in my Department has partnered with the Irish Research Council (IRC) to issue a competitive call for academic contributions to the Shared Island research programme, as part of the IRC&rsquo;s New Foundations scheme, with project awards of up to &euro;20,000. Eleven successful research projects were announced by the IRC in December 2021 in areas extending across culture, science, education, law, equality and community relations. Final reports will be published through the second half of this year. A second Shared Island funding call with the Irish Research Council will issue later this month.<\/p><p>The Shared Island unit has also partnered with the Standing Conference on Teacher Education, North and South (SCoTENS), and a funding call was conducted for action-oriented research, to inform professional and policy development considerations in the education sector on a shared island basis across themes of educational attainment and curriculum delivery. Five projects received funding awards from SCoTENS of up to &euro;25,000. Two projects on educational attainment issues will report in Q4 2022 and three on curriculum delivery in Q4 2023.<\/p><p>The Shared Island unit in my Department is also working with other Departments to co-commission research on Shared Island policy priorities for Government. The first instance of this is with the Department of Transport which issued a tender in January for research to examine the safety, regulatory and infrastructure frameworks for renewable hydrogen on the island of Ireland, and the result of this tender will be confirmed later this month. <\/p><p>Finally, the Shared Island unit has commissioned research to contribute to the Shared Island Dialogue series. Professor Deirdre Heenan conducted scoping research for the unit on &lsquo;Collaborating on Healthcare on an All-Island Basis&rsquo; which was published as a discussion paper for the Shared Island Dialogue on Healthcare in July 2021.<\/p><p>Funding commitments to date for the Shared Island research programme led by my Department are set out in tabular form below.<\/p><p>Separately, the Government allocated &euro;40 million from the Shared Island Fund to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for delivery of the new North South Research Programme, which is administered by the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In March, a total of &euro;37.3 million in awards by the HEA to sixty-two collaborative research projects between academics and institutions in Ireland and in Northern Ireland were announced. The awards range in value from &euro;200,000 over two years to &euro;4 million over four years.

minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.\u00a0 The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.\u00a0 The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.<\/p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states.\u00a0 Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in applications for employment permits over the course of 2021 and into 2022 which has impacted on processing times.\u00a0 From the start of January 2021 to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.\u00a0 Processing times have also increased as a result of the HSE cyber-attack which had a direct effect on employment permit applications associated with the July 2021 Doctors' rotation, which had to be processed manually.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Cognisant of the significant impact the pandemic has had on the Hospitality Sector, when the sector reopened in July 2021, the Department committed to prioritise the processing of chef employment permit applications received in the processing queue at that time, in order to support the sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recognises the impact delays in the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and significant resources have been allocated to processing times.\u00a0The Department is very conscious of the current timeframes for processing General Employment Permit applications and the Employment Permits Unit are committed to reducing these. <\/p>  <p>  An plan of action has been implemented which has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system. \u00a0The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels. <\/p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress to reduce the processing time for applicants.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is placing a particular focus on 'new' employment permit applications over renewal applications, however it is important to note that once a Renewal application has been submitted within the period prescribed, the non-EEA National can continue to work while the application is awaiting processing.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Renewal applications will of course continue to be processed, however the focus of the Employment Permits Unit will be directed at new applications in the main processing queue. \u00a0From 7 March, Renewal applications have their own separate processing queue and timeline on the Department&rsquo;s website.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Unit is currently processing Horticultural and Meat Sector General Employment Permits applications which were submitted in early December 2021, in addition to all other permits submitted then.\u00a0 Given the large volume of applications from the Agriculture sector (c.1,000 horticulture applications and c.2,000 meat applications) we anticipate that it will take a further 1-2 weeks to fully process all these applications, in addition to normal processing workload.\u00a0 The Department expects to see a consistent fall in waiting times for General Employment Permits from mid-May, with processing times considerably reduced by end Q2.<\/p>  <p>  The Department published details of processing times on its website.\u00a0 In addition, applicants can enquire about the status of a particular Employment Permit Application vis the status form on the Department&rsquo;s website -

The first National Implementation Plan, published in 2018, set out Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to achieve the SDGs both domestically and internationally. Substantial progress has been achieved in recent months in respect of reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of Agenda 2030 and identifying key priorities and actions for inclusion in the next National Implementation Plan. It is intended that the second national implementation plan will be published in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the key role that businesses play in achieving sustainable development. Business and industry are one of the 2030 Agenda&rsquo;s nine &ldquo;Major Groups&rdquo; which play a crucial role in sustainable development, underlining the importance of engaging with this sector and ensuring that they are supported in progressing the work of the SDGs.<\/p>  <p>  The business sector is essential for the achievement of Irelands SDG targets and is explicitly linked to a number of SDGs such as Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Further, the majority of SDGs are reliant on business sector contribution. For example, business policies and practices play an integral part to the achievement of goals such as gender equality (Goal 5) and climate action (Goal 13).<\/p>  <p>  Feedback received during the consultation process for the second national SDG implementation plan indicated a greater desire in the business community for engagement with the goals. Businesses also expressed an interest in the development of a mechanism for the sector to report on their current work and contribute to the progression of Irelands goals and targets. Based on this feedback, one of the actions envisaged under the forthcoming second implementation plan will be the exploration and development of a suitable mechanism or forum to facilitate and support the business sector in their contribution to the delivery of goals and targets.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has begun initial discussions with the UN Global Compact regarding the establishment of a network here in Ireland. The Compact supports businesses globally to align their work with ten principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, as well as advance the SDGs. The establishment of an Irish network would be a positive development for encouraging sustainable practice among Irish enterprise in making progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal targets, and it is something which the Department will work to facilitate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400056#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400056#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[22248\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400056#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the details of secondments from his Department to the university third level sector over the past two years;

However, to assist national users, the EPA publishes a provisional inventory within a shorter timeframe.

This will see publication of EPA greenhouse gas reports published several months earlier than has been the case in the past.

Mobile coverage obligations are set out in licences granted by\u00a0the independent regulator, ComReg, to mobile operators. ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of regulatory interventions, ComReg is currently in the process of running another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide. The Taskforce met last week to agree a new work programme focused on ensuring access to high quality telecommunications\u00a0connectivity across Ireland to support social and economic development.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services.

This has caused a spike in the price of crude oil and refined products on the retail market.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme will provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.<\/p>  <p>  One of the requirements that must be met in order to hold a road haulage operator licence is that of professional competence.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p><p>I note that the details supplied relate to a recent survey by the Alliance for Insurance Reform on the cost of liability insurance for organisations. I note the important work of the Alliance and my Department has had a number of good engagements with this important stakeholder group. While I would note the survey is a useful indicator, it appears to only survey the Alliance&rsquo;s own members and therefore cannot be said to be representative of the total market. <\/p><p>The separate National Claims Information Database (NCID), managed by the Central Bank of Ireland, provides the best official statistical basis to assess pricing for employer and public liability insurance due to the breadth and depth of its policy coverage. The NCID collects substantial amounts of verified data on the cost of employer and public liability insurance across all sectors and policies. I would note that according to the first NCID Report on Employers&rsquo; Liability, Public Liability and Commercial Property insurance, published last year, many businesses are accessing affordable insurance. The Report shows that in 2019, the average premium for package policies was &euro;2,269, and 93% of all policies had a premium of less than &euro;5,000.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, I do accept that premiums for some businesses and organisations may still be rising.  This may be due to particular issues in those sectors, which our <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform <\/i>is addressing. The insurance reform agenda is still ongoing and that it may take some time for the benefits of the reforms to feed through to reduced premiums and greater availability of insurance for businesses and other groups.<\/p><p>I would note that the second <i>Implementation Report<\/i>of the <i>Action Plan<\/i>, published in March this year showed that insurance reform is progressing well, with some 80% of actions in the <i>Plan<\/i>now being delivered, and the remaining ones initiated. It is my hope that the cumulative impact of these reforms will be to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for businesses, particularly SMEs, as well as consumers and other groups.<\/p><p>Work is continuing across Government to ensure the implementation of the remaining Action Plan reforms.

Battery electric vehicles with an OMSP of below &euro;40,000 are entitled to a VRT reduction of up to &euro;5,000, which has the effect of reducing their VRT to zero. A tapered relief applies for battery electric vehicles with an OMSP of between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000.\u00a0 There is no relief for higher value vehicles.<\/p><p>The law governing VRT remains under regular review, and recent revisions include the introduction of the NOx charge since 2020, and the increase in the CO2 charges this year, both of which significantly incentivise the uptake of lower-emitting vehicles. \u00a0Reviews of the VRT system will continue as part of future Finance Bills, in line with the Government's Climate Action Plan, which incentivises the decarbonisation of the transport sector.<\/p><p>Finally, apart from the VRT arrangements, the Deputy will wish to note that, in accordance with EU law, vehicles imported from third countries are generally also subject to customs duties and VAT.\u00a0 Also, a new means of transport (i.e. a vehicle that is 6 months old or less, or has travelled 6,000kms or less) is subject to VAT when brought into the State from another part of the EU.\u00a0 Revenue informs me that VAT rules in relation to importations are established and agreed at EU level. There is extremely limited scope for adjustments to these regulations at a national level, and as a consequence, VAT will continue to apply to non-EU imports and intra-EU new means of transport, including hybrids and battery electric vehicles.<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s website provides information for individuals who plan to import a vehicle and guidance for them on the tax arrangements that apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400061#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":251,"content":"<p>Question No. 147 answered with Question No. 146.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400061#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[22030\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400061#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of income tax that is collected from persons under 30 years of age and from persons under 35 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that, for 2019, the most recent year for which complete data are available, the aggregate amount of Income Tax paid by persons aged under 30 and 35 has been estimated to be as shown in the below table.\u00a0 The equivalent figures in respect of the Universal Social Charge are also included in the table.\u00a0<\/p><p>For income tax, in the case of jointly assessed taxpayers, the age of the assessable spouse was used. <table>    <tr>       <th>Age<\/th>       <th>Aggregate Income Tax paid <br \/><br \/>&euro;bn<\/th>       <th>Aggregate USC paid <br \/><br \/>&euro;bn<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Under 30<\/td>       <td>1.5<\/td>       <td>0.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Under 35<\/td>       <td>3.4<\/td>       <td>0.7<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400061#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400061#WRG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[22250\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400061#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of secondments from his Department to the university third level sector over the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that there have been no secondments from my Department to the university third level sector over the past two years.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s secondments follow the guidelines set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Secondment Policy for the Civil Service.

Where a public servant is fully insured, their occupational pension is integrated with the State Pension i.e. account is taken of any social welfare benefits payable as part of an individual's overall public service pension entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual's public service pension is integrated, they may have an entitlement to a\u00a0bridging payment (known as the occupational supplementary pension) which\u00a0is required to ensure an individual&rsquo;s overall public service pension entitlement because there can be a shortfall in this benefit in certain circumstances e.g. because\u00a0an individual\u00a0has\u00a0not reached State Pension age.<\/p>  <p>  An occupational supplementary pension ensures that the occupational pension of a public servant paying Class A PRSI, when combined with any social insurance benefits, is equal to the occupational pension of a\u00a0public servant who pays modified PRSI (Class B, C or D) and whose pension is not integrated with the State Pension.<\/p>  <p>  However, the payment of a supplementary pension is not automatic and is subject to meeting certain criteria e.g. the individual\u00a0must have reached minimum pension age in accordance with the rules of his\/her scheme and must not be in paid employment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, it\u00a0is usually an important requirement that\u00a0individuals engage with the Department of Social Protection (DSP)\u00a0to ensure\u00a0that they are receiving any and all social insurance benefits to which they may have an entitlement.\u00a0The conditions around the payment of these benefits and the accrual of Social Welfare credits is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be\u00a0noted that there is no requirement for an individual to apply for any means-tested social welfare payments in order to qualify for a supplementary pension. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of claiming occupational supplementary pensions while living\u00a0abroad, my understanding is that non-residency does not generally preclude payment of the supplementary pension subject to adherence to the relevant DSP requirements. Similarly, there is no restriction preventing an individual participating in a course of education (e.g. a third level course).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the\u00a0conditions for the payment of supplementary pensions are similar across the wider public service, including, for example, the education and health sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400062#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400062#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[21681\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400062#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if information regarding the allocation of funds from the National Lottery is readily available to the public; the location in which the details of allocations to charitable organisations can be obtained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>Funding raised by the National Lottery plays a very important role in supporting a range of good causes at national, regional and community level.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has no direct involvement in the allocation of National Lottery Good Causes funding.

In addition to a common focus on policy goals and outcomes, both initiatives also have an explicit focus on people&rsquo;s experiences and how the impact of public policy can differ between groups of people.\u00a0 These differences have the potential to support and inform the policy process by providing a more refined description of the policy challenge, articulating clearer policy goals and identifying who may benefit from more targeted policy interventions. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Beginning with a pilot programme introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, Equality Budgeting is a way of approaching and understanding the budget as a process that embodies long-standing societal choices about how resources are used, rather than simply a neutral process of resource allocation. In practice, this means that equality budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  Equality objectives and indicators are published every year in the REV\u00a0and the Public Service Performance Report.\u00a0 The initial focus of Equality Budgeting was on gender, following which the initiative was extended to other dimensions of equality such as socio-economic inequality, disability, minority groups etc. <\/p>  <p>  An Expert Advisory Group was established to guide development of Equality Budgeting policy, and has\u00a0met regularly since\u00a0September 2018. In 2019, the OECD published a report on Equality Budgeting in Ireland, providing 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. Implementation of the report's recommendations is now at an advanced stage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with the OECD recommendation to develop an equalities data strategy, the CSO completed a data audit in cooperation with my Department, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. A report on this audit was published in October 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In order to support the continuing development of performance budgeting in Ireland, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has been successful in its application to the EU&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP). The project that the EU is funding under this Programme is providing Ireland with the opportunity to work with technical experts from the EU and OECD as well as other international experts in order to take stock of how effectively performance budgeting has been working and to consider future directions for ongoing reform drawing on international best practice (e.g., enhance accountability and transparency, upgrade existing budgeting and financial management systems and processes). This project also takes cognisance of the other reform initiatives (e.g., equality budgeting, green budgeting, and well-being budgeting).<\/p>  <p>  An inter-departmental group has also been established for Equality Budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government departments.

Pre-existing Public Service Pension Schemes <\/p>  <p>  These schemes apply\u00a0to those who joined the public service prior to 2013. It is a condition of the majority of these schemes that the member make a pension contribution towards the cost of retirement benefits for the full period of his or her scheme membership. <\/p>  <p>  That continues to be the case even if the member serves in excess of 40 years, which in the standard pre-existing pension schemes is the maximum period of pensionable service that is allowed in the calculation of pension benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that these schemes are defined benefit schemes, which means that benefits are based on a defined calculation formula (e.g. 1\/80th and 3\/80ths of final pensionable remuneration for retirement pension and lump sum, respectively, for public servants in modified PRSI class) rather than on the contributions made by or on behalf of the individual.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the value of superannuation benefits for the individual continues to increase beyond the 40 year threshold as increments, promotion or pay increases (occurring after 40 years&rsquo; service) are reflected in the pension and superannuation lump sum ultimately payable on retirement.<\/p>  <p>  Refunds of excess contributions are possible in respect of public service spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s contributory pension schemes, which provide dependents&rsquo; benefits in case of the death of the member either during service or following retirement. These refunds apply\u00a0where reckonable service is given in excess of 40 years &ndash; such refunds relate to contributions made in the earlier part of one&rsquo;s career.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Single Public Service Pension Scheme individuals who joined the public service from 2013 onwards are\u00a0 members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme. This\u00a0is a Career Average Defined Benefit scheme, with member pension and lump-sum benefits (known as &lsquo;referable amounts&rsquo;) building up on the basis of pensionable remuneration received by members in a pay-period. The member pays employee contributions in each pay-period. This\u00a0continues to be\u00a0the case until such time as a member retires.<\/p>  <p>  In the Single Scheme, the same concept of maximum reckonable service (i.e. 40 years) does not exist. There is, however, a mandatory retirement age of 70 for the majority of members, with lower ages for certain members of uniformed grades\u00a0and other cohorts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400062#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400062#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[22256\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400062#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the details of secondments from his Department to the university third level sector over the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are currently\u00a0two staff members from my Department seconded out to administrative roles\u00a0in the\u00a0third level sector.

Furthermore, in January 2022, I published a new Design Manual for Quality Housing and a Review of the Pre-Construction Processes undertaken in cooperation with the local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) sectors.\u00a0These initiatives are important to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and pace of delivery of social homes.<\/p><p>The table below outlines the social housing capital projects by local authority which are currently in the pre-construction process including assessment\/approval by my Department. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority <\/th>       <th>Number of Projects <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City<\/td>       <td>6 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County<\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City<\/td>       <td>5 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City<\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County<\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick <\/td>       <td>9 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon <\/td>       <td>4 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin<\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow <\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>64<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of\u00a0construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.\u00a0 This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements (P&amp;amp;A).\u00a0The table below sets<\/p><p>out details of projects with my Department for approval.\u00a0The average time for the approval of a CALF project is six weeks. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority<\/th>       <th>Number of Projects<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City<\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County<\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City<\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath <\/td>       <td>2 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin<\/td>       <td>3 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total <\/td>       <td>22 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400064#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[21852\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400064#WRK02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total amount spent on HAP, RAS, rent supplement and leasing programmes in 2021;

Both the Help to Buy incentive and the Local Authority Home Loan are already available and can be availed of by eligible applicants for the purpose of constructing a self-build home.<\/p>  <p>  Information on the Help to Buy scheme can be found at the following link: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/help-to-buy-incentive\/index.aspx\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Information on the Local Authority Home Loan can be found at the following link: localauthorityhomeloan.ie\/<\/p>  <p>  In relation to social housing, my Department is supporting Local Authorities in the delivery of a range of social housing schemes from small to larger scale developments. This includes single rural dwellings where the Authorities concerned have prioritised such projects as part of their overall work to meet their social housing targets and respond to local housing need.\u00a0It is open to any person who is qualified for social housing support to apply to the relevant Local Authority in connection with the provision of a home or site. However, the actual operation of such an approach to social housing provision continues to be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of new housing provision in rural towns, the Government's\u00a0Housing For All strategy includes the &lsquo;Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe&rsquo; (Towns) Fund. This will be delivered by Local Authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, in order to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns in a sustainable way. This reflects the priorities of the National Planning Framework by activating the potential for the renewal and development of small towns and villages by focusing on compact urban growth. The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is currently under development, including the scope and appropriate timeframes, and it is expected that a call for proposals will issue to Local Authorities shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400066#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400066#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22173\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400066#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he can elaborate further on the review of the income eligibility for social housing submitted to his Department by the Housing Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 343 of\u00a022 March 2022.

Several of the foreshore licences issued over the past 24 months linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects have been the subject of judicial review proceedings and the process for assessing such applications has been amended as a result, taking into account legal advices received. Over the last eighteen months, my Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the Foreshore Section to address this increasing workload. This should reduce the average time taken to assess an application. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants is in operation to assist in the technical assessment of applications. Recognising the increasing complexity and volume of applications being received; the importance of expediting the advancement of activities to assist in achieving our Climate Action Plan targets, as well as the competition for what is a limited pool of technical expertise in this area, my Department is exploring how it can further expand the technical expertise available to it to meet these demands. I believe that these changes will combine to make the assessment process more robust, will reduce the number of\u00a0stages required\u00a0as part of\u00a0the assessment process and as a result should reduce the time required to assess an application, while noting the variables which can influence the time taken to assess and\u00a0determine\u00a0a foreshore licence application. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the\u00a0validation process and tendering for independent consultants referred to in the Question, both are\u00a0part of the\u00a0internal administrative procedures operated by my Department as part of the preparation for the various statutory assessments that must be conducted in accordance with\u00a0the range of relevant legislation.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than county or country of residence of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service. <\/p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius, Lesotho, Colombia, Panama, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in \"Passport Express\" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and Passport Express very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround.  <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service currently operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan and the third in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed. The printing system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity. Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour. I am satisfied that the printing capacity of production equipment currently employed by the Passport Service is sufficient to meet the current and anticipated future demand for passports. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service is currently working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly. My Department has also recently updated its website, including a new Passport Service section where applicants can easily find out with documents are required for their type of application. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants and that the service improvements, both those recently introduced as well as those planned, allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400068#WRO00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":506,"content":"<p>Question No. 233 answered with Question No. 224.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[21942\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400068#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update on a passport application by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service regrets the delay in processing this application.

In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature. <\/p><p>It is stated in a note to the witness on the Identity and Consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature.

Whilst the Passport Service makes every effort to contact the Garda station in these cases, unfortunately, the passport application may be delayed. In some cases, the applicant may be requested to submit a new witnessed form where the Passport Service has been unable to contact the Garda station. A new document management system that was put in place at the beginning of March is ensuring that these applications which require further documents are being turned around within 15 working days of receipt of the additional documents. <\/p><p>The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously.

Satisfactory security guarantees and concrete and specific agreements need to be arranged and implemented if genuine humanitarian corridors are to function effectively, including evacuation of civilians from Mariupol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP01600"},{"type":"question","counter":546,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[22251\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of secondments from his Department to the university third level sector over the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":547,"content":"<p>There were no secondments from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the third level sector over the past two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP01900"},{"type":"question","counter":549,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[22326\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide a schedule of fines and totality of the amount paid in respect of fines issued by the EU on his Department for failing to transpose EU directives; if he will include the directive that was not transposed on time; and if he will indicate the directives that are still not fully transposed for the past 25 years to date in 2022.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":550,"content":"<p>There have been no fines issued by the EU on my Department for failure to transpose EU directives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP02200"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[21801\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400069#WRP02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will consider rolling out a noise amelioration grants programme for residents of Rathcoole, County Dublin similar to that which is available to UK residents near military airfield given that Rathcoole is located directly below the take and approach surfaces of runway 04 for Casement airdrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":553,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that Casement aerodrome is the only operational military installation in the State and has been in operation since 1917.

A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I am very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on what has been a long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for these staff under grant schemes, and that where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  On that basis, there has been extensive engagement between my Department and school management bodies to work towards a resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the willingness of F&oacute;rsa and in particular the school secretary representatives for their constructive engagement in this process, and to recognise the support of Minister McGrath and his officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at all stages of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The final element of the package will introduce standardised arrangements in respect of annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.<\/p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement will include a complex process of assimilating each individual secretary to the new terms and conditions which will vary depending on individual circumstances.

RSE is required at all levels in schools, from primary through to Senior Cycle. <\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy. \u00a0In addition, schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focussing on a range of topics including healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.<\/p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing an updated curriculum materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. <\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus\u00a0of the NCCA work has been\u00a0on creating support materials for teachers as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit.

It will enable us to maintain the high standards and quality that we need to continue to achieve in our schools to serve our students well. It is vital that the form of assessment we use both reflects excellence in standards and truly enables all students to showcase their abilities.<\/p>  <p>  Bearing in mind the significant assessment load at the end of sixth year, as an interim measure I have asked the SEC to immediately alter the timing of Paper One in both Irish and English so that Paper One would take place at the end of fifth year commencing for fifth years entering fifth year in September 2023. <\/p>  <p>  In making this announcement, I have responded to a broad consensus for spreading the assessment load. In this regard, the NCCA Advisory Report emphasised the need to reduce the focus on the final examination period and the stress experienced by students associated with this time.<\/p>  <p>  Since September last, the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has held a number of hearings on Senior Cycle reform. Throughout these hearings, a desire to spread assessment over a greater period has been a recurring theme on which there has been broad consensus.<\/p>  <p>  I have also listened to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which made a number of concluding observations in its 2016 periodic report on Ireland.\u00a0 The Committee expressed its concern about the pressure that the Leaving Certificate examination places on children and recommended that Ireland consider reforming the Leaving Certificate to reduce the stress caused to children.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, I have also listened to students themselves who have called for the spread of assessment and striking a balance between final exams and other forms of assessment.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said, altering the timing of Paper One in Irish and English is an interim measure designed to spread the assessment load and thereby reduce the stress experienced by students, pending the full development of a variety of examination components in all subjects. It should also be noted that the weighting and importance of Paper One in each of the subjects has not been changed or reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA will publish in September 2023 a schedule of subject specification reviews which will provide the roadmap through which all subject specifications beyond those being introduced in September 2024 will be given effect. The revision of the English specifications\u00a0through this process will allow for a fundamental consideration of the appropriate assessment approach to be taken at that time and which has regard to the introduction of teacher assessment for all subjects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400072#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400072#WRS03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":679,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400072#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":680,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[22054\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400072#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of Ukrainian households that have entered the State since the start of the war; and the breakdown by household size, for example, no children, one child, two, three and four or more children.","asker":"1468","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":681,"content":"<p>As of 29th April 2022 the latest figures from my Department show that 27,346 PPS numbers have been provided to refugees arriving in Ireland from Ukraine.

According to CSO figures, the rate of active supplementary pension coverage is around 56% of the working population (Pension Coverage Survey 2021).  It is estimated that this could be as low as 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  As a consequence of this low supplementary pension coverage rate, many retirees may suffer an unwanted reduction in living standards when they retire and have to rely entirely on the State Pension.<\/p>  <p>  The new AE system, which is expected to become operational in early 2024, will automatically enrol approximately 750,000 employees at the outset.

It recommended that long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years) should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring.  The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory \"Family Carer Register\" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  In this regard, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400073#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400073#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[21774\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400073#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason that applicants for passports and driving licences are still being asked to produce a public services card for the processing of same though no social-protection function applies in the matter of either; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>Since its inception in the late 1990s, the Public Services Card (PSC) has always been intended as a physical token of identity to be used in transactions between the citizens and the State, not just between citizens and my Department.<\/p><p>One of my functions as Minister for Social Protection is the authentication of the identity, as set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.<\/p><p>Once a person has successfully authenticated their identity in one of my offices, they are issued with a PSC which can be used as proof of identity when transacting with certain public bodies (&ldquo;specified bodies&rdquo;) listed in that Act.

The role of the service support worker is crucial in providing these services.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to your question on behalf of Kilbarrack Coastal Community Programme (KCCP) regarding difficulty experienced recruiting CE participants as youth support and drug rehabilitation support workers. Where vacancies occur on CE schemes, eligible candidates are identified by my Department&rsquo;s activation services and are referred to fill placements on CE schemes. Jobseekers can also register their interest through www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service website or by contacting a case officer in their local Intreo Centre. CE candidates are then referred to the CE scheme once their eligibility has been confirmed and CE is considered a suitable activation measure for that jobseeker.  Referrals are being made to KCCP by the Department's activation service; however, some of the candidates referred unfortunately have not been deemed suitable for the specific roles.<\/p>  <p>  In order to support CE schemes and to assist with the transition from COVID emergency supports, Minister Humphreys and I have put transitionary measures in place whereby participants, including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, until a suitable replacement has been   referred to the scheme.  This provision will support schemes to retain services, given the higher-than-normal turnover of participants in 2022.  Any extension under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the impact of COVID on the recruitment of participants, services provided by schemes, along with recruitment and referral efforts.  I understand that one such extension is currently under consideration in respect of the KCCP CE scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these flexibilities will ensure services provided by CE schemes will continue to be supported, as we phase out COVID emergency supports while ensuring that CE places remain  available to long term unemployed persons within communities.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400074#WRU03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400075#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[22258\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400075#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the details of secondments from her Department to the university third level sector over the past two years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>There have been no secondments from the Department of Social Protection to the university third level sector in the past 2 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400075#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":768,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400075#WRV00500"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[22295\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400075#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the current contracts for the provision of local employment and job clubs services have been extended until the end of August 2022; the number of times that deadlines have been extended in this process; the reason that it has been extended on this occasion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>The provision of contracted employment service provision has been under review by my Department for some time with extensive consultation taking place with the sector since late 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department had initially planned that the two phased procurement process for the new Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Service would be completed in 2021, with new services commencing in January 2022.

However there are real, material limits on the immediate increases that can be accommodated on highly practical courses such as healthcare courses which involve clinical placements.<\/p>  <p>  In the longer term, the Programme for Government commits the Department of Health to working with the education sectors, regulators, and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service.

In this regard, there has been significant implementation of many of the relevant recommendations, sometimes to a greater extent than that envisaged by the Review, in the intervening period. Such improvements were effected through amendments to the Coroners Act 1962 in 2005, 2011, 2013, 2019 and 2020 as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005 ended the restriction on the number of medical witnesses allowed at inquest.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provided for the restructuring and amalgamation of coronial districts. Coroner districts within counties have been amalgamated as the opportunities have arisen. There were 48 districts in 2000, this has reduced to 38 in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provided for legal aid and legal advice by certification by the coroner to the Legal Aid Board in relation to inquests.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 clarified, strengthened and modernised coroner&rsquo;s powers in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths. The scope of enquires at inquest was expanded beyond being limited to establishing the medical cause of death, to seeking to establish, to the extent the coroner considers necessary, the circumstances in which the death occurred. The Act also broadened the coroner&rsquo;s powers relating to mandatory reporting and inquest of maternal deaths, deaths in custody or childcare situations and significant new powers to compel witnesses and evidence at inquest.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 provided, among other items, for the assignment and appointment of temporary coroners to act simultaneously with other coroners in exceptional circumstances to be utilised as part of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to reform of the Coroner Service, the Coroners Bill 2007, incorporated many of the more than 100 recommendations contained in the 2000 Review. It also had regard to the proposals of the Rules Committee. However, due to the major challenges then confronting public finances, the administrative restructuring proposed in the 2007 Bill was not progressed following Second Stage in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400077#WRX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":878,"content":"<p>Question No. 359 answered with Question No. 358.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Inquiries","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400078#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[21675\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400078#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the inquiry for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[22232\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400078#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the inquiry into the conduct and adequacy of the investigations conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the death of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":883,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 402 together.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the distress caused to the Tuohey family as they await the conclusion of the Inquiry relating to the investigations into the death of Shane. <\/p><p>Unfortunately, as the Deputy may be aware, Judge McDonagh informed me that he was unable to continue with the work of the Inquiry due to personal reasons.

The Programme was introduced at a time when Ireland was going through a very significant economic downturn and Departments were tasked with initiating innovative programmes to attract investment and create employment as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.<\/p><p>The criteria applied when assessing applications under the IIP is set out in the guidance published on my Department's immigration website at:\u00a0I want to invest in Ireland - Immigration Service Delivery (irishimmigration.ie).<\/p><p>Successful\u00a0applicants under the Programme\u00a0and their nominated family members\u00a0are granted a residence permission in Ireland under Stamp 4 conditions. Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work,\u00a0study or\u00a0start their own businesses in Ireland.<\/p><p>Successful applicants granted a permission under the IIP must then apply for a D reside visa, if visa required, to travel to the State. This is a separate process to the IIP application and it should be noted that not all persons approved are visa required nationals. I can also confirm that no residence permission has been given to any IIP applicant in the absence of the approved investment being made.<\/p><p>Given the significant immigration benefits accruing\u00a0to successful applicants under the programme all such persons are subject to rigorous screening by my Department as to their suitability during the application process. This screening includes due diligence and sanction checks in respect of applicants, and reputable international databases are accessed for this purpose, as and when required, to ensure that only reputable individuals are eligible for permission. These rigorous checks are aimed at protecting the integrity of the programme and the State&rsquo;s interests.<\/p><p>All projects which IIP applicants are investing in are also examined in great detail by an Independent Evaluation Committee comprising key officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland who have appropriate corporate expertise in this area. This examination process involves an assessment of the commercial viability of the project; employment outcomes associated with the proposed investment; and the overall benefit to the Irish State. The Committee makes a determination as to whether a project is suitable for IIP investment and if deemed suitable, the individual application will be submitted to me\u00a0for final approval.<\/p><p>In addition, IIP permissions are renewable at years two and five and specific monitoring mechanisms and reporting obligations apply in this regard. Where the specific criteria are not being met, renewal of permissions will be refused.<\/p><p>All immigration related programmes are kept under constant review to ensure their effectiveness and appropriateness, taking into consideration international and EU level developments. In 2019, an audit of the IIP identified a number actions to be undertaken, including a strategic review of the IIP. Following a tender process, a contract to carry out an external review was signed in June 2019. This review was to be carried out in two phases. The Terms of Reference for the review are published at: .<\/p><p>The second phase of the review has been completed and is being considered by my Department. In the meantime, applications under the IIP continue to be assessed by the independent evaluation committee and, where assessed positively, are accepted and processed.<\/p><p>My Department does not currently publish the details of individual approved IIP investments; however, this matter is currently under consideration.

This may be followed by the exposure of the child to sexual images or content.\u00a0Section 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a specific offence of using information and communications technology to communicate with a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation.\u00a0The offence allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring to justice online predators and carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.\u00a0This is in recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity so as to facilitate the production of pornography or to meet the child for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that child trafficking and exploitation (including the production of child pornography) are criminalised under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended by Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 amended the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 to raise the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 years from 5 to 7 years imprisonment.\u00a0Furthermore, the 2017 Act amended the 2006 Act to raise the maximum penalty for attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years from 2 to 7 years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, as amended, also provides that the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years is life imprisonment and the same penalty applies to attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (known as the \"Lanzarote Convention\") on 21 December 2020. The Convention entered into force in relation to Ireland on 1 April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 of The Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which strengthens the law relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, and criminalises the use of information and communication technology to facilitate such exploitation, ensures the State&rsquo;s full compliance with criminal law provisions in the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2019 introduces, inter alia, stricter penalties for repeat sexual offenders. The Act provides that where an offender is convicted of a sexual offence listed in a new schedule to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 (including a number of sexual offences against children) and is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of at least 5 years and is subsequently &ndash; within a period of 10 years &ndash; convicted of a further scheduled offence, the court shall, when imposing sentence for that offence, specify a term of imprisonment to be served by the person, that is no less than three quarters of the maximum penalty for the offence.<\/p>  <p>  Where the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, the Court shall impose a sentence of not less than 10 years imprisonment. However, the court has discretion not to apply the minimum sentence if it is satisfied that this would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.<\/p>  <p>  While there are currently no new legislative measures being advanced in relation to child sexual abuse, I am of course committed to ensuring the law in this area is comprehensive and effective. As such, it is constantly kept under review and if further changes are identified as being needed, these will be brought forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Speech","counter":1021,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1022,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[22354\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps, legislative or otherwise, her Department will take to give effect to the recent recommendation issued by the European Commission on protecting journalists and human rights defenders who engage in public participation from SLAPP suits; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1023,"content":"<p>Firstly, I want to acknowledge the recent launch by Vice-President Jourov&aacute;, of the European Commission&rsquo;s package of proposed measures to combat SLAPPs - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation - and the work undertaken by the Commission in this area.<\/p>  <p>  This refers to the strategic and abusive use by a powerful entity of vexatious litigation, to weaken and deter public interest discussion (and in particular, investigative journalism).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to distinguish between the two main elements of the Commission's anti-SLAPP package, a Commission Recommendation to Member States, and a proposal for a Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is referring to the Recommendation, which is not legally binding, and provides guidelines, or suggestions, on a range of possible legislative and non-legislative measures that could be introduced at national level, to be considered by Member States.\u00a0My Department officials are analysing the detail of the Recommendation, and will, of course, be examining carefully those suggestions that would fall within my responsibility as Minister for Justice.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 March 2022, the Government agreed to publish the Report of the Review of the Defamation Act 2009, carried out by my Department, and to prepare amending legislation in this area.

My Department is now commencing work on preparing the General Scheme of the amending Defamation Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Review Report, which has been published on my Department's website, specifically addresses the issue of SLAPPs and recommends, in particular, a number of measures to:<\/p>  <p>  -  avoid disproportionate awards in defamation cases and support more consistent, proportionate and predictable redress;\u00a0and<\/p>  <p>  -  provide clearer protection for responsible public interest journalism and investigative reporting.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the Defamation Report&rsquo;s main recommendations include that the law be amended to introduce a new &lsquo;anti-SLAPP&rsquo; mechanism, to allow a person to apply to the court for summary dismissal of defamation proceedings that he\/she believes are a SLAPP. Such action would, of course, go beyond the scope of the Commission&rsquo;s proposed Directive, which is limited to cases with cross-border implications between EU Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a new &lsquo;anti-SLAPP&rsquo; mechanism, as proposed by the Report, would also allow the court to award full legal costs to a person who was found to be the target of a SLAPP action, against the entity that had initiated the SLAPP proceedings, where the court considered this appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1024,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1025,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[22100\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400081#WRBB03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the fact that funeral directors in Ireland do not communicate to bereaved families the updated HSE guidelines dated May 2021 on the care of the deceased in circumstances in which Covid-19 has been a contributory factor in their death;

Therefore, not all deaths registered within a quarter would have occurred in the same quarter. \u00a0Legally in Ireland a period of three months is allowed to register a death.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 May 2021, the Health Service Executive (HSE) IT systems suffered a major ransomware attack.\u00a0 As a result of this, civil registrations with the GRO (including death registrations) could not be processed for a period of approximately five to six weeks.\u00a0 This resulted in a significant reduction in registrations recorded in Quarter 2 2021 (April-June).\u00a0 The CSO&rsquo;s Vital Statistics release for Quarter 2 2021 (issued 26 November 2021) reported that the number of births registered in Quarter 2 decreased by 1,976 (14.6%) compared to the same period in 2020 and that the number of deaths registered decreased by 1,882 (21.9%). <\/p>  <p>  The backlog of civil registrations created by the cyber-attack disruption resulted in some registrations which should have occurred in Quarter 2 being delayed to Quarter 3 2021 (and given the significance of the disruption, may also impact on registrations recorded for Quarter 4 when that data is reported). The CSO&rsquo;s Vital Statistics release for Quarter 3 reported that the number of births registered increased by 2,270 (15.7%) compared to the same period in 2020 and the number of deaths registered increased by 1,054 (14.8%). \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Total deaths registered in Ireland in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2021 combined (14,865) was 5.3% lower than the same period in 2020 (15,693) and almost the same as the number of deaths registered in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2019 (14,877).<\/p>  <p>  In response to a query on this issue, the CSO has stated that &lsquo;On 14 May 2021, the Health Service Executive (HSE) of Ireland suffered a major ransom ware cyber-attack which caused all of its IT systems nationwide to be shut down. The General Register Office (GRO) is the central repository for records relating to births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths in Ireland. The GRO systems were also affected by this cyber-attack and consequently, the availability to register life events such as births, deaths and marriages was severely restricted and unavailable for a period of time. As a result, the number of births, deaths and marriages registered in Q2 2021 was lower than what it otherwise would have been had such a cyber-attack not occurred. This unavailability in Q2 2021, ceteris paribus, resulted in a spillover of registrations for such life events in Q3 2021.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  The significant delay caused in civil registrations due to the impact of the cyber-attack was debated in the Oireachtas on a number of occasions during 2021 (primarily in relation to birth registrations).<\/p>  <p>  Due to the impact of the cyber-attack on registration of deaths, analysis of mortality in 2021 will need to be based on data on deaths by date of occurrence. The CSO publishes annual data on deaths by date of occurrence.\u00a0 The latest data available at present is for 2020, however when 2021 data is published this will be analysed by the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  Data and trends in mortality in Ireland, including the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19, are closely monitored by the Department of Health including analysis of excess mortality. \u00a0Excess mortality is an epidemiological indicator which can provide information on the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies examining excess mortality in Ireland in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been published since 2020.<\/p>  <p>  A number of analyses of excess mortality have indicated that Ireland appears to have experienced lower excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic than many other countries in Europe and globally.<\/p>  <p>  -  An April 2022 analysis by HIQA (Descriptive analysis of COVID-19 epidemiological indicators and associated contextual factors in European countries) estimated that there were 2,019 excess deaths in Ireland between 2 March 2020 and 28 November 2021. The excess deaths occurred during a seven-week period from late March to mid-May 2020 and an eight-week period from early January to late February 2021. The two distinct peaks in excess mortality experienced by Ireland broadly corresponded with the peaks observed for recorded COVID-19 deaths. Throughout the study period, there was substantial variability in the magnitude and duration of peaks in excess mortality across European countries. Between mid- and late-2021, the excess mortality in Ireland was observed to be amongst the lowest in Europe. The analysis of excess mortality contained in the report was based on the data and approaches of EuroMOMO (a European mortality monitoring activity), which provides a long-standing and robust approach to the measurement of excess mortality.<\/p>  <p>  -  A study published in the Lancet in March 2022 (Estimating excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic analysis of COVID-19-related mortality, 2020&ndash;21) indicated that rates varied substantially in western Europe, with estimated rates in some countries almost as high as those for countries in other global regions. Ireland was among several European countries (including Iceland, Norway, and Cyprus) which had some of the lowest rates in the world, at less than 50 excess deaths per 100,000 population. Based on the Lancet publication, which does include a number of methodological caveats, Ireland had the third lowest estimated excess mortality rate amongst western European countries for the relevant study period (1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021).<\/p>  <p>  -  A number of factors may have contributed to lower excess mortality in Ireland, which include, but are not limited to, timely and appropriate institution of population-level public health protective measures, effective communication and buy-in of individuals to non-pharmaceutical interventions, the prioritised roll out, and uptake, of vaccination amongst those in the population most vulnerable to severe outcomes from COVID-19, as well as, potentially, demographic differences, such as the younger population in Ireland compared to other European countries. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and its agencies will continue to closely monitor data in relation to mortality and excess mortality in Ireland.\u00a0 The Department also engages with international organisations in their ongoing analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health, including mortality.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400085#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400085#WRFF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[21854\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400085#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the lack of services provided to a child (details supplied);

A health-led response to drug and alcohol use. New structures are being put in place to support the implementation of these priorities. The Department of Health has proposed broadening and deepening civil society representation on the oversight structures for implementing the national drugs strategy, in line with actions 39 and 44 of the strategy. A transparent process has been put in place to include additional representation of civil society organisations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Partnership between the statutory, community and voluntary sectors has been a major factor in the success of previous strategies and continues to be the cornerstone of the new strategy. The strategy recognises that there are a great variety of community and voluntary organisations and that their commitment and knowledge can build the capacity to respond to the use of drugs with flexibility and sensitivity. These organisations play a valuable role in promoting positive social change, in conjunction with service users, families and local communities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed that the civil society representatives on the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy, and on the six Strategic Implementation Groups, will form a civil society group on drugs. This will provide a stronger voice for civil society organisations in the implementation of the strategy. It is important to reiterate that there is no proposal to remove existing community and voluntary groups from the national oversight committee.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has had initial discussions with civil society organisations in relation to the role of the proposed civil society group on drugs. Feedback received is being considered and the proposal is being elaborated to take account of this feedback, for further consideration. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to working in partnership with civil society organisations in the implementation of the national drugs strategy and I believe the establishment of a civil society group can strengthen this engagement.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400086#WRGG03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Human Reproduction","counter":1226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1227,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[21930\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide public funding for IVF in 2023 (details supplied); the amount of funding that is being provided; the persons that will be eligible to access this treatment; and if treatment will be available within the public system rather than being outsourced to private operators.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1228,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, a commitment to &ldquo;introduce a publicly funded model of care for fertility treatment&rdquo; is included in the Programme for Government. The model of care for infertility was developed by my officials in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in order to ensure that infertility issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.<\/p>  <p>  This model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs), extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention. The completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of six Hospital Groups across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced, which will allow for a robust regulatory framework to be put in place.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the last point, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on March 23rd 2022 and has been referred to the Select Committee on Health for Third Stage. I am fully committed to progressing this important legislation as quickly as possible.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials will be continuing and intensifying engagement with NWIHP over the coming weeks in respect of the issues arising from commencing Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care and as such, no firm decisions have been made at this juncture in relation to, for instance, the ensuing budgetary requirements, relevant access and eligibility criteria which may be applied, or how exactly advanced AHR treatments will be provided.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":1229,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[21932\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason pacemakers cannot be checked in Cavan General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1231,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1233,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[21933\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the health technology assessments received by the corporate pharmaceutical unit in each of the years 2018 to 2021 and to date in 2022; the date of the HSE drugs group decision; the date of reimbursement in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1234,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drug schemes, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1236,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[21944\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will act to retain the speech and language therapist at a school (details supplied) being removed by the HSE in which there is an established relationship between therapist, children, parents and staff at the school instead of proposed plans to place children on a HSE waiting list with substantial waiting periods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1237,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":1238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[21952\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of submissions that his Department received through its three year review public consultation process of the abortion legislation; if he will provide a breakdown of the findings drawn from the public submissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health commenced the Review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 in line with statutory and Government commitments.

The Minister for Health has appointed Ms Marie O&rsquo;Shea B.L. as the independent Chair of the Review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":1241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1242,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[21953\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish the county of origin that the heart attack patient numbers derive from in the Irish heart attack audit national report 2017-2020; the total number of patients concerned; the actual transfer times for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1243,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[21954\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish the county of origin of heart attack patients highlighted in the Irish Heart Attack Audit National Report 2017-2020 (details supplied); the PCI lab that patients in the cohort were transferred to if any; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1244,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 482 and 483 together.<\/p>  <p>As PQ 21953\/22 and PQ 21954\/22 relate to the same subject matter, namely the Irish Heart Attack Audit (IHAA) National Report 2017-2020, I propose to take both PQs together in this response.<\/p>  <p>  The Heartbeat audit of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care was first developed in 2012 to assess the effectiveness and quality of the newly formed National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (NCP-ACS) STEMI optimal reperfusion service.

While the report does not provide information for individual counties, the data is presented according to each participating site. In addition, each participating hospital has the functionality to access and use its own data to support quality improvement initiatives and service developments. The IHAA Report is published by NOCA for the purposes of healthcare quality improvement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1245,"content":"<p>Question No. 483 answered with Question No. 482.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1246,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[21960\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the home help hours currently being offered to a person (details supplied) can be re-assessed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1248,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1250,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[21963\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400087#WRHH02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the percentage of the health budget that was allocated to disability services in the budget in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1251,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The focus of the detailed work done to date by the Department's Contraception Implementation Group has been working towards ensuring that the scheme will commence in August 2022.  <\/p><p>The Contraception Implementation Group meets on a monthly basis.  To date, in 2022, meetings have been held in  January, February, March and  April. Members of the Group have also met with counterparts in various relevant Divisions of the HSE, and with other stakeholders, to ensure that progress is being made in terms of planning for implementation.  <\/p><p>In terms of stakeholder consultations, it should also be noted that the recommendations of the JOC8 took into consideration the deliberations of the Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly on the matter. The Working Group on Contraception held a number of meetings with key stakeholders as part of its research, prior to publication of the Report. <\/p><p>More recently, my Department has held consultations and listening exercises with a large range of stakeholders, as part of the wider work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce and, separately, as part of wider work to review the National Sexual Health Strategy. Clear stakeholder feedback with regard to access to contraception is therefore duly taken into consideration in the development and progression of this scheme. <\/p><p>The contraception scheme was discussed at a recent meeting with medical representative organisations. Formal negotiations with the medical representative organisations and with those representing pharmacists will commence shortly. <\/p><p>Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to enable commencement of the scheme, which is currently scheduled for August 2022. This includes an allocation for training and certification for fitting, checks and removals of long-acting reversible contraception. The HSE is currently working on preparing to roll out these additional training supports in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners. <\/p><p>The scheme will provide for:<\/p><p>1. The cost of prescription contraception;<\/p><p>2. The cost of necessary consultations with GPs and other doctors to discuss suitable contraception for individual patients and to enable prescription of same;<\/p><p>3. The cost of fitting and\/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit\/remove same;<\/p><p>4. The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;<\/p><p>5. Provision of the wide range of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders will also be available through this scheme, to include contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception. <\/p><p>For items such as the contraceptive pill, these are typically prescribed at 6-month intervals. For LARCs, (e.g. IUS, IUD, implants, injections, patches and rings), where the fittings\/injections are carried out by healthcare professionals, fitting and removal appointments are also provided for separately, in addition to the consultations.  <\/p><p>The scheme will be open to all 17-25 year-olds ordinarily resident in Ireland.Patients will be eligible to avail of the scheme from their 17<sup>th<\/sup>birthday until the day prior to their 26<sup>th<\/sup>birthday.  <\/p><p>Work on the legislative framework for the scheme is ongoing, with the scheme to implemented by way of Regulations. The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming months, to be rolled in the month preceding and during the initial phase of scheme roll-out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400088#WRJJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1305,"content":"<p>Question No. 502 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1307,"content":"<p>Question No. 503 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1308,"content":"<p>Question No. 504 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1309,"content":"<p>Question No. 505 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1310,"content":"<p>Question No. 506 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1312,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[22050\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the unit in the HSE that has responsibility for the implementation of the roll-out of the free contraception programme in August 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1313,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive","counter":1314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1315,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[22052\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a property (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1316,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of the public healthcare property estate, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":1317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1318,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[22055\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022050400089#WRKK01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress that has been made by his Department in 2022 on the implementation of a National Traveller Health Action Plan as set out in the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1319,"content":"<p>The Department of Health acknowledges the severe health needs of Travellers, who die younger, have more illnesses, and are at greater risk of substance misuse and mental ill-health.
