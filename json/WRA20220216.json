As a percentage of household disposable income, household debt stood at 100 per cent in Q3 2021, an all-time series low. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of debt arrears, the Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics (available at www.centralbank.ie\/statistics\/data-and-analysis\/credit-and-banking-statistics\/mortgage-arrears) indicate there were 60,971 accounts in mortgage arrears of 30 days or more as at end-Q3 2021, with 47,681 accounts relating to Principal Dwelling House (PDHs), and 13,110 relating to Buy-to-lets (BTLs). The total arrears balance was &euro;2.83bn, with &euro;2.74bn relating to PDH accounts.<\/p>  <p>  Focussing on loans held by retail banks, the Non-Performing Loan ratio for lending to businesses was 8 per cent in 2021q3. <\/p>  <p>  On debt arrears broken down by individual financial institution, this information is not publically available from the Central Bank of Ireland, but to the extent this information is available it would be disclosed in the accounts of the relevant institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank does not currently have direct analysis published on the issue of potential increase in repayment burdens or arrears resulting from increases in interest rates. However, the recent Financial Stability Review highlights that half of the balances owed by Irish SMEs to the retail banks have fixed interest rates, meaning that sudden interest rate rises would only impact borrowing costs if or when loan facilities are renewed. In addition, a growing number of households have short-term fixed interest rates, which will provide initial protection against potential interest rate rises. <\/p>  <p>  To help ensure the sustainability of the macroeconomic environment, the Department monitors interest rate developments on an ongoing basis. As part of both the Budget and the Stability Programme Update, baseline interest rate expectations are incorporated into the forecasts. In additional the Department has also previously simulated the impact of different stylised shocks, such as interest rate shocks, as part of the sensitivity analysis of the forecasts.\u00a0 The most recent published example is in Budget 2020, which included a hypothetical monetary policy shock that assumed the ECB policy rate increases by 1 percentage point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600069#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600069#WRC04800"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[8583\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600069#WRC04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount raised by the Exchequer in each of the years since 2010 by the application of VAT on home energy heating bills, that is, electricity and gas; the projected figures, if actual figures are not available, for VAT returns from the rising bills over recent months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that traders are not required to identify the VAT yield generated from the supply of specific services on their VAT returns.

It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (10th February) by EWSS is over &euro;7.4 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.4 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;1 billion to 51,900 employers in respect of over 713,500 employees.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To be eligible for EWSS an employer must be able to demonstrate that its business has experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, the Government agreed the future of EWSS including its graduated exit strategy. These arrangements were subsequently enhanced in response to the public health situation, namely the extension of the enhanced rates of subsidy for a further two months (across December 2021 and January 2022) and the reopening of the scheme for certain businesses as announced on 9 and 21 December 2021 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 February 2022, for most businesses, including the taxi sector, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  For completeness and in the event that persons in the taxi sector are operating as a sole-trader, I would clarify that subject to meeting the requisite conditions, a sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer. As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not able to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees &ndash; and further, may not necessarily be paid via the payroll system unlike proprietary directors who are obliged to have PAYE operated on any payments made to them personally.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware on 21 January 2022, I announced that businesses availing of EWSS that were directly impacted by the public health regulations of December 2021 will continue to receive the enhanced rates of subsidy for the month of February and the graduated step-down in subsidy rates will be delayed by one month with such firms continuing to receive support under the scheme until 31 May 2022.

The tax will replace the Vacant Site Levy. <\/p>  <p>  The significant benefit of the tax is to incentivise the development of suitably zoned land across the State which has been the beneficiary of investment in servicing for housing construction.\u00a0 This includes lands in cities, towns and village centres which are vacant or idle where such lands are zoned for mixed use including residential. The tax measure, in conjunction with the ongoing review of development plans throughout the State to identify and zone housing land needed to meet statutory Housing Supply Targets will ensure that delivery of housing on zoned and serviced land is progressed. The tax will, when it comes into effect in 2024, be applied at an annual taxation rate of 3% of market value of the land to encourage use for appropriate development.<\/p>  <p>  The tax will apply to all land zoned for residential or a mix of uses including residential and which are serviced throughout all 31 local authorities, with certain lands excluded from scope.\u00a0The role of the local authorities is to identify the lands in scope via a mapping process commencing November 2022, which includes appeal provisions where the relevant landowner considers that a parcel of land does not meet the criteria for falling within the scope of the tax. After the publication of the final maps in December 2023, the tax will be managed by the Revenue Commissioners. The maps will be reviewed annually by local authorities to ensure they are up to date. The tax will remain as a charge on the land, will be applied annually and will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners, incentivising the development of the land-bank by the owners, or the sale of the land to those who will undertake development.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for inclusion on the map is land zoned in a Development Plan or Local Area Plan solely or primarily for residential use, or for a mixture of uses that includes residential use, where such lands are able to connect to the necessary infrastructure to enable housing development and for which there is capacity available. Zoned land subject to known issues relating to contamination or the presence of known archaeological or historic remains are to be excluded. There are certain exemptions specific to either residential or mixed use serviced land. For residential zoned land, these involve commercial uses which provide a service to the surrounding area and are liable for commercial rates. For lands zoned for a mixture of uses, including residential, the focus is on lands which are vacant or idle and not integral to any unauthorised use of the lands.\u00a0All other land use zonings are not within the scope of the tax. Existing dwellings and their gardens, while they will be included in the maps, are not included in the scope of the tax.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Landowners may also make submissions to local authorities during the public consultation periods on the maps to amend zonings to remove their lands from the scope of the tax, which could also reflect those lands which are not attracting development interest. In considering these submissions and the potential for varying the adopted development plan as a result, the local authorities must take into account the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and the need to zone sufficient land to meet the statutory Housing Supply Targets. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0notified all local authorities of the introduction of the tax measure on signing of the Finance Act 2021.\u00a0My Department is preparing guidance on the mapping process and the management of rezoning requests and is liaising with stakeholders through a working group. \u00a0Financial support and assistance to the local authorities will also be provided on this matter to ensure that the maps will be published as required by the legislation.\u00a0My Department\u00a0will bring forward separate transitionary legislation to repeal the vacant site levy arrangements and\u00a0this will take account of lands that might otherwise fall out of the full scope of the Vacant Site Levy, that are currently subject to the Vacant Site Levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00275","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[8643\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of officials in his Department at principal officer grade level or above.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>Of the 1,460 staff employed by my Department at 31 January 2022, there were 103 at principal officer\u00a0or equivalent grade level or above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00600"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[8704\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total number of staff employed in each local authority housing department, by employment type, including architects, engineers, clerical staff, maintenance staff and so on, in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[8705\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600071#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of unfilled vacancies in local authority housing departments, by employment type, in each local authority.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible. <\/p>  <p>  My Department oversees workforce planning for the local government sector, including the monitoring of local government sector employment levels.

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to that person.\u00a0 In order to meet this requirement, each passport applicant must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement when making a first time passport application. <\/p><p>An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 or born to a parent who was born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen.<\/p><p>The citizenship of persons born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the citizenship or residency status of one of their parents at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth. In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy in which both parents are non-Irish citizens, if neither of the parents are a British citizen, the citizenship of a child born in Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the residency status of one of the parents at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth. A child born on or after 1 January 2005 may claim citizenship by birth where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his\/her birth (a total of 1,095 days). <\/p><p>In order to prove this residency period of one of the parents when applying for a passport on behalf of their child, the parent must provide acceptable documentary evidence. The documents required to prove the residency period vary depending on whether the parent was an EU or non-EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth. <\/p><p>If the parent was an EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, it is necessary to rely on the following list of documents to prove the parent&rsquo;s residency in Ireland for three of the four years before the child&rsquo;s birth (not all of the documents on the list may be required in every case):<\/p><p>- Tax records (P60 \/ P45 \/ P35L \/ Employment Detail Summary) for each yearshowing at least 35 weeks insurable employment.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Notice of Assessment \/ Self Assessment records for each year and supportingdocumentation e.g. bank statements \/ domestic bills for each month<\/p><p>- Letter from Social Welfare\/Intreo confirming type of benefit payment received andthe dates to and from when the benefit was paid directly, this must beaccompanied by a photocopy of parent&rsquo;s PPS card front and back<\/p><p>- Rent Lease (must include contract page and signature of the parent whoseresidency is being considered) with receipts \/ utility bills\/ rent book toconfirm payments for each month<\/p><p>- Bank statementsfor each month showing regular transactions in and out of the account<\/p><p>- School\/college letters confirming dates of attendance, full time courses undertaken and proofof exam results<\/p><p>- Declaration Form A: This is a sworn statement by the parent, giving details of their period ofresidency in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p><p>If neither of the parents was an Irish, British or EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, one of the parents will be required to provide proof of residency in Ireland for three of the four years before the child&rsquo;s birth with the following original documents:<\/p><p>- Original national passport of the parent showing residency stamps for 3 of theprevious 4 years before the child is born. Expired passports can besubmitted.<\/p><p>- Parent&rsquo;s Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) card\u00a0\/ Irish ResidencePermit (IRP) card.<\/p><p>- A summary statement, signed by parent of parent&rsquo;s &lsquo;permission to remain&rsquo;stamps in the passport. The summary should include:<\/p><p>- Number of the passport.<\/p><p>- Name of passport holder.<\/p><p>- Description of the stamp(s).<\/p><p>- Dates of the permission.<\/p><p>In addition to the documents outlined above, all first time child applications require the submission of:<\/p><p>- Guardianship documents (if required). <\/p><p>- Full original civil birth certificate.<\/p><p>Information on what is required for all first time passport applications, including details on documentary requirements, guardianship and consent, are available at my Department&rsquo;s recently updated website (<i>www.dfa.ie\/passports\/documentary-requirements\/<\/i>). <\/p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children.\u00a0First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this:<\/p><p>- As outlined above, it is important for the Passport Service to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5<sup>th<\/sup>in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. This is something we can all be proud of. However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect theintegrity of the Irish passport, the Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.\u00a0<\/p><p>- In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians.<\/p><p>Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct.\u00a0 Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required adding to the processing time.<\/p><p>I strongly urge parents to carefully read the documentary requirements on my Department&rsquo;s website and to apply for passports for their children online in plenty of time.

The decision to make these changes to the examination papers has been taken to provide the Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with certainty and clarity.

Following their consideration of\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.\u00a0 The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on\u00a0the education section of the gov.ie website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600072#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600072#WRF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[8641\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600072#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 131 of 1 February 2022 and 87 of 9 February 2022, and related press statement issued from her Department, if her Department has decided the location for the school (details supplied); her views on whether this relocation of an existing school onto the campus of another school is planning exempt as claimed in the recent press statement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>A site visit\u00a0took place on 31 January 2022 with the\u00a0purpose\u00a0of identifying on the ground\u00a0the practical matters which need to be addressed to accommodate both schools.\u00a0 This includes addressing the possibility of the provision of SEN facilities in both schools for the coming school year.\u00a0 In considering available space on the campus of the other school site, this development can be considered exempt under the planning exemption introduced in March 2021 - Planning and Development (Exempted Development) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 114 of 2021) &ndash; School Buildings.<\/p>  <p>  My Department officials have endeavoured to keep both school authorities informed and will continue to do so as the details of this option are developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600072#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Amalgamation","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600072#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[8690\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600072#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the amalgamation of schools (details supplied) will not proceed until the new campus and facilities are fully ready to receive the students; when same will occur; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1485","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy, that my Department approved the amalgamation of the three post primary schools in question following an application from the schools' Patrons.

Actions in Nurturing Skills to develop career pathways and promote careers in the sector will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment, to make the sector more attractive to potential workers.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key pillars of Nurturing skills is raising qualification levels in the workforce. To achieve this objective, actions in the plan include providing funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) for early years educators and level 5 for SAC practitioners, and providing financial support to service providers to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. My Department will be working collaboratively with both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to deliver this objective.<\/p>  <p>  A key enabler for Nurturing Skills is the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services.

The new funding model marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has ensured an additional &euro;78m for ELC and SAC, which will support my Department to introduce a range of new measures in the upcoming year. The Expert Group report informed this package of measures for the sector. The report emphasises the importance of a unified approach across the sector &ndash; both Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare &ndash; and this will be applied in the new funding model.<\/p>  <p>  Among these measures are reforms to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which will be of significant benefit to many parents. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, the practice of deducting hours spent in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours will be discontinued in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Where both parents in a household are in work or study, eligible families can receive a subsidy for up to 45 hours per week and, for households where a parent is not in work or study, they can receive up to 20 hours per week of subsidy. Currently, where a child is in ECCE or school, these hours are subtracted from their entitlement to NCS subsidised hours. <\/p>  <p>  With the change announced in Budget 2022, parents will be able to avail of all NCS subsidised hours regardless of time spent in school or ECCE. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that this will benefit an estimated 5,000 children from low-income families. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the NCS universal subsidy will be extended to all families with children under 15 years of age. This is a significant expansion of the NCS, as currently the universal subsidy is available to children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months, and is payable for a child who is older than 36 months but does not yet qualify for ECCE. The extension of the universal subsidy will benefit up to 40,000 children. <\/p>  <p>  These changes to the NCS were will increase the overall number of subsidised hours available to families with school-aged children, and may make SAC a more attractive option for parents.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, a new Core Funding stream will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. Core Funding will be available to registered ELC and SAC providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The new Core Funding stream for both ELC and SAC services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability and the establishment of an Employment Regulation Order, will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022 and up to &euro;207 million from 2023 on. Participation in Core Funding will require services not to increase fees to parents from the September 2021 rates.<\/p>  <p>  The calculation of the value of Core Funding to an individual provider will be predominantly based on the level of capacity that they commit to offering during the contract period, meaning providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver. The value of Core Funding to a provider will also depend on the qualifications of those working in the service.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, to support services during the period between the phasing out of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of the new Core Funding stream in September. <\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group's report also addressed the role that ELC and SAC can play in contributing to tackling disadvantage and made a series of recommendations on how the funding model can support this goal through a combination of universal and targeted measures for services operating in the context of disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 began the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. Full implementation of all recommendations will be progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  I would also add that the Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to ELC and SAC services experiencing difficulties. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the Case Management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600073#WRG06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":392,"content":"<p>Question No. 173 answered with Question No. 172.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[8696\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the way the once-off transition fund works for after-school services; if it will be based on the EWSS model; how the core funding will work; the criteria for core funding; what based on capacity rather than attendance means in terms of core funding; and if the services will still get individual payments for children through NCS.","asker":"1485","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>The recommendations of an Expert Group to develop a new funding model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) were adopted by Government in December.

While this unit in my Department will lead on coordination matters, policy responsibility for Child Poverty resides with colleagues in the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection also leads on the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020 &ndash; 2025, aimed at reducing poverty and improving social inclusion. Relevant Officials are in contact in relation to agreeing a new child poverty target under the Roadmap, and identifying a programme of work to address child poverty under the successor framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures (BOBF). In this regard I have scheduled a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Brien this month to further this work.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Child Guarantee provides Ireland with an opportunity to re-focus and, where necessary, re-evaluate our approach in tackling child poverty and promoting children&rsquo;s well-being. The objective of the Guarantee is to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services and as such forms a subset to the wider issues revolving around child poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Child Guarantee calls on Member States to guarantee for children in need, free access to early childhood education and care; education (including school-based activities); and healthcare; and to ensure effective access to healthy nutrition, a healthy meal each school day and adequate housing. An online consultation in relation to the National Action Plan for the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee ran from 1st December 2021 until 14th January 2022.\u00a0 Twenty-one submissions were received from various organisations, a synopsis of which was compiled and issued for further consideration by relevant Departments.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the obligations for Ireland under the Child Guarantee, DCEDIY is currently developing a National Action Plan for the Child Guarantee, in collaboration with a range of Government Departments. Responses from all relevant Departments are expected in the coming days. Following the refinement of text following inputs received, an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) will be convened to assist in the drafting and finalisation of the plan.<\/p>  <p>  The effective implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Future (BOBF) and its cross government and cross sectoral engagement will inform the implementation of the Child Guarantee National Action Plan to ensure it is collaborative, integrated and, ultimately, impactful. Identifying the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people will be a particular focus of work to define the implementation structures and processes.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is anticipated that Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan for the Child Guarantee will be published by March 2022 following Government approval, and submitted to the EU Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[8737\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"what efforts are being taken to tackle any potential increase in child poverty rates due to the rising cost of living and energy prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that I am not in a position to comment on these matters which\u00a0are more appropriate for the attention of my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":404,"content":"<p>Question No. 177 answered with Question No. 175.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":405,"content":"<p>Question No. 178 answered with Question No. 175.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[8740\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the new actions that his Department will carry out in response to the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Annual Report 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>The sixth and final Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures\u00a0Annual Report, alongside the Indicator\u00a0Set, demonstrated that we have made strong progress\u00a0in our efforts to meet the needs and aspirations of children and young people living in Ireland.

A number of other issues are being considered for inclusion in the emergent Family Justice Strategy, including the availability of and access to support services; the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes, where possible and appropriate; information dissemination and awareness raising; and oversight of the implementation of any proposed reforms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600074#WRH05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600075#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[8666\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021600075#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will confirm an opening day for the extension to Longford Garda station.","asker":"1597","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the effective and efficient use of Garda resources, including all Garda stations.

Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7.
