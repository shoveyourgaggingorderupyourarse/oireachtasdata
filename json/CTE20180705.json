He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We are dealing with the Department of Health and the HSE under the Department of Health appropriation accounts, Vote 38 for 2016 and the HSE financial statements 2017.  However, the committee decided to provide up to one hour at the beginning of the meeting to deal specifically with the cervical cancer crisis issue.  We will proceed with our examination of the financial statements after that.  We will take the routine business of the committee in the afternoon.<\/p><p>There are a number of items relevant to this morning's meeting in correspondence which I am putting on the record so they can be discussed in detail in public.

Next is correspondence No. 1460<b><\/b>from Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, providing his opening statement.  It is noted and published.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 1427<b><\/b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 25 June 2018, provides information on the management of legal costs and open disclosure as requested by the committee on 14 June 2018.  Mr. Breen's correspondence deals with the State Claims Agency management approach to CervicalCheck cancer misdiagnosis litigation; and details including the status of screening and non-screening cancer misdiagnosis claims for cervical cancer, bowel cancer and breast cancer.  We note and publish this.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Correspondence No. 1432<b><\/b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE is in respect of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s access to CervicalCheck records.

We have a relevant note on the screen.  We are not having a discussion; it is just by way of information.  It states in respect of the point about CervicalCheck attendees that at this point it is important to advise the committee that Charles O'Hanlon is on sick leave and certified unwell and, therefore, will not be in a position to attend the committee.<\/p><p>In respect of Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, she is employed by Holles Street and indicated that she is no longer with the HSE.  Since our meeting last week we have written to Dr. Flannelly in her course of employment and she sent an email back to the committee, reference 1451, which we note and publish.  Dr. Flannelly was the clinical director of CervicalCheck.  In her email, she thanks the committee for the invitation to appear before it on a voluntary witness basis to address the issues regarding the CervicalCheck programme.  She states that she is at present preparing to meet with Dr. Scally as part of his investigation next week, and that she is currently in the UK where she has work commitments until the middle of next week.  That is now this week.  She goes on to state that she would value the opportunity to help our committee by attending as per our request on a voluntary basis but in view of the above she requests that this be rearranged to a different date.  She states that she will liaise with the clerk in respect of rescheduling it.<\/p><p>I want to put on record that while she is not here today, Dr. Flannelly has given a definite commitment that she is happy to meet with us at a more suitable time.  I think we will have to come back to that.  We will discuss the timing of our meetings as part of our work programme in the afternoon.  We will not set the time now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#C00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>We should ask if she will come in next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#C00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We made a request last week for specific individuals.

As of 9 o'clock this morning, how many women have been identified as having been affected?  That figure was at 209.<\/p> <p>  It has been reported that the independent review of the cases of 3,000 women will not be completed on schedule and is only commencing now.  What is the reason for that?  Why has it taken so long?  If there were 300,000 slides per year and it takes five minutes to review each, a team of ten people could carry out the analysis in a few weeks even if each slide is surveyed twice and the women's slide history examined.  Why was there a commitment to complete the review within a timeframe which has not been followed?  Why was information on the delay not made public?  Why is the review only starting now?  It will not be possible for it to form part of the Scally review, which must be completed by the end of August.  The Minister for Health, stated that the final Scally review must be completed by the end of August.  However, these 3,000 slides will not be part of it because of the delay.  Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, who gave evidence to the committee, are extremely disappointed and upset this morning that the review of the slides will not form part of the Scally review.  Why was the review committed to on the basis of an unrealistic timeframe?  When will it be completed?  How in the name of God can we have a situation where Dr. Scally must report by the end of August to ensure credibility but this review will not form part of his report because of the delay?  How will his review be complete without that information?  How in the name of God did we end up in this situation?  Who committed to those unrealistic timelines?<\/p> <p>  I have a third question which I had better ask before the Chair cuts me off.  It relates to the legal cases, of which I understand there is a significant number.  I remind the witnesses that the State Claims Agency, SCA, will appear before the committee next week.  As I understand it, the HSE hired a legal firm, the identity of which I know, to draft a protocol for how cytology slides are given to the women affected.  That protocol has been in use for several weeks.  Solicitors for several affected women have gone to court to seek the release of the slides and in such cases the HSE has handed them over without the protocol being followed.  These are urgent cases.  All present know what that means: the women are in difficult health situations.  Why is a protocol needed for the release of slides to which the women are entitled?  Why is it taking so long?  Why can the protocol be bypassed when a woman goes to court and takes on CervicalCheck and it or the SCA is so embarrassed that it hands over the slides?  Some 80 to 90 women have sought their files from CervicalCheck and some have received access thereto.<\/p><p>When it comes to getting their slides they are being blocked by a protocol, which I doubt anyone has heard of up to now.  Given what the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, said in the D&aacute;il and the evidence given to this committee and the Joint Committee on Health, of which I am also a member, why is this protocol necessary?  What is its purpose?  If it can be bypassed in urgent cases why can it not be bypassed in this instance and these slides given to the women and their solicitors immediately?

If a monetary value is attached to non-disclosure in at least one case, it may also be attached in others.

They separated two elements, telling us that the medical files were one matter, while the slides were another.  I have examined the contracts with Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology.  They are similar, if not identical.  Under the heading of \"Storage and Disaster Recovery\" on page 12, the contractor shall at the request of the national screening service forward eligible samples stored by the contractor or on the contractor's behalf to the national screening service or any third party specified by the service in a manner prescribed by it within three working days.  It seems clear from this that the national screening service is in control and ownership of the slides.  Why is there any question of a delay when the contract is clear about the contractors' obligations and the service's rights?<\/p> <p>  On radio in the past half hour, the solicitor for Vicky Phelan stated the HSE was holding up the protocol to agree to the release of slides and that, until this occurred, they could not be reviewed by clinical cytologists.  Is the HSE holding it up and, if so, why?  <\/p> <p>  Someone made reference to an apology, but an apology is hollow if it is not followed through with actions that will give it meaning.  We are being given the runaround on some of our questions.  The contract is clear, but we are not being given clear answers about the protocol.  If it is being held up, any claim about dealing sincerely with people who may have been harmed by the State is hollow.

As shown in Figure 1, on members&rsquo; screens, HSE direct expenditure on pay and pensions accounted for over one third of the expenditure, totalling &euro;5.36 billion.  This included around &euro;300 million paid for agency staff services.  Grants to section 38 and section 39 agencies accounted for just over a quarter of the expenditure and totalled &euro;4 billion.  Expenditure on primary care and medical card schemes, including drugs refund schemes, accounted for a fifth of the expenditure, or just under &euro;3 billion.<br\/><br\/>The HSE recorded income for the year totalling &euro;15.1 billion.  The bulk of this - 94% - came in the form of a revenue grant paid to the HSE out of the Vote for the Department of Health.  The balance of the income comprises charges to patients using HSE services, and a range of miscellaneous sources, including employee pension contributions paid by HSE staff and the proceeds of pension-related deductions in the health sector, which the HSE retains.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the increase in income in 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s outturn for the year was a net operating deficit of &euro;140 million - a significant deterioration year on year.  The 2016 deficit was &euro;10 million.  The operating deficit in a year represents an effective first call on the following year&rsquo;s recurrent grant funding provided from the Vote.<br\/><br\/>The HSE financial statements also include a capital income and expenditure account.  For 2017, this recorded income of &euro;462 million, mainly comprising capital grants from the Vote.  Expenditure in the year totalled &euro;454 million, resulting in a net capital surplus of &euro;8 million, which the HSE carried forward to 2018.  A capital surplus of &euro;15 million was brought forward from 2016 into 2017 but the HSE had not obtained formal ministerial sanction to do so<b>, <\/b>as is required under the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014.<br\/><br\/>The audit report on the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 financial statement drew attention to a continued significant level of non-competitive procurement by the HSE.  We found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in regard to 36% of a sample of &euro;51 million worth of goods and services procured in 2017, spread across five HSE locations.  This is consistent with our findings in similar testing for many years past.  The HSE&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control outlines the steps it is taking to deal with this problem but states that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.  <br\/><br\/>The audit report also drew attention to inadequate monitoring and oversight of HSE grants to outside agencies, which is a continuing concern.<br\/><br\/>Members will recall last October examining chapter 19 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2016, which reviewed the HSE&rsquo;s framework for monitoring grants to service providers in the context of the audit of the 2016 financial statements of the HSE.  Our work for the 2017 audit, and that of the HSE&rsquo;s own internal audit, found that similar weaknesses recurred in 2017.  The HSE acknowledges the audit findings in the 2017 statement on internal control.<br\/><br\/>The appropriation account for Vote 38 - Health - before the committee relates to 2016.

The other item on today&rsquo;s agenda, the HSE financial statements 2017, will be addressed in the first instance by Mr. Connaghan, as the accountable person for those accounts.<\/p> <p>  Since 2015, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, funding of the HSE is provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health - Vote 38.  Accordingly, in 2016 the Department was responsible for a budget of &euro;13.649 billion for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to the HSE and to research, consultative and advisory bodies.  The budget includes the additional &euro;500 million provided by Government in 2016 to the health Vote, by way of mid-year adjustment, to improve the base funding of the Department of Health.  This succeeded in 2016 with the health Vote coming in under budget by &euro;2.221 million without recourse to a Supplementary Estimate.  <\/p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2016 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department such as the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the HIQA and a range of other bodies.  In 2016, the Department had 400 staff.  The Department&rsquo;s role is to provide strategic leadership for the health service and to ensure Government policies are translated into actions and implemented effectively.  We support the Minister and Ministers of State in their implementation of Government policy and in discharging their governmental, parliamentary and departmental duties.  <\/p> <p>  Much of the public debate tends to be on weaknesses in our health services.  Identifying measures to address these in association with our colleagues in the HSE undoubtedly demands continuing work on the part of the staff of the Department.  However, we also have other roles.  Importantly, we seek to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, we work cross-sectorally to achieve this objective.  Our life expectancy, at 81.8 years, is now one year above the OECD average but there is much more that can be done to better promote health and prevent ill-health.  We also work internationally with EU colleagues and the World Health Organization on health issues.  Considerable work is under way with the EU and the United Kingdom to address the health challenges caused by Brexit and to ensure that North-South and east-west co-operation on health matters is maintained.  We also support the Minister and Ministers of State in their work including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2017 the Department processed over 11,000 parliamentary questions, representing 22% of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across Government. <\/p> <p>  The 2016 gross provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;14.109 billion.  The 2016 outturn was almost &euro;14.107 billion, leaving an overall saving of &euro;2 million.  Of the 2016 gross provision for current expenditure, &euro;205 million was provided to the Department-related subheads in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to agencies under the aegis of the Department, other than the HSE.  The 2016 outturn for these subheads was &euro;176 million, giving an underspend of &euro;29 million, and &euro;13.387 billion of the 2016 gross provision for current expenditure was provided to HSE related subheads.  The 2016 outturn for these subheads was &euro;13.405 billion giving an overspend of &euro;18 million.  The overspend primarily related to funding the existing level of service in both acute and community services and pension costs.  This overspend was met from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  The 2016 provision for capital expenditure was &euro;516 million and the 2016 outturn was &euro;525 million.  However, funding was transferred by means of virement to the capital subheads from savings elsewhere in the Vote to provide for capital developments at mental health facilities.  The 2016 appropriations-in-aid to the health Vote was on profile at &euro;460 million.  The end year net outturn for current and capital was &euro;13.647 billion against a net provision of &euro;13.649 billion, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of &euro;2 million. <\/p> <p>  The Department continues to develop its policy and performance oversight in respect of a range of complex services falling within total public health expenditure.  We are working on a significant reform agenda in line with the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  This includes, as an initial important step, legislative proposals approved by Government to improve governance within the HSE through the introduction of a competency-based governing board this year.  Subsequent policy development is likely to see a strong national centre but with greater devolution of decision-making and accountability, including financial accountability, to regional integrated care organisations.  The further development and linkage of corporate and clinical governance at all levels within the health service, again in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report, will be a priority in ensuring the delivery of effective, safe and accountable health services. <\/p> <p>  I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas generally on this objective and am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I will introduce the senior management members with me today.  They are Mr. Stephen Mulvany, Mr. Liam Woods and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and I will therefore confine my opening remarks to a number of issues, the first of which is the financial outturn for 2017.  A Revised Estimate for health was approved and notified by letter of determination of 29 December 2017.  The HSE received once-off revenue funding of &euro;208.3 million to cover winter initiatives, State Claims Agency increased costs, the shortfall of acute hospital private patient income and central pay awards.  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2017 record a combined revenue and capital deficit of &euro;131.5 million.  Within this there is a capital surplus of &euro;8.3 million and a revenue deficit of &euro;139.9 million.  The total 2017 revenue deficit when deficits in section 38-funded providers are taken account of is &euro;165.9 million.<\/p> <p>  The most significant area of deficit in 2017 relates to the acute hospital division which was &euro;139.7 million.  The majority of this deficit - &euro;73 million - is attributable to income shortfalls and associated bad debt costs primarily related to hospital private maintenance charges.  In addition, there are cost overruns of 0.4% equivalent to &euro;13.4 million on pay and &euro;54 million or 3% related to non-pay of which the majority - &euro;44 million - relate to clinical non-pay.  A significant driver of these cost overruns is the provision of additional activity in response to service demand, the complexity of that activity and the growing age and related needs of hospital inpatients.  As evidenced within the health service capacity review 2018, Ireland reported the second highest occupancy rate of those countries reporting to the OECD.  This indicates a hospital system that is operating under considerable stress and which is short of the necessary capacity. <\/p> <p>  Social care services reported a deficit of &euro;24.5 million.  A significant element of the deficit in this area relates to the costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability, including the provision of emergency placements which continue to be a significant pressure in 2018.  Individual placements can cost up to &euro;0.5 million.  The costs of compliance with HIQA residential standards in the intellectual disability sector has also been a contributory factor in the deficit.  <\/p> <p>  To put the HSE&rsquo;s financial performance in context, if we look back over the ten years from 2008 to 2017, there has been 0.68% or &euro;838 million in net Supplementary Estimates provided to the HSE in respect of areas directly related to service pressures and financial performance challenges.  The balance of supplementary funding over this period has been in respect of Exchequer-related or technical items outside of the HSE&rsquo;s control.  That is equivalent to 1.56% or &euro;1.9 billion.  It includes the PCRS at &euro;0.791 million or 0.64%, whose costs are largely driven by policy, legislation and related demographic and societal factors not amenable to normal financial management. <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to matters of exception reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of 2017.<\/p><p>In the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate which accompanies the annual financial statement the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to concerns about the monitoring and oversight arrangements for grants to outside agencies, non-competitive procurement issues and also noted that the HSE had not received sanction from the Minister for Health for the capital surplus brought forward from 2016.  The HSE acknowledges these matters of concern and is progressing medium to long-term plans required to bring about improvements as follows.<\/p><p> I shall turn first to the issue of non-compliant procurement.  The HSE incurs procurable expenditure in excess of &euro;2.2 billion annually.  Given the scale and complexity of the HSE&rsquo;s overall procurement activity, it has been highlighted and acknowledged at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and by my predecessor that it will take a sustained effort over a number of years to ensure high levels of compliance.  This is a key focus for the HSE.  The HSE, through its health business services, HBS, procurement function, continues to progress a transformational programme of reform of its procurement arrangements to improve compliance with public procurement regulations, increase the usage of contracts, put frameworks in place by it and liaise with the Office of Government Procurement.  The HBS procurement function works closely with the Office of Government Procurement.  There have been a number of successful tender outcomes, particularly in the utilities category such as electricity, fuel oil, gas, telecommunications and vehicles.  We also know that there is a considerable amount of work ahead in cleaning, security and professional services.  This collaborative effort is achieving value for money and contributing to an increase in overall procurement compliance and the development of the overall procurement reform programme.<\/p><p> The HSE is implementing a number of initiatives which are organised around three key themes: supporting infrastructure; sourcing and compliance.  Further detail of the steps being taken to address the issue of non-compliant procurement are published in the statement of internal control within the 2017 annual financial statements.<\/p><p> On the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies, the HSE has consistently acknowledged the positive role the voluntary sector plays in the development and delivery of health and personal social services.  The HSE is also acutely aware of the need for the appropriate level of oversight of the grants provided for outside agencies.  In 2017 just under &euro;4.1 billion of the HSE&rsquo;s total expenditure was related to grants to more than 2,000 outside agencies.  The agencies range from the large voluntary hospitals and disability organisations to small local community-based agencies.<\/p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s governance framework is consistent with the management and accountability requirements for grants provided from Exchequer funding as set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Circular 13\/2014.  Weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies have previously been identified.  The HSE continues to take the necessary actions to address these weaknesses.  The national compliance unit which was established in 2014 supports the development of improved grant oversight by community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and hospital groups which have delegated responsibility for the management of the relationship with outside agencies at operational level.<\/p><p> Improved oversight has raised the level of compliance by grant funded agencies.  An example of the actions already taken is the external review of governance arrangements for section 38 providers  which is under way.  The purpose of these reviews is to confirm that appropriate governance arrangements are in place and aligned with those set out in the annual compliance statements provided by section 38 agencies for the HSE.  The main compliance issues identified in the review process relate to procurement, HR legacy issues and a need, in some instances, to establish an appropriate internal audit function.  It is expected that the external reviews commissioned will be completed by October.  Agencies will provide status reports on the progress made in addressing issues and such issues will be included in local operational oversight.  The HSE is committed to implementing a five year rolling programme that will prioritise section 38 agencies not reviewed in the current programme.  It will be extended to include the larger section 39 agencies.  Further details of the steps being taken to address the issue of weaknesses are published in the statement of internal control within the 2017 annual financial statements.<\/p><p> It would be remiss of me not to look ahead and consider the role of healthcare transformation and how we employ the HSE's assets and resources.  As is the case in many developed health systems, we face the challenge of growing user expectations, unmet need and core infrastructural deficits.  For many years we have been aware of the need for a shift in health service delivery in order to move from the more traditional focus of treatment and cure to that of prevention and treatment, when required.  The current arrangements for service delivery in Ireland are characterised by an over-reliance on more costly, hospital-based care, with continuing opportunities to deliver care more appropriately in primary and community settings.  There are challenges in responding effectively to the planned, unplanned and emergency needs of patients in hospitals.<\/p><p> Similar pressures are faced by services in primary and community services, including services for people with disabilities and people who need mental health support, with demand outstripping supply in many areas.  In addition, there is a growing need to maintain or replace our current infrastructure and equipment.  I am pleased to note that I am a personal supporter of the Sl&aacute;intecare report which signals a new direction of travel in relation to eligibility, delivery and the funding of health and social care in Ireland into the future.  We are implementing a range of programmes to prepare the ground for longer term transformation in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are tens of thousands of dedicated staff working in health services, changing practices, improving care for patients, advocating for and driving service improvements day in and day out.  Staff and management working locally are providing leadership and support for nationally supported initiatives, with the aim of reforming services and seeking to deliver higher value care.  A number of transformational programmes are continuing in 2018, with a particular focus on four key themes, the first of which is improving population health and well-being by keeping people well and reducing the incidence of ill health and supporting people to live as independently as possible.  The second theme is delivering care closer to home, with the intent of meeting the vast majority of the population&rsquo;s healthcare needs in more local settings, with institutional and hospital-based care being reserved for only those individuals who require complex, specialised, emergency care and even then only for the shortest time possible.  The third theme is the development of specialist hospital care networks by progressing numerous workstreams in our national clinical and integrated care programmes.  The fourth theme is the improvement of quality, safety and value by building support for effective care that is delivered according to best evidence of what is clinically effective in improving health outcomes by reducing variations in how care is delivered and developing skills and capacity for quality improvement in healthcare delivery settings.  In addition, we are developing structures and reconfiguring teams within the HSE to strengthen our approach to population need assessment, demographic analysis and the utilisation of service design in order to develop more equitable and effective resource allocation models, particularly for primary and community services.  This goes hand in hand with Mr. Breslin's statement on geo-alignments and local devolved responsibility.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s public health service was designed for a time when we had a different demographic profile.  Today the expectations surrounding clinical governance and standards have never been higher.  The population, however, is older.  Modelling forecasts tell us that the number of people aged over 65 years will increase by nearly 110,000 in the next five years.  The fact that people are living longer is great news, but a large proportion of this older age group now live with two or more chronic conditions which make many of them more vulnerable and frail.  This has a consequential impact on resources.  In that context, the imminent publication of the Department of Health&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan provides a powerful opportunity to create much needed strategic certainty for the health and social care delivery system in Ireland.  We are committed to working with the Government and the Department to do this and implement the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>We shall start the question and answer session with Deputy David Cullinane who has 20 minutes.

It might be better if I start with the position over the last six months to a year.  Let us understand the impacts of what we have seen over the last winter, going back to the last part of 2017.  We know we had the worst flu season for ten years.  The health service coped adequately with that but it did drive additional costs in terms of isolation, intensive care unit, ICU, costs and extended lengths of stay and intensity.  That is one factor.  We also had some of the worst trolley figures ever over the course of the last six months, although taken year on year, as Mr. Woods stated to the health committee yesterday, we are roughly the same.  That period drove some really quite exceptional costs.  I had to make some decisions during that time in the interests of patient safety in terms of sourcing additional capacity, authorising things like weekend and overtime work just to ensure we could get people out of hospitals appropriately.

The behaviour of insurers around that gave rise to a probable &euro;73 million of the total, which was &euro;139.7 million.  On the service delivery side, the biggest driver last year both in terms of growth year on year and against budget was the non-pay clinical costs of treating patients.  That was a &euro;44 million figure within a total service deficit of &euro;67 million.  Driving those costs are two factors, namely, the volume of care provided, which is increasing, and the complexity of care.  They underlie what is going on in the hospital system operationally.<\/p> <p>  The other factor the director general mentioned is that there was a &euro;13 million challenge against the pay budget.  That is against a pay base of over &euro;3 billion.  There are a couple of factors driving pay.  One is that it would include agency and locum costs, so the specialing within the hospital system of cases that have high-intensity need around the clock is a factor.  That is growing as an element of cost.  Clearly, effective movement to community of people who are fit for discharge is an important piece in managing that.  That is a driver.  The other is to control the total numbers of those employed within the health environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Woods and Mr. Connaghan.  That gives me answers as to why there was a deficit.  Essentially, Mr. Woods is saying the two main drivers in terms of acute hospital spend were that the volume of care has increased as has the complexity, which I imagine is things like unexpected flu outbreaks and so on, resulting in greater isolation and containment needs.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Connaghan also mentioned the trolley figures.  I imagine they reflect increased demand with more people looking for beds when there are not enough beds.  We know that.  The more demand and pressure on hospitals, the more spend there will be.  However, why is that not forecast?  Why was it not built in to the estimation of the spend?  Were the circumstances really exceptional?  Were they outliers or were they potentially foreseen?  Did we just not allocate enough money in last year's voted expenditure to health to cover what should have been the amount given to make sure we were in a position to properly treat patients?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#Q00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>To give a direct answer to a very direct question as to whether the activity was expected, in terms of emergency department, ED, attendances over the period, I am talking about those who were over 75 years old because when we look at the cost we tend to think there is more cost associated with the elderly than with those who are perhaps in their 30s.  Over the time period, ED attendances of people aged 75 years and older were up 6.7% and ED admissions over that period were up by 6.4% for the over 75s.  ED attendances across the whole population were up 4.8% so there is considerable pressure that I do not think was anticipated at the start of the year.  The other factor, which is important in relation to those who are over 75, is that it is quite clear - and this is very welcome - that with the population living longer, there are more patients presenting with more complex needs inside our hospital system.  There are some marvellous studies available about the level of comorbidity or multiple chronic conditions currently in the population.  I think I said in my opening statement that this is a factor, so the complexity of care is also increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I want to come now to agency staff, which Mr. Woods mentioned as being one of the issues.

Agency is essential at times, but there are parts of the country where the cost premium - Mr. Woods talked about the average - can be higher, particularly in respect of medical agency.  The issue is the market and the availability.  To be very clear for Deputies, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the cost of agency.  Not only are there cost issues associated with it, there is also not as much continuity of care.

I ask that this be addressed in the context of whatever briefing paper is given to us as well.<\/p> <p>  On a related matter, I wish to come to one of the regional issues.  I gave prior notice to Mr. Connaghan that I would raise this issue.  A briefing note on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, was given to Oireachtas Members in the south east.  Waterford and Wexford form one catchment area for CAMHS.  We had five child psychiatrist positions at University Hospital Waterford last year.  One of the psychiatrists retired and three resigned citing workload, poor infrastructure and not being listened to.  They resigned out of frustration and annoyance at not getting answers to questions they were putting.  The briefing note I have been given by the Department states that with effect from Friday, 6 July, there will only be one consultant paediatric psychiatrist employed in the Waterford area and that person will be on annual leave from 9 July 2018, which was pre-booked in April.  In other words, we will have no child psychiatrist at all in Waterford - none.  The only service being supplied at the moment is an agency consultant coming from Galway to do a clinic at weekends.  The actual child psychiatrist provision and the resultant care they would give to people is almost non-existent.<\/p> <p>  How did it get to the sorry state that we are left with one child psychiatrist in one hospital?  This is an issue throughout the State.  The briefing note also states there is difficulty in recruiting child psychiatrists.  How did we end up in a situation whereby three psychiatrists resigned, with the reasons they have given, not on Mr. Connaghan's watch but certainly on the HSE's watch, and whereby for a period there will be no cover whatsoever in one of our major acute hospitals?

Why was corrective action not taken?  Now the HSE is left scrambling to look internationally, doing conference calls and all the other work to fill the posts whereas the HSE had people in posts and they felt it was so bad that they walked away.  In fact, I heard one of them on national radio in a very distressed state, almost feeling guilty that he walked away from his post, but felt he had no choice because people in power, people with responsibility for delivering services, were not listening to him.  How does Mr. Connaghan respond to him and to the patients who are now being left without a service?  Whatever is being done now is great, and the HSE has to do its job to fill those posts, but Mr. Connaghan has to account for why those people left in the first place and why, as we sit here, patients in Waterford and elsewhere, young people, are not getting the services they should get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#R01700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to be aware of the reasons for that.

We seem to have an increased dependency on section 38 organisations, which is possibly part of the problem.

The HSE itself cannot pick up the slack if corrective action is taken.<\/p><p> Mr. Connaghan said in his opening statement that the purpose of these reviews is to confirm that appropriate governance arrangements are in place.  I would argue that the weaknesses in governance are not the problem.  They are part of the problem.  Enforcement is a problem.

One is the hospice in Harold's Cross.  There is a report on that which we have not got to yet, though we will.  Is Mr. Connaghan satisfied that the sanctions are robust enough to make sure that we do not have recurring issues with governance failures and misspending of money by these section 38 organisations?

It looks very different from what I understand was in place a couple of years ago.  We have a service arrangement in detail and an annual agreement with penalties for late completion in place for section 38 and larger section 39 bodies.  We have grant aid agreements for section 39 organisations.  Against that background, we have an annual compliance statement which covers things like governance, risk, pay policy, tax and procurement which comes from each of these organisations.

Mr. Breslin said that in 2017, the Department processed more than 11,000 parliamentary questions, 22% of all parliamentary questions for Ministers across Government.  I know from my experience that practically everything I table in parliamentary questions to the Department of Health receives a one line reply, referring it to the HSE.  I am not asking Mr. Breslin to do it now, but will he give us a breakdown of that 22%, indicating how many go to the HSE?  It probably overstates the amount of work that falls on the Department and understates the work that falls on the HSE in responding to questions.  Many of the questions that I pose which go to the HSE can take some time to come back.  It would be useful to hear from the HSE the quantum of work relating to parliamentary questions.  If that is not available now, it would be quite useful for us to get information.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions relating to how money is spent when people are in an acute hospital because there is inadequate provision of home care packages, although I know it is always finite.

Like most other Deputies, we look at people coming through the door in our constituency offices.  We see the kinds of challenges that people face.

The good news is that 70% of them are being carried out within four months, which is positive.  It is slightly down on last year when it was slightly higher.  The bad news, however, is that 28% of children are waiting more than a year for speech and language therapy.  Some 50% of all the assessments that are currently outstanding are in the CHO 4 area.<\/p> <p>  In terms of CAMHS, in March this year there were 2,691 people waiting for assessment, which was a 15% increase since September 2017.  Some 14% of them, 386 people, are waiting more than a year.  Of those, 55% are in the CHO 4 area.  Regarding assessments of needs, in March this year there were 4,242 people waiting for assessments.  Of those, 80% are waiting beyond the statutory timeframe of three months.  Again, 50% of them are in the CHO 4 area.  Clearly this area has issues which need to be addressed.  Do the witnesses have any comments on this area within the organisation?  It is falling far behind everywhere else across the board in terms of speech and language, CAMHS and assessments of needs.  Can the director general tell me the reason?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#U01600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>For any child to wait longer than is necessary is a tragedy.  Looking at some of the other services aside from the ones outlined by the Deputy today, clearly our position is not one we would want to readily accept.

We understand the gravity of the question the Deputy is asking.<\/p> <p>  There was some investment in this area in 2016 and 2017.  I realise it is difficult to attract staff to certain locations.  We need to do more in terms of providing cross-regional support, so if there is one CHO that is in trouble because it cannot attract and retain staff or where we do not have the right mix we must do more.  Looking at the statistics here, it is 50% in CHO 4 but it is nothing in CHO 1 or CHO 2, for example.  The question is what we can do to provide cross cover.  That is the first issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is due to meet officials soon and we will wait to see what action plan comes out of that.

Nobody could say that every euro is used as effectively as it could be by the HSE.  That is the experience of health services the world over.  We have some distance to go to ensure that we are best in class in the delivery of services.  The expanding and aging population is placing us under pressure to grow services and that pressure will continue.  Waiting for additional money to fall through the letter box every year for investment in new services will not be sufficient to address the demand for those services.  We must also consider how our services are organised and how productive they are.  That is at the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare report to which Mr. Connaghan made reference.  One often finds that individual parts of the service are working productively but that services are not properly joined up and the right services are not being offered in the right places.  Taking the example made earlier, a person waiting for a year for speech and language therapy will experience developmental delay as a result and his or her requirements, when eventually seen, will be significantly more complex than would have been the case had earlier treatment been provided.  Putting resources into a primary care community setting for far more accessible care can often help us avoid some of the more expensive approaches of highly specialist care such as acute hospital care and so on.  That is key to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  Also of significant importance is working very smartly, using information and technology and doing things really well.

I thank the Deputy for his kind opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  What examples do we have of the ability of the health service right now in Ireland to pursue good value for money?  That was the first question.  The second question is: how can we spread that best practice throughout Ireland?  I will consider the three different types of value-for-money activity in terms of our pursuit of better value for the public purse.  One is what I would call the usual suspects.  They are the basic things that are non-clinical in essence.  They are good procurement, conversion of agency posts into full-time and substantive posts, efficiencies in back office services such as print, energy and postage, and shared non-clinical front-line services.  We do not need to have 29 or 56 of everything for Ireland.  They are things that are being pursued right now by each CHO and each hospital group.  That is the first category.  One must understand that the first category only touches a certain element of the cost base.  One needs to look beyond it in terms of being able to look at the entire &euro;15.2 billion.<\/p> <p>  The second category I will draw the committee's attention to is clinical efficiency.  We need to do a lot more in that regard.  Clinical efficiency does not mean we need to get our clinicians to work harder - although maybe in some cases we do - but to work smarter with better technology and more modern methods of delivery of services where we help clinicians to do that.  An example is the pursuit of theatre efficiency.  We know if we were to arrange things better and look at the best performing theatre system in Ireland we would probably get more throughput but to do that we would probably need some investment in things like theatre systems and new and innovative ways of working.  That is an example of clinical efficiency.<\/p> <p>  The third and biggest area, which is where most of the &euro;15 billion would lie, is in what I would call efficiencies associated with the model of care.  I will boil that down into a couple of big things.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a hook here.  One of the big hooks is the separation of elective and unscheduled care.  I came from a system where we had developed that over a five-year period.  What we found by separating elective and unscheduled care was much greater efficiency in terms of throughput because it was unrestricted and not stopped by the vagaries of winter.  Where there was protected elective time we could plan efficiency and throughput through a system, which in that case was protected.  The idea in Sl&aacute;intecare to do something with investment in that would drive better clinical efficiency.  Another example is we can do things differently.  Mr. Breslin made reference to the fact we are doing too much in acute systems.  If I take some of the examples such as the Sligo air care model or the Letterkenny urology model, which move activity out of the hospital system into the community, they mean faster delivery which is closer to home and also more efficient.  It allows clinicians in the acute system to concentrate on the things they need to concentrate on.  They are three buckets of things on which we can pursue value for money.  We are only part of the way down that road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Can I ask a more personal question?

If people in other Departments, particularly in other countries, are not up to scratch they are taken out or moved aside.

Many of them are doing a fantastic job every day of the week, particularly when it comes to times when the provision of healthcare to the nation is threatened such as during storms and snowfall.  Many of them are doing a fantastic job.  That is reflected in patient satisfaction surveys.  The Deputy raises a more fundamental point about the process in place to assess, in particular, senior managers and staff in responsible positions.  How do we assess whether The objectives they are meant to pursue in a year on a personal basis have been delivered?  We do not have such a system operating in the Irish healthcare system.

They had to say they would not work in the system that was in place.  I am told a bed management officer is needed for the south east, including Wexford, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  That would be an officer to manage the beds.  There is also a unit promised for Clonmel to relieve the pressure on Kilkenny.  The same is required in Wexford and Waterford.

Ms Phelan stated on radio, and to me privately as well, that the information was not being provided.  According to her conversation with Dr. Scally this morning, there was still information he was not getting, much information was being redacted, and there was much legal process before information was being provided and questions were not being answered.

I will just check again that that has been done.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Scally is comfortable in so far as he tells me that if there is something, particularly in relation to patient confidentiality - this will be very, very rare - we will take that out because we need to preserve some of the interests of the patients in this as well.  All of that should be provided.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the provision and searchability of documents, one of the things that hampered the position between Dr. Scally and the HSE right at the very outset was the different platforms that we had in terms of their use and searchability.  We have made recommendations - I think Dr. Scally has taken these board - that we invest in an appropriate eDiscovery platform which can search anything.  For the very few instances where we do not have original documentation that can be searched through the normal Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Pro, we can use eDiscovery platforms with OCR to be able to identify everything.

There is a fundamental issue here.  The lady who brought us to this stage is on national radio, on the most listened-to programme on radio in Ireland, stating that she heard in conversation with Dr. Scally this morning that the HSE is not co-operating fully.  That is merely a fact.  Everybody in Ireland who was listening heard it.  I listened to it after speaking to Ms Phelan.<\/p> <p>  I accept what Mr. Connaghan is saying.  Whatever is going on, it is not working.  There is not a hope in hell of Dr. Scally having a comprehensive report by the end of August.  I am saying it now - not a hope in hell.  We already know it will not be comprehensive because the 3,000 cases will not have been reviewed and that will not tally.  That means the report itself will not be comprehensive.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry but this is deeply unacceptable to the public watching the committee today.

If this protocol exists tomorrow, my confidence in the HSE as an organisation will have collapsed.  No legal protocol can be put in place that will take this length of time.  These women are entitled to their information.  Just, bloody well, give it to them.  If they go to the High Court, they will get it anyway because the HSE will be too embarrassed in front of a judge.  Will the HSE just give these 80 to 90 women the information they are all looking for?  Never mind about protocols, for dignity purposes give it to them.  Many of these women do not have the time.  Mr. Connaghan should just do that.<\/p> <p>  My third issue relating to the information provided is that the process for moving the HPV would be in place by October.

An assessment of the risk associated with each case is required to decide how we deploy that budget locally and individually, from what we have nationally.  Whether that is right or wrong and whether we have the risk assessment right all the time remains to be seen and that is open to challenge and it should be challenged because if it is not right we need to fix it.<\/p> <p>  The second point to consider is what will demand be like in the future.

There are two issues.  First, the insurers have taken a stance in the last two years around the timing of when we are entitled to charge in their view.  Our understanding of the legislation is very clear in that once the individual elects to be treated privately it is from the date of admission and the insurers are pursuing a line which says they will only pay from the date of a particular form being signed.  We have an entirely different view from that.  There is also what we would refer to as a campaign that the insurers are running, encouraging members not to use their insurance when admitted through the unscheduled care route into hospitals.

Over an extended period, both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department looked at that and said that was a major hidden subsidy to private healthcare within public hospitals because insurance companies were having their members treated in the public hospitals but because they did not get a single room, which is one of the cheaper parts of the total cost of a person's stay in a hospital, the insurance company was not paying for it.

The Minister for Health announced last week that he would deploy a modular catheterisation laboratory for University Hospital Waterford.  Mr. Connaghan knows that this has been a long-running issue.  An independent report carried out following the formation of the Government headed up by Dr. Niall Herity did not recommend a permanent second catheterisation laboratory at the hospital.  In any event, a modular laboratory will be deployed for a time period.  The Minister has stated the money will be made available in this year's budget but that there would be significant tendering, project design work, planning, construction and commissioning work.  Does Mr. Connaghan have the updated information because in his letter to Members of the Oireachtas, the Minister stated he had asked the HSE to commence the work of making this happen now?

To take the example of 2017, the Supplementary Estimate was &euro;195 million and some &euro;75 million of that figure was to do with the national pay deal, where the pay increases were brought forward.  In fairness, I have robust debate with the HSE on their finances, that is something that was imposed on them.  The Government met that cost.  There was a &euro;40 million Government initiative to try to improve winter responsiveness and try to open extra beds in acute hospitals and try to get home care levels increased.  Again that was a Government initiative.  Consequently, &euro;115 million from a total of &euro;195 million arose as a result of two Government decisions.<br\/><br\/>There was &euro;50 million for the State Claims Agency, with which members of this committee will be familiar and this reflects settlements and court settlements, which can be very significant.  One can have a &euro;10 million settlement and these figures can be both significant and unpredictable.  That is not say that we do not try to estimate them and try to provide funding for them but it is hard to get it exactly right.  The other area foe which the Supplementary Estimate was made available in 2017 was the area to which we have given some time, namely, the income area.  We provided &euro;30 million for that.  Above and beyond that Supplementary Estimate, last year there was a figure of &euro;140 million for the deficit that the HSE had generated at the end of the year.  I would see issues within that where again, although we made &euro;50 million available to the State Claims Agency, we got it wrong by &euro;10 million.  By the end of the year, during November and December, it was &euro;10 million above the figure we expected.  There are certainly other areas, where the Department would consider that it gets a budget that is set by the Government and which is based on the fiscal rules.  We are told that is the total amount of funding that is available for the health service and then we work with the HSE, outlining that it must come up with a service plan that can deliver the greatest value within a budget of &euro;15 billion.  There must be some areas of the health service, even though they are complex and difficult to manage, where people seek to manage their budget in such a way that by the end of the year, they do not have a deficit.  If there is not, the difficulty becomes that the people who have the deficit get that dealt with and the people who seek to manage without having a deficit have to bear it.  Although it is hard in the health service and there is demand that is hard to manage, we are seeking with the HSE to improve upon the budgetary discipline in the health service.<\/p><p> To bring it back to the Estimates process, we would look at each element of the HSE's budget with them.  As part of that we would engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then we would conclude a service plan.  I do know, in terms of Supplementary Estimates for example, that in previous years there were areas, perhaps pensions and retirements costs, demand-led schemes and fair deal schemes.  Where people seek to retire they must be paid their lump sum and these cases have been difficult to predict in advance.  Last year, no costs arose excess to what our predictions were in respect of areas like the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, pensions, demand-led schemes and fair deal schemes.  Last year, we did a better job in those areas and we continue to refine our methodologies.  Ultimately, it is the Oireachtas, on the recommendation of the Government, that decides the health budget but we and the HSE must come up with a service plan to deliver upon that.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#QQ01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I would say that it is the Government that decides, based on what the Government says the health budget is, rather than the Oireachtas but that is a moot point.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about next year's budget, which we do not know.

I think I have previously described the three tentative value elements to what the HSE is currently about.  One is what I would call the usual suspects, and I have gone over those, like print, postage, back office services, etc.  Right now the HSE is well engaged on that, with every CHO and every hospital group at national level, through what we are doing in terms of our procurement strategy.  The next bit is one where we are only partially engaged and we can do an awful lot more.  I would recall it is the clinical efficiency bit that I have previously explained.  That is doing things like increasing the level of day care surgery that we have.  That in itself leads me back to one of the drivers that we have in the national service plan.  We have always had, in the national service plan, a desire to do more for the amount of money that we have.  That is a good thing but the question is whether we are doing the right things.  Maybe it is not always right that we drive more activity through our hospitals.

The Deputy is right - a range of women were informed some significant time after they had been treated for cervical cancer that this was what was known about their previous smear test history.  Having got it up to date, there would still have been a time lag in the audit.  It is not that someone would be diagnosed today and told within a couple of weeks that we had looked at her smear test and that here was the result.  Dr. McKenna reflected that, rather than carrying out an audit that could be criticised and seen as inadequate, including by Dr. Scally who might say there was a problem with it, there would be a pause period of a couple of months.  The relevant individuals would be new diagnoses during that period.

I will bring it back to the beginning.  The trigger for an audit of a case is a diagnosis of cervical cancer and the CervicalCheck programme being informed that somebody has been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That is an individual notification.  CervicalCheck asks then if the person has a screening history.  On occasion the person will not have a screening history.  Where the person has a screening history the audit looks at the engagement with that person to see when CervicalCheck last engaged with the woman.  It is a case of whether they called her and whether she did not come, which is a possibility, or whether they called her and she came and she had a difficulty with the quality of the smear test, and it goes all the way through the chain.  The most important issue, however, is around the reading of the smear test and, after that has been looked at through a process to try to determine if there is a discordance, to communicate - this is where it fell down - that discordance to the woman's consultant who is treating her for cervical cancer, and for him or her to inform the woman that a previous smear had missed a screening potential to send her in for further review.<\/p> <p>  To bring that forward, as I understand it as a non-clinician, and it would be helpful if Dr. McKenna were here, the pause is for a period.  If somebody is diagnosed with cervical cancer, and there will be a lag in that information getting to CervicalCheck so there is always a lag in any event, that information would come to CervicalCheck and the pause is that the look-back or review is not done and communicated over that period.  It is to be a very short period, as I understand it.  In all likelihood it will be much shorter than the period that would normally arise from the woman being diagnosed and the result becoming available.  I will use some very rough figures but it is not 3,000.  If there are 300 diagnoses in a year on average and, for example, half of them have a screening history - I am using very rough figures now - we are talking about 150, and if that is spread over the course of a full year, we are talking about ten or so in any single month.<\/p><p>That means over two months or so approximately 20 cases have to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#UU02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":985,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Connolly, I simply do not understand the psychology of pausing something that was working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#VV00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>It was working but not as effectively as we believed it could be.

Now what happens is that people take the job and do it for several years.  However, they would still like to see a country and experience travel and so they go abroad.  At the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, Ms Collette Cowan, who is the chief executive officer of the University of Limerick hospital group, explained the approach.  She said the important thing is that when the hospital staff get someone in from college, they get the graduate accustomed to the work.  Then they get the recruit to make a connection with the hospital.  Crucially, they offer a career break.  If they do not make a career break available then, when the recruit goes it is a break and she does not come back.  We will always see people leaving.

Deputy O'Connell has raised an important point about where we want to go, which is also dear to my heart.

From my perspective, this means empowering local clinical directors, at local level not just at group level, to have as much delegated responsibility and authority as possible.  That includes budgetary authority as much as possible and responsibility for the team.  We do not have this on a universal basis, but it is in some places in Ireland.  To my mind, this is a good direction to aim for.  I say this because the kinds of decisions that are made at local level cannot really be made 15 or 20 miles away.  One needs to be able to make decisions as they happen on the ground with regard to staff, team deployment, team working, analysing the workload ahead and sorting out the resources appropriately.  To answer the Deputy's question, if we can get interest for that type of delegation, and if we can put in the appropriate training to make it happen, then this will be a good thing to look forward to in the future.

We are very strongly supportive of that.<\/p> <p>  We are doing some things in advance of the finalisation of the implementation plan.  As we discussed earlier, we have opened negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on a new GP contract.  A key priority for us in that would be chronic disease management, so that somebody with diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, would not have to wait for an exacerbation of their condition and end up in hospital but would have it managed in primary care.  We are also rolling out community nursing and in particular advanced nursing in the community.  Somebody with asthma or another respiratory problem such as COPD would have an advanced nurse that would be trained in respiratory illnesses and, under a protocol, either in the primary care centre or in somebody's home they would be able to visit them over the course of a year and prevent their admission into hospital.<\/p> <p>  When we look at the type of money that we spend as a country, we have now reached a point where we are spending at least the average if not above the average.  In total terms we spend the eight highest of OECD countries.  In terms of public expenditure we spend the 12th highest of OECD countries but we do not manage as well as some others because we have people who are not accessing services in the right way and we need to develop primary care and make sure it is more accessible.  We have done the research on this, and if we do not do that, when we look at the capacity we will need to put in place to respond to an ageing population, we just could not afford the type of numbers of acute hospital beds that we would have to put in place to continue with the model we have got.  It is not even a case of affordability.  We could not staff them or find space on the hospital sites that we have got, so we have to put the emphasis on primary care and also to put a statutory scheme in place for home care.  There is a clear consensus now across all areas of the House in relation to that and it is one that we would be very anxious to deliver on with colleagues in the HSE over the next ten years to try to realise that vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#ZZ00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>This will be rolled out with the help of GPs who will provide the primary care.

This came up at the committee in February.  I subsequently asked the Minister for Health a parliamentary question about whose job it was to ensure the consultants comply with their contract.  The reply I received from the Minister on 14 February said it was the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are enforced.  Mr. Connaghan gave us some details about the percentage of inpatient discharges that are private versus public.  If the HSE's managers had been doing their job, there would have been no need to hire private security firms.  It looks as if when the HSE went to court, it could not prove its case around the mix of public and private because its hospital managers were not doing their job to start with.  It could not verify or stand over them, which is why it had to go to an external source.  <\/p> <p>  What robust measures are in place to ensure hospital managers make sure the consultants comply with the contracts in their area?
