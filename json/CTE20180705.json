He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We are dealing with the Department of Health and the HSE under the Department of Health appropriation accounts, Vote 38 for 2016 and the HSE financial statements 2017.  However, the committee decided to provide up to one hour at the beginning of the meeting to deal specifically with the cervical cancer crisis issue.  We will proceed with our examination of the financial statements after that.  We will take the routine business of the committee in the afternoon.<\/p><p>There are a number of items relevant to this morning's meeting in correspondence which I am putting on the record so they can be discussed in detail in public.

Next is correspondence No. 1460<b><\/b>from Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, providing his opening statement.  It is noted and published.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 1427<b><\/b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 25 June 2018, provides information on the management of legal costs and open disclosure as requested by the committee on 14 June 2018.  Mr. Breen's correspondence deals with the State Claims Agency management approach to CervicalCheck cancer misdiagnosis litigation; and details including the status of screening and non-screening cancer misdiagnosis claims for cervical cancer, bowel cancer and breast cancer.  We note and publish this.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Correspondence No. 1432<b><\/b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE is in respect of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s access to CervicalCheck records.

We have a relevant note on the screen.  We are not having a discussion; it is just by way of information.  It states in respect of the point about CervicalCheck attendees that at this point it is important to advise the committee that Charles O'Hanlon is on sick leave and certified unwell and, therefore, will not be in a position to attend the committee.<\/p><p>In respect of Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, she is employed by Holles Street and indicated that she is no longer with the HSE.  Since our meeting last week we have written to Dr. Flannelly in her course of employment and she sent an email back to the committee, reference 1451, which we note and publish.  Dr. Flannelly was the clinical director of CervicalCheck.  In her email, she thanks the committee for the invitation to appear before it on a voluntary witness basis to address the issues regarding the CervicalCheck programme.  She states that she is at present preparing to meet with Dr. Scally as part of his investigation next week, and that she is currently in the UK where she has work commitments until the middle of next week.  That is now this week.  She goes on to state that she would value the opportunity to help our committee by attending as per our request on a voluntary basis but in view of the above she requests that this be rearranged to a different date.  She states that she will liaise with the clerk in respect of rescheduling it.<\/p><p>I want to put on record that while she is not here today, Dr. Flannelly has given a definite commitment that she is happy to meet with us at a more suitable time.  I think we will have to come back to that.  We will discuss the timing of our meetings as part of our work programme in the afternoon.  We will not set the time now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#C00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>We should ask if she will come in next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#C00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We made a request last week for specific individuals.

As of 9 o'clock this morning, how many women have been identified as having been affected?  That figure was at 209.<\/p> <p>  It has been reported that the independent review of the cases of 3,000 women will not be completed on schedule and is only commencing now.  What is the reason for that?  Why has it taken so long?  If there were 300,000 slides per year and it takes five minutes to review each, a team of ten people could carry out the analysis in a few weeks even if each slide is surveyed twice and the women's slide history examined.  Why was there a commitment to complete the review within a timeframe which has not been followed?  Why was information on the delay not made public?  Why is the review only starting now?  It will not be possible for it to form part of the Scally review, which must be completed by the end of August.  The Minister for Health, stated that the final Scally review must be completed by the end of August.  However, these 3,000 slides will not be part of it because of the delay.  Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, who gave evidence to the committee, are extremely disappointed and upset this morning that the review of the slides will not form part of the Scally review.  Why was the review committed to on the basis of an unrealistic timeframe?  When will it be completed?  How in the name of God can we have a situation where Dr. Scally must report by the end of August to ensure credibility but this review will not form part of his report because of the delay?  How will his review be complete without that information?  How in the name of God did we end up in this situation?  Who committed to those unrealistic timelines?<\/p> <p>  I have a third question which I had better ask before the Chair cuts me off.  It relates to the legal cases, of which I understand there is a significant number.  I remind the witnesses that the State Claims Agency, SCA, will appear before the committee next week.  As I understand it, the HSE hired a legal firm, the identity of which I know, to draft a protocol for how cytology slides are given to the women affected.  That protocol has been in use for several weeks.  Solicitors for several affected women have gone to court to seek the release of the slides and in such cases the HSE has handed them over without the protocol being followed.  These are urgent cases.  All present know what that means: the women are in difficult health situations.  Why is a protocol needed for the release of slides to which the women are entitled?  Why is it taking so long?  Why can the protocol be bypassed when a woman goes to court and takes on CervicalCheck and it or the SCA is so embarrassed that it hands over the slides?  Some 80 to 90 women have sought their files from CervicalCheck and some have received access thereto.<\/p><p>When it comes to getting their slides they are being blocked by a protocol, which I doubt anyone has heard of up to now.  Given what the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, said in the D&aacute;il and the evidence given to this committee and the Joint Committee on Health, of which I am also a member, why is this protocol necessary?  What is its purpose?  If it can be bypassed in urgent cases why can it not be bypassed in this instance and these slides given to the women and their solicitors immediately?

If a monetary value is attached to non-disclosure in at least one case, it may also be attached in others.

They separated two elements, telling us that the medical files were one matter, while the slides were another.  I have examined the contracts with Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology.  They are similar, if not identical.  Under the heading of \"Storage and Disaster Recovery\" on page 12, the contractor shall at the request of the national screening service forward eligible samples stored by the contractor or on the contractor's behalf to the national screening service or any third party specified by the service in a manner prescribed by it within three working days.  It seems clear from this that the national screening service is in control and ownership of the slides.  Why is there any question of a delay when the contract is clear about the contractors' obligations and the service's rights?<\/p> <p>  On radio in the past half hour, the solicitor for Vicky Phelan stated the HSE was holding up the protocol to agree to the release of slides and that, until this occurred, they could not be reviewed by clinical cytologists.  Is the HSE holding it up and, if so, why?  <\/p> <p>  Someone made reference to an apology, but an apology is hollow if it is not followed through with actions that will give it meaning.  We are being given the runaround on some of our questions.  The contract is clear, but we are not being given clear answers about the protocol.  If it is being held up, any claim about dealing sincerely with people who may have been harmed by the State is hollow.

As shown in Figure 1, on members&rsquo; screens, HSE direct expenditure on pay and pensions accounted for over one third of the expenditure, totalling &euro;5.36 billion.  This included around &euro;300 million paid for agency staff services.  Grants to section 38 and section 39 agencies accounted for just over a quarter of the expenditure and totalled &euro;4 billion.  Expenditure on primary care and medical card schemes, including drugs refund schemes, accounted for a fifth of the expenditure, or just under &euro;3 billion.<br\/><br\/>The HSE recorded income for the year totalling &euro;15.1 billion.  The bulk of this - 94% - came in the form of a revenue grant paid to the HSE out of the Vote for the Department of Health.  The balance of the income comprises charges to patients using HSE services, and a range of miscellaneous sources, including employee pension contributions paid by HSE staff and the proceeds of pension-related deductions in the health sector, which the HSE retains.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the increase in income in 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s outturn for the year was a net operating deficit of &euro;140 million - a significant deterioration year on year.  The 2016 deficit was &euro;10 million.  The operating deficit in a year represents an effective first call on the following year&rsquo;s recurrent grant funding provided from the Vote.<br\/><br\/>The HSE financial statements also include a capital income and expenditure account.  For 2017, this recorded income of &euro;462 million, mainly comprising capital grants from the Vote.  Expenditure in the year totalled &euro;454 million, resulting in a net capital surplus of &euro;8 million, which the HSE carried forward to 2018.  A capital surplus of &euro;15 million was brought forward from 2016 into 2017 but the HSE had not obtained formal ministerial sanction to do so<b>, <\/b>as is required under the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014.<br\/><br\/>The audit report on the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 financial statement drew attention to a continued significant level of non-competitive procurement by the HSE.  We found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in regard to 36% of a sample of &euro;51 million worth of goods and services procured in 2017, spread across five HSE locations.  This is consistent with our findings in similar testing for many years past.  The HSE&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control outlines the steps it is taking to deal with this problem but states that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.  <br\/><br\/>The audit report also drew attention to inadequate monitoring and oversight of HSE grants to outside agencies, which is a continuing concern.<br\/><br\/>Members will recall last October examining chapter 19 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2016, which reviewed the HSE&rsquo;s framework for monitoring grants to service providers in the context of the audit of the 2016 financial statements of the HSE.  Our work for the 2017 audit, and that of the HSE&rsquo;s own internal audit, found that similar weaknesses recurred in 2017.  The HSE acknowledges the audit findings in the 2017 statement on internal control.<br\/><br\/>The appropriation account for Vote 38 - Health - before the committee relates to 2016.

The other item on today&rsquo;s agenda, the HSE financial statements 2017, will be addressed in the first instance by Mr. Connaghan, as the accountable person for those accounts.<\/p> <p>  Since 2015, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, funding of the HSE is provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health - Vote 38.  Accordingly, in 2016 the Department was responsible for a budget of &euro;13.649 billion for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to the HSE and to research, consultative and advisory bodies.  The budget includes the additional &euro;500 million provided by Government in 2016 to the health Vote, by way of mid-year adjustment, to improve the base funding of the Department of Health.  This succeeded in 2016 with the health Vote coming in under budget by &euro;2.221 million without recourse to a Supplementary Estimate.  <\/p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2016 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department such as the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the HIQA and a range of other bodies.  In 2016, the Department had 400 staff.  The Department&rsquo;s role is to provide strategic leadership for the health service and to ensure Government policies are translated into actions and implemented effectively.  We support the Minister and Ministers of State in their implementation of Government policy and in discharging their governmental, parliamentary and departmental duties.  <\/p> <p>  Much of the public debate tends to be on weaknesses in our health services.  Identifying measures to address these in association with our colleagues in the HSE undoubtedly demands continuing work on the part of the staff of the Department.  However, we also have other roles.  Importantly, we seek to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, we work cross-sectorally to achieve this objective.  Our life expectancy, at 81.8 years, is now one year above the OECD average but there is much more that can be done to better promote health and prevent ill-health.  We also work internationally with EU colleagues and the World Health Organization on health issues.  Considerable work is under way with the EU and the United Kingdom to address the health challenges caused by Brexit and to ensure that North-South and east-west co-operation on health matters is maintained.  We also support the Minister and Ministers of State in their work including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2017 the Department processed over 11,000 parliamentary questions, representing 22% of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across Government. <\/p> <p>  The 2016 gross provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;14.109 billion.  The 2016 outturn was almost &euro;14.107 billion, leaving an overall saving of &euro;2 million.  Of the 2016 gross provision for current expenditure, &euro;205 million was provided to the Department-related subheads in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to agencies under the aegis of the Department, other than the HSE.  The 2016 outturn for these subheads was &euro;176 million, giving an underspend of &euro;29 million, and &euro;13.387 billion of the 2016 gross provision for current expenditure was provided to HSE related subheads.  The 2016 outturn for these subheads was &euro;13.405 billion giving an overspend of &euro;18 million.  The overspend primarily related to funding the existing level of service in both acute and community services and pension costs.  This overspend was met from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  The 2016 provision for capital expenditure was &euro;516 million and the 2016 outturn was &euro;525 million.  However, funding was transferred by means of virement to the capital subheads from savings elsewhere in the Vote to provide for capital developments at mental health facilities.  The 2016 appropriations-in-aid to the health Vote was on profile at &euro;460 million.  The end year net outturn for current and capital was &euro;13.647 billion against a net provision of &euro;13.649 billion, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of &euro;2 million. <\/p> <p>  The Department continues to develop its policy and performance oversight in respect of a range of complex services falling within total public health expenditure.  We are working on a significant reform agenda in line with the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  This includes, as an initial important step, legislative proposals approved by Government to improve governance within the HSE through the introduction of a competency-based governing board this year.  Subsequent policy development is likely to see a strong national centre but with greater devolution of decision-making and accountability, including financial accountability, to regional integrated care organisations.  The further development and linkage of corporate and clinical governance at all levels within the health service, again in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report, will be a priority in ensuring the delivery of effective, safe and accountable health services. <\/p> <p>  I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas generally on this objective and am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I will introduce the senior management members with me today.  They are Mr. Stephen Mulvany, Mr. Liam Woods and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and I will therefore confine my opening remarks to a number of issues, the first of which is the financial outturn for 2017.  A Revised Estimate for health was approved and notified by letter of determination of 29 December 2017.  The HSE received once-off revenue funding of &euro;208.3 million to cover winter initiatives, State Claims Agency increased costs, the shortfall of acute hospital private patient income and central pay awards.  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2017 record a combined revenue and capital deficit of &euro;131.5 million.  Within this there is a capital surplus of &euro;8.3 million and a revenue deficit of &euro;139.9 million.  The total 2017 revenue deficit when deficits in section 38-funded providers are taken account of is &euro;165.9 million.<\/p> <p>  The most significant area of deficit in 2017 relates to the acute hospital division which was &euro;139.7 million.  The majority of this deficit - &euro;73 million - is attributable to income shortfalls and associated bad debt costs primarily related to hospital private maintenance charges.  In addition, there are cost overruns of 0.4% equivalent to &euro;13.4 million on pay and &euro;54 million or 3% related to non-pay of which the majority - &euro;44 million - relate to clinical non-pay.  A significant driver of these cost overruns is the provision of additional activity in response to service demand, the complexity of that activity and the growing age and related needs of hospital inpatients.  As evidenced within the health service capacity review 2018, Ireland reported the second highest occupancy rate of those countries reporting to the OECD.  This indicates a hospital system that is operating under considerable stress and which is short of the necessary capacity. <\/p> <p>  Social care services reported a deficit of &euro;24.5 million.  A significant element of the deficit in this area relates to the costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability, including the provision of emergency placements which continue to be a significant pressure in 2018.  Individual placements can cost up to &euro;0.5 million.  The costs of compliance with HIQA residential standards in the intellectual disability sector has also been a contributory factor in the deficit.  <\/p> <p>  To put the HSE&rsquo;s financial performance in context, if we look back over the ten years from 2008 to 2017, there has been 0.68% or &euro;838 million in net Supplementary Estimates provided to the HSE in respect of areas directly related to service pressures and financial performance challenges.  The balance of supplementary funding over this period has been in respect of Exchequer-related or technical items outside of the HSE&rsquo;s control.  That is equivalent to 1.56% or &euro;1.9 billion.  It includes the PCRS at &euro;0.791 million or 0.64%, whose costs are largely driven by policy, legislation and related demographic and societal factors not amenable to normal financial management. <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to matters of exception reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of 2017.<\/p><p>In the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate which accompanies the annual financial statement the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to concerns about the monitoring and oversight arrangements for grants to outside agencies, non-competitive procurement issues and also noted that the HSE had not received sanction from the Minister for Health for the capital surplus brought forward from 2016.  The HSE acknowledges these matters of concern and is progressing medium to long-term plans required to bring about improvements as follows.<\/p><p> I shall turn first to the issue of non-compliant procurement.  The HSE incurs procurable expenditure in excess of &euro;2.2 billion annually.  Given the scale and complexity of the HSE&rsquo;s overall procurement activity, it has been highlighted and acknowledged at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and by my predecessor that it will take a sustained effort over a number of years to ensure high levels of compliance.  This is a key focus for the HSE.  The HSE, through its health business services, HBS, procurement function, continues to progress a transformational programme of reform of its procurement arrangements to improve compliance with public procurement regulations, increase the usage of contracts, put frameworks in place by it and liaise with the Office of Government Procurement.  The HBS procurement function works closely with the Office of Government Procurement.  There have been a number of successful tender outcomes, particularly in the utilities category such as electricity, fuel oil, gas, telecommunications and vehicles.  We also know that there is a considerable amount of work ahead in cleaning, security and professional services.  This collaborative effort is achieving value for money and contributing to an increase in overall procurement compliance and the development of the overall procurement reform programme.<\/p><p> The HSE is implementing a number of initiatives which are organised around three key themes: supporting infrastructure; sourcing and compliance.  Further detail of the steps being taken to address the issue of non-compliant procurement are published in the statement of internal control within the 2017 annual financial statements.<\/p><p> On the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies, the HSE has consistently acknowledged the positive role the voluntary sector plays in the development and delivery of health and personal social services.  The HSE is also acutely aware of the need for the appropriate level of oversight of the grants provided for outside agencies.  In 2017 just under &euro;4.1 billion of the HSE&rsquo;s total expenditure was related to grants to more than 2,000 outside agencies.  The agencies range from the large voluntary hospitals and disability organisations to small local community-based agencies.<\/p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s governance framework is consistent with the management and accountability requirements for grants provided from Exchequer funding as set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Circular 13\/2014.  Weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies have previously been identified.  The HSE continues to take the necessary actions to address these weaknesses.  The national compliance unit which was established in 2014 supports the development of improved grant oversight by community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and hospital groups which have delegated responsibility for the management of the relationship with outside agencies at operational level.<\/p><p> Improved oversight has raised the level of compliance by grant funded agencies.  An example of the actions already taken is the external review of governance arrangements for section 38 providers  which is under way.  The purpose of these reviews is to confirm that appropriate governance arrangements are in place and aligned with those set out in the annual compliance statements provided by section 38 agencies for the HSE.  The main compliance issues identified in the review process relate to procurement, HR legacy issues and a need, in some instances, to establish an appropriate internal audit function.  It is expected that the external reviews commissioned will be completed by October.  Agencies will provide status reports on the progress made in addressing issues and such issues will be included in local operational oversight.  The HSE is committed to implementing a five year rolling programme that will prioritise section 38 agencies not reviewed in the current programme.  It will be extended to include the larger section 39 agencies.  Further details of the steps being taken to address the issue of weaknesses are published in the statement of internal control within the 2017 annual financial statements.<\/p><p> It would be remiss of me not to look ahead and consider the role of healthcare transformation and how we employ the HSE's assets and resources.  As is the case in many developed health systems, we face the challenge of growing user expectations, unmet need and core infrastructural deficits.  For many years we have been aware of the need for a shift in health service delivery in order to move from the more traditional focus of treatment and cure to that of prevention and treatment, when required.  The current arrangements for service delivery in Ireland are characterised by an over-reliance on more costly, hospital-based care, with continuing opportunities to deliver care more appropriately in primary and community settings.  There are challenges in responding effectively to the planned, unplanned and emergency needs of patients in hospitals.<\/p><p> Similar pressures are faced by services in primary and community services, including services for people with disabilities and people who need mental health support, with demand outstripping supply in many areas.  In addition, there is a growing need to maintain or replace our current infrastructure and equipment.  I am pleased to note that I am a personal supporter of the Sl&aacute;intecare report which signals a new direction of travel in relation to eligibility, delivery and the funding of health and social care in Ireland into the future.  We are implementing a range of programmes to prepare the ground for longer term transformation in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are tens of thousands of dedicated staff working in health services, changing practices, improving care for patients, advocating for and driving service improvements day in and day out.  Staff and management working locally are providing leadership and support for nationally supported initiatives, with the aim of reforming services and seeking to deliver higher value care.  A number of transformational programmes are continuing in 2018, with a particular focus on four key themes, the first of which is improving population health and well-being by keeping people well and reducing the incidence of ill health and supporting people to live as independently as possible.  The second theme is delivering care closer to home, with the intent of meeting the vast majority of the population&rsquo;s healthcare needs in more local settings, with institutional and hospital-based care being reserved for only those individuals who require complex, specialised, emergency care and even then only for the shortest time possible.  The third theme is the development of specialist hospital care networks by progressing numerous workstreams in our national clinical and integrated care programmes.  The fourth theme is the improvement of quality, safety and value by building support for effective care that is delivered according to best evidence of what is clinically effective in improving health outcomes by reducing variations in how care is delivered and developing skills and capacity for quality improvement in healthcare delivery settings.  In addition, we are developing structures and reconfiguring teams within the HSE to strengthen our approach to population need assessment, demographic analysis and the utilisation of service design in order to develop more equitable and effective resource allocation models, particularly for primary and community services.  This goes hand in hand with Mr. Breslin's statement on geo-alignments and local devolved responsibility.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s public health service was designed for a time when we had a different demographic profile.  Today the expectations surrounding clinical governance and standards have never been higher.  The population, however, is older.  Modelling forecasts tell us that the number of people aged over 65 years will increase by nearly 110,000 in the next five years.  The fact that people are living longer is great news, but a large proportion of this older age group now live with two or more chronic conditions which make many of them more vulnerable and frail.  This has a consequential impact on resources.  In that context, the imminent publication of the Department of Health&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan provides a powerful opportunity to create much needed strategic certainty for the health and social care delivery system in Ireland.  We are committed to working with the Government and the Department to do this and implement the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>We shall start the question and answer session with Deputy David Cullinane who has 20 minutes.

It might be better if I start with the position over the last six months to a year.  Let us understand the impacts of what we have seen over the last winter, going back to the last part of 2017.  We know we had the worst flu season for ten years.  The health service coped adequately with that but it did drive additional costs in terms of isolation, intensive care unit, ICU, costs and extended lengths of stay and intensity.  That is one factor.  We also had some of the worst trolley figures ever over the course of the last six months, although taken year on year, as Mr. Woods stated to the health committee yesterday, we are roughly the same.  That period drove some really quite exceptional costs.  I had to make some decisions during that time in the interests of patient safety in terms of sourcing additional capacity, authorising things like weekend and overtime work just to ensure we could get people out of hospitals appropriately.

The behaviour of insurers around that gave rise to a probable &euro;73 million of the total, which was &euro;139.7 million.  On the service delivery side, the biggest driver last year both in terms of growth year on year and against budget was the non-pay clinical costs of treating patients.  That was a &euro;44 million figure within a total service deficit of &euro;67 million.  Driving those costs are two factors, namely, the volume of care provided, which is increasing, and the complexity of care.  They underlie what is going on in the hospital system operationally.<\/p> <p>  The other factor the director general mentioned is that there was a &euro;13 million challenge against the pay budget.  That is against a pay base of over &euro;3 billion.  There are a couple of factors driving pay.  One is that it would include agency and locum costs, so the specialing within the hospital system of cases that have high-intensity need around the clock is a factor.  That is growing as an element of cost.  Clearly, effective movement to community of people who are fit for discharge is an important piece in managing that.  That is a driver.  The other is to control the total numbers of those employed within the health environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Woods and Mr. Connaghan.  That gives me answers as to why there was a deficit.  Essentially, Mr. Woods is saying the two main drivers in terms of acute hospital spend were that the volume of care has increased as has the complexity, which I imagine is things like unexpected flu outbreaks and so on, resulting in greater isolation and containment needs.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Connaghan also mentioned the trolley figures.  I imagine they reflect increased demand with more people looking for beds when there are not enough beds.  We know that.  The more demand and pressure on hospitals, the more spend there will be.  However, why is that not forecast?  Why was it not built in to the estimation of the spend?  Were the circumstances really exceptional?  Were they outliers or were they potentially foreseen?  Did we just not allocate enough money in last year's voted expenditure to health to cover what should have been the amount given to make sure we were in a position to properly treat patients?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#Q00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>To give a direct answer to a very direct question as to whether the activity was expected, in terms of emergency department, ED, attendances over the period, I am talking about those who were over 75 years old because when we look at the cost we tend to think there is more cost associated with the elderly than with those who are perhaps in their 30s.  Over the time period, ED attendances of people aged 75 years and older were up 6.7% and ED admissions over that period were up by 6.4% for the over 75s.  ED attendances across the whole population were up 4.8% so there is considerable pressure that I do not think was anticipated at the start of the year.  The other factor, which is important in relation to those who are over 75, is that it is quite clear - and this is very welcome - that with the population living longer, there are more patients presenting with more complex needs inside our hospital system.  There are some marvellous studies available about the level of comorbidity or multiple chronic conditions currently in the population.  I think I said in my opening statement that this is a factor, so the complexity of care is also increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I want to come now to agency staff, which Mr. Woods mentioned as being one of the issues.

Agency is essential at times, but there are parts of the country where the cost premium - Mr. Woods talked about the average - can be higher, particularly in respect of medical agency.  The issue is the market and the availability.  To be very clear for Deputies, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the cost of agency.  Not only are there cost issues associated with it, there is also not as much continuity of care.

I ask that this be addressed in the context of whatever briefing paper is given to us as well.<\/p> <p>  On a related matter, I wish to come to one of the regional issues.  I gave prior notice to Mr. Connaghan that I would raise this issue.  A briefing note on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, was given to Oireachtas Members in the south east.  Waterford and Wexford form one catchment area for CAMHS.  We had five child psychiatrist positions at University Hospital Waterford last year.  One of the psychiatrists retired and three resigned citing workload, poor infrastructure and not being listened to.  They resigned out of frustration and annoyance at not getting answers to questions they were putting.  The briefing note I have been given by the Department states that with effect from Friday, 6 July, there will only be one consultant paediatric psychiatrist employed in the Waterford area and that person will be on annual leave from 9 July 2018, which was pre-booked in April.  In other words, we will have no child psychiatrist at all in Waterford - none.  The only service being supplied at the moment is an agency consultant coming from Galway to do a clinic at weekends.  The actual child psychiatrist provision and the resultant care they would give to people is almost non-existent.<\/p> <p>  How did it get to the sorry state that we are left with one child psychiatrist in one hospital?  This is an issue throughout the State.  The briefing note also states there is difficulty in recruiting child psychiatrists.  How did we end up in a situation whereby three psychiatrists resigned, with the reasons they have given, not on Mr. Connaghan's watch but certainly on the HSE's watch, and whereby for a period there will be no cover whatsoever in one of our major acute hospitals?

Why was corrective action not taken?  Now the HSE is left scrambling to look internationally, doing conference calls and all the other work to fill the posts whereas the HSE had people in posts and they felt it was so bad that they walked away.  In fact, I heard one of them on national radio in a very distressed state, almost feeling guilty that he walked away from his post, but felt he had no choice because people in power, people with responsibility for delivering services, were not listening to him.  How does Mr. Connaghan respond to him and to the patients who are now being left without a service?  Whatever is being done now is great, and the HSE has to do its job to fill those posts, but Mr. Connaghan has to account for why those people left in the first place and why, as we sit here, patients in Waterford and elsewhere, young people, are not getting the services they should get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#R01700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to be aware of the reasons for that.

We seem to have an increased dependency on section 38 organisations, which is possibly part of the problem.

The HSE itself cannot pick up the slack if corrective action is taken.<\/p><p> Mr. Connaghan said in his opening statement that the purpose of these reviews is to confirm that appropriate governance arrangements are in place.  I would argue that the weaknesses in governance are not the problem.  They are part of the problem.  Enforcement is a problem.

One is the hospice in Harold's Cross.  There is a report on that which we have not got to yet, though we will.  Is Mr. Connaghan satisfied that the sanctions are robust enough to make sure that we do not have recurring issues with governance failures and misspending of money by these section 38 organisations?

It looks very different from what I understand was in place a couple of years ago.  We have a service arrangement in detail and an annual agreement with penalties for late completion in place for section 38 and larger section 39 bodies.  We have grant aid agreements for section 39 organisations.  Against that background, we have an annual compliance statement which covers things like governance, risk, pay policy, tax and procurement which comes from each of these organisations.

Mr. Breslin said that in 2017, the Department processed more than 11,000 parliamentary questions, 22% of all parliamentary questions for Ministers across Government.  I know from my experience that practically everything I table in parliamentary questions to the Department of Health receives a one line reply, referring it to the HSE.  I am not asking Mr. Breslin to do it now, but will he give us a breakdown of that 22%, indicating how many go to the HSE?  It probably overstates the amount of work that falls on the Department and understates the work that falls on the HSE in responding to questions.  Many of the questions that I pose which go to the HSE can take some time to come back.  It would be useful to hear from the HSE the quantum of work relating to parliamentary questions.  If that is not available now, it would be quite useful for us to get information.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions relating to how money is spent when people are in an acute hospital because there is inadequate provision of home care packages, although I know it is always finite.

Like most other Deputies, we look at people coming through the door in our constituency offices.  We see the kinds of challenges that people face.

The good news is that 70% of them are being carried out within four months, which is positive.  It is slightly down on last year when it was slightly higher.  The bad news, however, is that 28% of children are waiting more than a year for speech and language therapy.  Some 50% of all the assessments that are currently outstanding are in the CHO 4 area.<\/p> <p>  In terms of CAMHS, in March this year there were 2,691 people waiting for assessment, which was a 15% increase since September 2017.  Some 14% of them, 386 people, are waiting more than a year.  Of those, 55% are in the CHO 4 area.  Regarding assessments of needs, in March this year there were 4,242 people waiting for assessments.  Of those, 80% are waiting beyond the statutory timeframe of three months.  Again, 50% of them are in the CHO 4 area.  Clearly this area has issues which need to be addressed.  Do the witnesses have any comments on this area within the organisation?  It is falling far behind everywhere else across the board in terms of speech and language, CAMHS and assessments of needs.  Can the director general tell me the reason?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#U01600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>For any child to wait longer than is necessary is a tragedy.  Looking at some of the other services aside from the ones outlined by the Deputy today, clearly our position is not one we would want to readily accept.

We understand the gravity of the question the Deputy is asking.<\/p> <p>  There was some investment in this area in 2016 and 2017.  I realise it is difficult to attract staff to certain locations.  We need to do more in terms of providing cross-regional support, so if there is one CHO that is in trouble because it cannot attract and retain staff or where we do not have the right mix we must do more.  Looking at the statistics here, it is 50% in CHO 4 but it is nothing in CHO 1 or CHO 2, for example.  The question is what we can do to provide cross cover.  That is the first issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is due to meet officials soon and we will wait to see what action plan comes out of that.

Nobody could say that every euro is used as effectively as it could be by the HSE.  That is the experience of health services the world over.  We have some distance to go to ensure that we are best in class in the delivery of services.  The expanding and aging population is placing us under pressure to grow services and that pressure will continue.  Waiting for additional money to fall through the letter box every year for investment in new services will not be sufficient to address the demand for those services.  We must also consider how our services are organised and how productive they are.  That is at the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare report to which Mr. Connaghan made reference.  One often finds that individual parts of the service are working productively but that services are not properly joined up and the right services are not being offered in the right places.  Taking the example made earlier, a person waiting for a year for speech and language therapy will experience developmental delay as a result and his or her requirements, when eventually seen, will be significantly more complex than would have been the case had earlier treatment been provided.  Putting resources into a primary care community setting for far more accessible care can often help us avoid some of the more expensive approaches of highly specialist care such as acute hospital care and so on.  That is key to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  Also of significant importance is working very smartly, using information and technology and doing things really well.

I thank the Deputy for his kind opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  What examples do we have of the ability of the health service right now in Ireland to pursue good value for money?  That was the first question.  The second question is: how can we spread that best practice throughout Ireland?  I will consider the three different types of value-for-money activity in terms of our pursuit of better value for the public purse.  One is what I would call the usual suspects.  They are the basic things that are non-clinical in essence.  They are good procurement, conversion of agency posts into full-time and substantive posts, efficiencies in back office services such as print, energy and postage, and shared non-clinical front-line services.  We do not need to have 29 or 56 of everything for Ireland.  They are things that are being pursued right now by each CHO and each hospital group.  That is the first category.  One must understand that the first category only touches a certain element of the cost base.  One needs to look beyond it in terms of being able to look at the entire &euro;15.2 billion.<\/p> <p>  The second category I will draw the committee's attention to is clinical efficiency.  We need to do a lot more in that regard.  Clinical efficiency does not mean we need to get our clinicians to work harder - although maybe in some cases we do - but to work smarter with better technology and more modern methods of delivery of services where we help clinicians to do that.  An example is the pursuit of theatre efficiency.  We know if we were to arrange things better and look at the best performing theatre system in Ireland we would probably get more throughput but to do that we would probably need some investment in things like theatre systems and new and innovative ways of working.  That is an example of clinical efficiency.<\/p> <p>  The third and biggest area, which is where most of the &euro;15 billion would lie, is in what I would call efficiencies associated with the model of care.  I will boil that down into a couple of big things.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a hook here.  One of the big hooks is the separation of elective and unscheduled care.  I came from a system where we had developed that over a five-year period.  What we found by separating elective and unscheduled care was much greater efficiency in terms of throughput because it was unrestricted and not stopped by the vagaries of winter.  Where there was protected elective time we could plan efficiency and throughput through a system, which in that case was protected.  The idea in Sl&aacute;intecare to do something with investment in that would drive better clinical efficiency.  Another example is we can do things differently.  Mr. Breslin made reference to the fact we are doing too much in acute systems.  If I take some of the examples such as the Sligo air care model or the Letterkenny urology model, which move activity out of the hospital system into the community, they mean faster delivery which is closer to home and also more efficient.  It allows clinicians in the acute system to concentrate on the things they need to concentrate on.  They are three buckets of things on which we can pursue value for money.  We are only part of the way down that road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Can I ask a more personal question?

If people in other Departments, particularly in other countries, are not up to scratch they are taken out or moved aside.

Many of them are doing a fantastic job every day of the week, particularly when it comes to times when the provision of healthcare to the nation is threatened such as during storms and snowfall.  Many of them are doing a fantastic job.  That is reflected in patient satisfaction surveys.  The Deputy raises a more fundamental point about the process in place to assess, in particular, senior managers and staff in responsible positions.  How do we assess whether The objectives they are meant to pursue in a year on a personal basis have been delivered?  We do not have such a system operating in the Irish healthcare system.

They had to say they would not work in the system that was in place.  I am told a bed management officer is needed for the south east, including Wexford, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  That would be an officer to manage the beds.  There is also a unit promised for Clonmel to relieve the pressure on Kilkenny.  The same is required in Wexford and Waterford.

Ms Phelan stated on radio, and to me privately as well, that the information was not being provided.  According to her conversation with Dr. Scally this morning, there was still information he was not getting, much information was being redacted, and there was much legal process before information was being provided and questions were not being answered.

I will just check again that that has been done.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Scally is comfortable in so far as he tells me that if there is something, particularly in relation to patient confidentiality - this will be very, very rare - we will take that out because we need to preserve some of the interests of the patients in this as well.  All of that should be provided.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the provision and searchability of documents, one of the things that hampered the position between Dr. Scally and the HSE right at the very outset was the different platforms that we had in terms of their use and searchability.  We have made recommendations - I think Dr. Scally has taken these board - that we invest in an appropriate eDiscovery platform which can search anything.  For the very few instances where we do not have original documentation that can be searched through the normal Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Pro, we can use eDiscovery platforms with OCR to be able to identify everything.

There is a fundamental issue here.  The lady who brought us to this stage is on national radio, on the most listened-to programme on radio in Ireland, stating that she heard in conversation with Dr. Scally this morning that the HSE is not co-operating fully.  That is merely a fact.  Everybody in Ireland who was listening heard it.  I listened to it after speaking to Ms Phelan.<\/p> <p>  I accept what Mr. Connaghan is saying.  Whatever is going on, it is not working.  There is not a hope in hell of Dr. Scally having a comprehensive report by the end of August.  I am saying it now - not a hope in hell.  We already know it will not be comprehensive because the 3,000 cases will not have been reviewed and that will not tally.  That means the report itself will not be comprehensive.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry but this is deeply unacceptable to the public watching the committee today.

If this protocol exists tomorrow, my confidence in the HSE as an organisation will have collapsed.  No legal protocol can be put in place that will take this length of time.  These women are entitled to their information.  Just, bloody well, give it to them.  If they go to the High Court, they will get it anyway because the HSE will be too embarrassed in front of a judge.  Will the HSE just give these 80 to 90 women the information they are all looking for?  Never mind about protocols, for dignity purposes give it to them.  Many of these women do not have the time.  Mr. Connaghan should just do that.<\/p> <p>  My third issue relating to the information provided is that the process for moving the HPV would be in place by October.

An assessment of the risk associated with each case is required to decide how we deploy that budget locally and individually, from what we have nationally.  Whether that is right or wrong and whether we have the risk assessment right all the time remains to be seen and that is open to challenge and it should be challenged because if it is not right we need to fix it.<\/p> <p>  The second point to consider is what will demand be like in the future.

There are two issues.  First, the insurers have taken a stance in the last two years around the timing of when we are entitled to charge in their view.  Our understanding of the legislation is very clear in that once the individual elects to be treated privately it is from the date of admission and the insurers are pursuing a line which says they will only pay from the date of a particular form being signed.  We have an entirely different view from that.  There is also what we would refer to as a campaign that the insurers are running, encouraging members not to use their insurance when admitted through the unscheduled care route into hospitals.

Over an extended period, both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department looked at that and said that was a major hidden subsidy to private healthcare within public hospitals because insurance companies were having their members treated in the public hospitals but because they did not get a single room, which is one of the cheaper parts of the total cost of a person's stay in a hospital, the insurance company was not paying for it.

The Minister for Health announced last week that he would deploy a modular catheterisation laboratory for University Hospital Waterford.  Mr. Connaghan knows that this has been a long-running issue.  An independent report carried out following the formation of the Government headed up by Dr. Niall Herity did not recommend a permanent second catheterisation laboratory at the hospital.  In any event, a modular laboratory will be deployed for a time period.  The Minister has stated the money will be made available in this year's budget but that there would be significant tendering, project design work, planning, construction and commissioning work.  Does Mr. Connaghan have the updated information because in his letter to Members of the Oireachtas, the Minister stated he had asked the HSE to commence the work of making this happen now?

To take the example of 2017, the Supplementary Estimate was &euro;195 million and some &euro;75 million of that figure was to do with the national pay deal, where the pay increases were brought forward.  In fairness, I have robust debate with the HSE on their finances, that is something that was imposed on them.  The Government met that cost.  There was a &euro;40 million Government initiative to try to improve winter responsiveness and try to open extra beds in acute hospitals and try to get home care levels increased.  Again that was a Government initiative.  Consequently, &euro;115 million from a total of &euro;195 million arose as a result of two Government decisions.<br\/><br\/>There was &euro;50 million for the State Claims Agency, with which members of this committee will be familiar and this reflects settlements and court settlements, which can be very significant.  One can have a &euro;10 million settlement and these figures can be both significant and unpredictable.  That is not say that we do not try to estimate them and try to provide funding for them but it is hard to get it exactly right.  The other area foe which the Supplementary Estimate was made available in 2017 was the area to which we have given some time, namely, the income area.  We provided &euro;30 million for that.  Above and beyond that Supplementary Estimate, last year there was a figure of &euro;140 million for the deficit that the HSE had generated at the end of the year.  I would see issues within that where again, although we made &euro;50 million available to the State Claims Agency, we got it wrong by &euro;10 million.  By the end of the year, during November and December, it was &euro;10 million above the figure we expected.  There are certainly other areas, where the Department would consider that it gets a budget that is set by the Government and which is based on the fiscal rules.  We are told that is the total amount of funding that is available for the health service and then we work with the HSE, outlining that it must come up with a service plan that can deliver the greatest value within a budget of &euro;15 billion.  There must be some areas of the health service, even though they are complex and difficult to manage, where people seek to manage their budget in such a way that by the end of the year, they do not have a deficit.  If there is not, the difficulty becomes that the people who have the deficit get that dealt with and the people who seek to manage without having a deficit have to bear it.  Although it is hard in the health service and there is demand that is hard to manage, we are seeking with the HSE to improve upon the budgetary discipline in the health service.<\/p><p> To bring it back to the Estimates process, we would look at each element of the HSE's budget with them.  As part of that we would engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then we would conclude a service plan.  I do know, in terms of Supplementary Estimates for example, that in previous years there were areas, perhaps pensions and retirements costs, demand-led schemes and fair deal schemes.  Where people seek to retire they must be paid their lump sum and these cases have been difficult to predict in advance.  Last year, no costs arose excess to what our predictions were in respect of areas like the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, pensions, demand-led schemes and fair deal schemes.  Last year, we did a better job in those areas and we continue to refine our methodologies.  Ultimately, it is the Oireachtas, on the recommendation of the Government, that decides the health budget but we and the HSE must come up with a service plan to deliver upon that.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#QQ01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I would say that it is the Government that decides, based on what the Government says the health budget is, rather than the Oireachtas but that is a moot point.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about next year's budget, which we do not know.

I think I have previously described the three tentative value elements to what the HSE is currently about.  One is what I would call the usual suspects, and I have gone over those, like print, postage, back office services, etc.  Right now the HSE is well engaged on that, with every CHO and every hospital group at national level, through what we are doing in terms of our procurement strategy.  The next bit is one where we are only partially engaged and we can do an awful lot more.  I would recall it is the clinical efficiency bit that I have previously explained.  That is doing things like increasing the level of day care surgery that we have.  That in itself leads me back to one of the drivers that we have in the national service plan.  We have always had, in the national service plan, a desire to do more for the amount of money that we have.  That is a good thing but the question is whether we are doing the right things.  Maybe it is not always right that we drive more activity through our hospitals.

The Deputy is right - a range of women were informed some significant time after they had been treated for cervical cancer that this was what was known about their previous smear test history.  Having got it up to date, there would still have been a time lag in the audit.  It is not that someone would be diagnosed today and told within a couple of weeks that we had looked at her smear test and that here was the result.  Dr. McKenna reflected that, rather than carrying out an audit that could be criticised and seen as inadequate, including by Dr. Scally who might say there was a problem with it, there would be a pause period of a couple of months.  The relevant individuals would be new diagnoses during that period.

I will bring it back to the beginning.  The trigger for an audit of a case is a diagnosis of cervical cancer and the CervicalCheck programme being informed that somebody has been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That is an individual notification.  CervicalCheck asks then if the person has a screening history.  On occasion the person will not have a screening history.  Where the person has a screening history the audit looks at the engagement with that person to see when CervicalCheck last engaged with the woman.  It is a case of whether they called her and whether she did not come, which is a possibility, or whether they called her and she came and she had a difficulty with the quality of the smear test, and it goes all the way through the chain.  The most important issue, however, is around the reading of the smear test and, after that has been looked at through a process to try to determine if there is a discordance, to communicate - this is where it fell down - that discordance to the woman's consultant who is treating her for cervical cancer, and for him or her to inform the woman that a previous smear had missed a screening potential to send her in for further review.<\/p> <p>  To bring that forward, as I understand it as a non-clinician, and it would be helpful if Dr. McKenna were here, the pause is for a period.  If somebody is diagnosed with cervical cancer, and there will be a lag in that information getting to CervicalCheck so there is always a lag in any event, that information would come to CervicalCheck and the pause is that the look-back or review is not done and communicated over that period.  It is to be a very short period, as I understand it.  In all likelihood it will be much shorter than the period that would normally arise from the woman being diagnosed and the result becoming available.  I will use some very rough figures but it is not 3,000.  If there are 300 diagnoses in a year on average and, for example, half of them have a screening history - I am using very rough figures now - we are talking about 150, and if that is spread over the course of a full year, we are talking about ten or so in any single month.<\/p><p>That means over two months or so approximately 20 cases have to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#UU02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":985,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Connolly, I simply do not understand the psychology of pausing something that was working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#VV00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530777600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>It was working but not as effectively as we believed it could be.

Now what happens is that people take the job and do it for several years.  However, they would still like to see a country and experience travel and so they go abroad.  At the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, Ms Collette Cowan, who is the chief executive officer of the University of Limerick hospital group, explained the approach.  She said the important thing is that when the hospital staff get someone in from college, they get the graduate accustomed to the work.  Then they get the recruit to make a connection with the hospital.  Crucially, they offer a career break.  If they do not make a career break available then, when the recruit goes it is a break and she does not come back.  We will always see people leaving.

Deputy O'Connell has raised an important point about where we want to go, which is also dear to my heart.

From my perspective, this means empowering local clinical directors, at local level not just at group level, to have as much delegated responsibility and authority as possible.  That includes budgetary authority as much as possible and responsibility for the team.  We do not have this on a universal basis, but it is in some places in Ireland.  To my mind, this is a good direction to aim for.  I say this because the kinds of decisions that are made at local level cannot really be made 15 or 20 miles away.  One needs to be able to make decisions as they happen on the ground with regard to staff, team deployment, team working, analysing the workload ahead and sorting out the resources appropriately.  To answer the Deputy's question, if we can get interest for that type of delegation, and if we can put in the appropriate training to make it happen, then this will be a good thing to look forward to in the future.

We are very strongly supportive of that.<\/p> <p>  We are doing some things in advance of the finalisation of the implementation plan.  As we discussed earlier, we have opened negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on a new GP contract.  A key priority for us in that would be chronic disease management, so that somebody with diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, would not have to wait for an exacerbation of their condition and end up in hospital but would have it managed in primary care.  We are also rolling out community nursing and in particular advanced nursing in the community.  Somebody with asthma or another respiratory problem such as COPD would have an advanced nurse that would be trained in respiratory illnesses and, under a protocol, either in the primary care centre or in somebody's home they would be able to visit them over the course of a year and prevent their admission into hospital.<\/p> <p>  When we look at the type of money that we spend as a country, we have now reached a point where we are spending at least the average if not above the average.  In total terms we spend the eight highest of OECD countries.  In terms of public expenditure we spend the 12th highest of OECD countries but we do not manage as well as some others because we have people who are not accessing services in the right way and we need to develop primary care and make sure it is more accessible.  We have done the research on this, and if we do not do that, when we look at the capacity we will need to put in place to respond to an ageing population, we just could not afford the type of numbers of acute hospital beds that we would have to put in place to continue with the model we have got.  It is not even a case of affordability.  We could not staff them or find space on the hospital sites that we have got, so we have to put the emphasis on primary care and also to put a statutory scheme in place for home care.  There is a clear consensus now across all areas of the House in relation to that and it is one that we would be very anxious to deliver on with colleagues in the HSE over the next ten years to try to realise that vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#ZZ00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>This will be rolled out with the help of GPs who will provide the primary care.

This came up at the committee in February.  I subsequently asked the Minister for Health a parliamentary question about whose job it was to ensure the consultants comply with their contract.  The reply I received from the Minister on 14 February said it was the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are enforced.  Mr. Connaghan gave us some details about the percentage of inpatient discharges that are private versus public.  If the HSE's managers had been doing their job, there would have been no need to hire private security firms.  It looks as if when the HSE went to court, it could not prove its case around the mix of public and private because its hospital managers were not doing their job to start with.  It could not verify or stand over them, which is why it had to go to an external source.  <\/p> <p>  What robust measures are in place to ensure hospital managers make sure the consultants comply with the contracts in their area?

Essentially this arises out of the merger of the colleges of education which took place when the former Church of Ireland College of Education became part of Dublin City University, DCU, along with St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Mater Dei Institute of Education in 2016.  Part of that arrangement was that there would be a reservation of places on the bachelor of education programme over the following five academic years to allow Church of Ireland or other schools with a minority reformed Christian ethos to have a flow of primary teachers.  A similar arrangement has been put in place and approved by the Oireachtas in 1999, 2003, 2008 and 2013.  This is consistent with our desire, as discussed in debates on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, to ensure that there is a place in our system for minority church schools and that they can continue to operate.  This is an arrangement that was entered into at the time of the merger.  The 32 reserved places represent fewer than 5% of total places in initial teacher education.  The measure ensures that these schools, which probably represent about 5% of schools, have a flow of teachers who are committed to teaching with that ethos.  It works as a reservation, so the Central Applications Office, CAO, system will still apply, but the places will be treated as though they were on another course.<\/p> <p>  A limited number of people, perhaps 70 to 100 over the years, have applied for this number of places.

In the written script sent by the Minister, which the committee members received in an email this morning, he acknowledged that the place of religion in education is changing.  We all understand that there is a lot of fluidity around this issue at the moment.  Views similar to those Senator Gavan has just expressed are growing in this country.  In this case, however, I certainly understand the background to it.  The merger of the colleges was a significant move at the time, and it is important that we have that kind of integration.  In some ways it is historic that colleges like St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education are coming together in a secular university to train teachers in initial education.

I ask because there are a number of different minority beliefs out there and there may be more in the future.

They are treated as another course.  If a lot of people apply for them, there could be a high threshold.  There is a competition for this particular segment.  It may have historically been somewhat lower.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the issue of how the State supports schools of different diverse natures, Ireland is unique in that in primary education we have just ten State schools run by the education and training boards, ETBs.  More than 3,100 are private institutions, run by either Educate Together, of which An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta is the patron, or religious denominations.  The State has traditionally supported primary education across a range of patrons.  Where we introduce new schools now, we allow parents to choose which patron should succeed.  We do not say whether it should be a State patron or a non-State patron, but we do seek to ensure that whatever patron succeeds promotes diversity.  The de facto situation is that in the past seven years, which is all I can recall or account for, a primary school has never gone to a patron with a denominational ethos.  They are all going elsewhere.  <\/p> <p>  However, the State has allowed for considerations of ethos, characteristic and spirit.  That is embedded in our legislation.  That brings me to Senator Paul Gavan's point.  To a degree, the provisions in employment legislation follow on from that.  In this case, people who go undertake this programme must demonstrate an understanding of and a willingness to support the distinctive ethos of Protestant primary schools.  Those are the people who are expected to apply for the places.  I know that Sinn F&eacute;in has a view that primary schools should be a State provision rather than something provided through private or distinctive institutions of different types.  However, the approach in employment law reflects our general approach to educational diversity, rather than trying to be discriminatory.  I suspect that trying to change that would be a bit like the ivy root, as they say.  We would pull one piece thinking it is distinctive, and then all the rest would follow.  I do not know of any proposals to change the provisions to which the Senator refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#B00900","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the response.

Education is a very fluid and changing environment.  Deputy Paul Murphy is correct that an education system being designed today would not be 95% composed of denominational schools.  The question is whether such system would have no denominational schools, which the Deputy puts forward as the optimum situation.  The wishes of parents must be taken into account in this matter.  Parents are the primary educators.  It is a strength of society that people wish to bring up their children in their ethos and faith.  However, that must not make others feel small or not valued, etc.  There is undoubtedly an imbalance in our education system.  We are trying to change the system to reflect the changing Ireland without losing some of its strengths.  The transfer of schools from religious to non-religious patrons must occur far more quickly.  That is urgently needed and I have recently initiated a new approach to try to drive it forward.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy also raised the issue of whether ethos should be taken out of other areas, specifically relationship and sexuality education.  Again, there are different views on that matter.  Come what may, the proper, factual educational content must be delivered to every student, regardless of school ethos.  In light of the concerns of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and our inspectorate, we initiated a timely review of the delivery of relationship and sexuality education.  The law has changed, as have many other matters.  Deputy Paul Murphy brought forward the Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018, which has passed First Stage.  As I stated on Second Stage of the Bill, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, must undertake a broad consultation on the curriculum in order to gather expert views on the content of programmes and how they are delivered.  Although I acknowledge the principle behind the legislation, stipulating curriculum content in primary legislation such that curricular evolution would require amendment of that legislation would probably not be ideal.  However, we must get the view of the NCCA on this matter and allow education stakeholders an input into the discussion in order to be able to make decisions based on the best expertise because it is vital that we get this right.  The NCCA is proceeding with all possible haste in that regard.  It realises the urgency the Oireachtas attaches to the issue but it will do a thorough job.  We have a robust system for the development of curricular change.  It is an evolving space and we must consider how to ensure that religious ethos does not prevent proper progress.  That is a challenge which we must meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#C01500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughton and I were members of the all-party Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.

Many of our school mission statements cite development of the whole person as their central aim.  Education, however, cannot be deemed to be holistic in any sense if it ignores either our actions or the spiritual or moral basis of the values that inform such actions.  Schools must therefore engage fully with parents in the development of high-quality programmes of relationships and sexuality education congruent with the characteristic spirit of the school and setting out to educate, in the truest sense, the values, understandings and actions of the generation of young people in their care.<br\/><br\/>The position of Catholic schools in regard to sex education was outlined in a church document, <i>Familiaris Consortio, <\/i>which states: &quot;Sex education, which is a basic right and duty of parents, must also be carried out under their attentive guidance, whether at home or in educational centres chosen by them.&quot;  At our annual conference in May of this year, Archbishop Eamon Martin said: &quot;Relationships and Sexuality Education ought to be an integral part of the curriculum in a Catholic school ... [but] should not be reduced to the imparting of so-called 'objective' information, dissociated from a morals and values framework or from the totality of relationships.&quot;<\/p><p>Archbishop Martin further stated: \"I agree that a review of relationships and sexuality education in all schools, including our Catholic schools, is essential if we are to help young people cope with the risks to their health and well-being presented in both the virtual and real worlds they inhabit\".  Setting the scene for the delivery of RSE at local level requires the establishment of a school policy which clearly articulates the context and content of the programme and engages, in particular, with the parent perspective.  Informing what transacts within the RSE classroom equally demands a high level of engagement between teaching staff, school leadership and the support services.<\/p><p> To this end, the Joint Managerial Body, Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, JMB AMCSS, as an organisation, and JMB schools on an individual basis, have been closely associated with the development, consultation and piloting of both the SPHE, incorporating RSE curriculum at junior cycle, and the senior cycle RSE programme and materials.  It is nonetheless incumbent upon school management at local level to ensure that such programmes are compatible with the school&rsquo;s ethos and that parents have had their right to consultation respected, as well as their right to withdraw their child from RSE classes.<\/p><p> There remains, however, an ongoing challenge in this area which can only be remediated by high quality in-service and ongoing professional support for teachers.  A reduction in the professional support service for teachers in RSE in recent years represents an opportunity for policymakers to engage with both HSE and the Department of Education and Skills, DES, in maintaining such support across the system.  The provision of social personal and health education classes across junior cycle is not an option for schools and should be universal.  The RSE element of the SPHE curriculum is similarly prescribed from first to third year, with the caveat of an opt-out for parents, but challenges to provision include the availability of teachers trained and willing to teach this<\/p><p>element.  As a matter of priority, and in advance of any medium-term review, DES should invest in a new round of training opportunities for teachers to maintain and increase the pool of such educators available for scheduling into RSE classes.<\/p><p> In short, we need to adequately train and professionally develop RSE teachers in their own right &ndash; developing expertise in every aspect of both the course materials and the likely questions necessarily arising in the classroom setting.  The development of a postgraduate diploma course in SPHE-RSE is particularly to be recommended.<\/p><p> The policy of age appropriateness has always formed a central pillar of provision of RSE education in schools, particularly as it relates to the question of sexual consent.  The concept could, however, be widened to incorporate conceptual appropriateness in that students with special educational needs or English language deficit or those at particular ends of the maturity scale should be provided with a differentiated model of teaching and engagement with this critical subject area.  Local school management is best placed to identify such needs but yet again, such nuanced practice will demand high-calibre teacher professional development and school leadership awareness.<\/p><p> These are critical elements in a young person&rsquo;s education which demand higher than usual levels of school-family mutual awareness and at least some level of genuine partnership in achieving the holistic goals of the educational enterprise.  RSE, in all its forms, represents such an imperative.  Parents and guardians need face-to-face contact with the school on this matter.  Beginning with general information sessions and offering individualised meetings with school personnel where required, represent a basic level of engagement.  The development of an RSE policy must also involve the parent representative body in the school as well as the staff, student council, board of management and trustees.  The relationship between home and school on this issue must be a trusting one, and this can only be developed by maintaining high levels of awareness and communication.<\/p><p> This is equally true of the relationship between outside agencies and school communities.  School management is charged with the duty of ensuring everything that happens in the school community aligns with its ethos.  Specific areas such as religious education, faith formation, pastoral care and relationships and sexuality education, necessarily demand greater levels of alertness in this respect than, for example, many of the other subjects on the curriculum.  Building up high levels of trust between external agencies and school management should therefore represent a priority for all.  <\/p><p> JMB is aware that the Minister has written to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to seek a professional review of the landscape of RSE provision in our schools.  JMB is encouraged by the scope of this work which will include: how the RSE curriculum is planned, is taught and how parents are involved; the entire curriculum is being taught in schools to a high standard; the role of the classroom teacher in teaching the curriculum and the appropriate levels of supports which are currently being provided by external providers; what time is given to it, what resources are being provided, and what support materials are being used; and how effective is the continuing professional development opportunities which are currently provided by the Department and other bodies to RSE teachers.<\/p><p> JMB will, of course, engage fully with this process and looks forward, in particular, to the subsequent investment of new ideas, energy and resources into this most important of educational enterprises.

As mentioned in our submission, we welcome the opportunity to engage and collaborate.<\/p> <p>  For the purposes of the presentation, I wish to outline the underlying characteristic spirit of the schools under ETB patronage that informs our delivery of the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, in our curriculum and the role of the boards of management of our schools in its development.  Each ETB, as the patron, appoints a board of management to manage the particular school or college.<\/p> <p>  I would like to highlight the functions of the school as outlined under section 9(d) of the Education Act 1998, which defines the functions of a school as to \"promote the moral, spiritual, social, and personal development of students and provide health education for them, in consultation with their parents, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school.\"  I believe this is a key point.<\/p> <p>  ETBs are statutory education authorities with our own corporate identity.  They manage and operate community national schools, some second-level provision, education and training centres as well as a plethora of adult education and training programmes.  While an ETB is the body corporate for all schools, colleges and centres established and maintained under our patronage, ETBs delegate many management functions and responsibilities to its boards of management.<\/p> <p>  The characteristic spirit and core values of ETBs are important.  Our schools are State, multi-denominational schools.  This has a significant impact on the core values and characteristic spirit of our sector.  At primary level, with the ETB as patron, the core values of our community national schools, CNSs, are: excellence in education; multi-denominational; equality-based; and community focused.  All members of our CNS boards of management receive extensive training to enable them to participate fully in their role as board of management members and to promote the core values of the schools.<\/p> <p>  There is currently a significant piece of work being carried out across ETBs at post-primary schools, and this is to enable us to clearly articulate our core values and characteristic spirits.  Although this work is ongoing, we can say with confidence that all of our schools are committed to equal respect for all of our students, regardless of their faith or belief, nationality or other aspect of their identity.  Our approach to the curriculum is influenced by this.<\/p> <p>  Our approach to RSE is not through any particular religious or belief lens.  Therefore, RSE is embedded in social, personal and health education in the curriculum at all levels.  The content of the RSE programme is delivered in an objective and critical manner that avoids any particular religious bias.  In line with our core values and characteristic spirit, we believe that all children and young people have a right to a high quality, holistic and inclusive RSE.  The ETB position, as communicated to the boards of management of our schools, is that RSE is about relationships, emotions and well-being.  This has been central to our roll-out of well-being within the context of the new junior cycle.  This holistic approach considers not only the sexual health of young people, but does so by informing them in a holistic, balanced and factual way.<\/p> <p> ETBs also have designated schools under its remit.  They manage these community colleges under what we call a model agreement.  This is an ETB school where the management of the school is governed by a specific agreement between the ETB - formerly the VEC - and a co-trustee, possibly the local diocese or a religious congregation or other recognised school patron.<\/p><p>The model agreement refers to the agreement between the ETB and the co-trustee &ndash; an agreement that as well as giving the co-trustee a role in the management of the school, gives the co-trustee a role in determining the school&rsquo;s characteristic spirit.  This is consistent with the Education Act 1998.<br\/><br\/>While designated model agreement colleges have a co-trustee, the ETB is the patron.  In regard to this type of designate school, that is, a community college, the characteristic spirit can have some impact in terms of the methods chosen to deliver aspects of the RSE programme.  It may also have a bearing on what resources are chosen to assist delivery.  However, designated schools do not cherry-pick or omit aspects of the RSE programme.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>It is important that the board of management within non-designated schools communicate and consult with the key stakeholders about the RSE policy.  They include students, parents, teachers, school management and, in the case of community colleges, the co-trustee.  These stakeholders have much to contribute to ensuring a successful and highly effective RSE programme is implemented in a school.  The characteristic spirit of a school should not preclude children and young people in any way from acquiring the key messages within an RSE programme.<br\/><br\/>An extensive training programme to board of management members has been delivered by a cascade model through the ETBI structures.  This is to help members to carry out their role within the boards of management effectively.  It is useful to highlight that the quality assurance aspect of the RSE programme is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills, through its inspectorate.  Quality assurance is possibly through subject inspection.  In this regard, I refer to SPHE.  There is a robust process.  It is also addressed within the management, leadership and learning aspect of the whole-school evaluation.  The board of management is central to this inspection.<br\/><br\/>The review of RSE by the committee is welcomed by ETBI.  We very much look forward to seeing the deliberations and findings positively influencing the outcomes of the overall review process.  It is important to ensure the review of the RSE curriculum will identify the changes necessary to meet the needs of young people in a very much changing Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martin Gormley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>I thank both delegates for their presentations.

When first reading the material, I noted morality was mentioned many times.  Maybe it is the philosophy student in me.  The word \"morality\" just kept jumping out at me.  Morality can be relative.  Who exactly sets out the moral indicators for children in terms of what is and is not acceptable, especially regarding sex education and every type of relationship, including transgender relationships.  Who exactly is responsible?  What does morality mean in each of the statements?  In the resource materials for fifth and sixth classes, morality is also mentioned.  The word \"morality\" is used a lot, in addition to the word \"values\".  Deputy Naughton asked about what is not taught, as did Deputy Byrne.  Are the delegates aware of the Catholic Church interfering with the sexual education of kids, regardless of the RSE programme?  I refer to when the church becomes aware that particular schools are bringing in external providers or teaching about sexual consent and positive sexual experiences.  I am aware of a number of cases of an individual - I think it might have been a bishop - sending letters to schools to stop what they are teaching regarding sexual consent.  I suppose it makes the schools somewhat fearful because of their boards of management.  How do the delegates feel about that?  I am reading the quotes from Archbishop Martin.  He used the phrase, \"the imparting of so-called 'objective' information\".  I believe I am right in saying the Catholic Church has been imparting so-called objective information.  Sexual education is much more factual when we move to a new age and away from the Catholic values associated with sexuality.  I notice phrases such as \"essential if we are to help young people cope with the risks to their health\".  Sometimes when it comes to the Catholic Church and sexual education, the statements are risk-associated.  It is about the risks to one's life and health, the risk of becoming pregnant outside marriage and the risk of STIs.  The approach is all risk-oriented rather than about teaching sexual education in a positive framework around negotiated sexual experiences, what is acceptable, why experiences should be positive and why one should be confident in certain circumstances.  My main question is on who sets out the idea of morality in each school.  Second, how do the delegates feel about the Catholic Church sending letters to school to stop them from carrying out sexual consent workshops?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#F00600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1405,"content":"<p>Some of those views are possibly not unique to the Catholic Church.

Almost three quarters of students found their experience of sex education to be at least extremely unsatisfactory.  Some 87% of students surveyed found that LGBTQ+ relationships were not discussed sufficiently.  Some 25% or so said contraception was not mentioned at all.<\/p><p>Mr. Curtis referred to the document <i>Familiaris consortio<\/i>as informing how schools with a Catholic ethos would deliver relationships and sexuality education.  Does he agree with the views set out which I will quote and does he think they should inform how sex education is delivered?  It states:<\/p><blockquote>In this context education for chastity is absolutely essential, for it is a virtue that develops a person's authentic maturity and makes him or her capable of respecting and fostering the &quot;nuptial meaning&quot; of the body.  Indeed Christian parents, discerning the signs of God's call, will devote special attention and care to education in virginity or celibacy as the supreme form of that self-giving that constitutes the very meaning of human sexuality ... For this reason the Church is firmly opposed to an often widespread form of imparting sex information dissociated from moral principles.  That would merely be an introduction to the experience of pleasure and a stimulus leading to the loss of serenity - while still in the years of innocence - by opening the way to vice.<\/blockquote> <p>Does that inform how sex education is delivered in schools with a Catholic ethos?  If we had a curriculum which was, in the view of the bishop, supposedly objective and not informed by a religious ethos, would the schools under the delegates' management, in their opinion, have the legal right not to deliver some of that curriculum if it was found to go against the ethos set out in, for example, <i>Familiaris consortio<\/i>?<\/p><p>The final question is for Dr. Gormley.  Atheist Ireland has carried out some research, while we have raised some of these cases in the D&aacute;il with reference to education and training board, ETB, schools, for example, in County Tipperary which state they have a Roman Catholic ethos.  How can the ETB ensure the professed Roman Catholic ethos does not interfere with the delivery of objective sex education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#G00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1409,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  With Deputies Hildegarde Naughton and Jan O'Sullivan and Senator Lynn Ruane, I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, of which a key ancillary recommendation concerned the need for a consistent programme of sex education, regardless of school ethos.  I do not see how that can sit within the remit of schools that come under the Joint Managerial Body, JMB.  I say that respectfully, but the last questioner made it very clear why that was the case.  Even the language used in <i>Familiaris consortio<\/i>sounds like something from another century which I guess it is at this stage.  Is Mr. Curtis saying the JMB cannot agree with the idea of having an objective, consistent programme of relationships and sexuality education, regardless of school ethos?<\/p><p>With regard to Dr. Gormley's presentation, I have a concern about the model agreement college, whereby it is tied with a trustee partner such as the local diocese or religious congregation.  That surely has to have a impact locally on how the issue is dealt with.  Sinn F&eacute;in is very clear that it is a republican party.  It believes in the complete separation of church and State.  It also believes education in this area should be consistent.  It does not think it should be watered down or changed because of ethos.  Fundamentally, we are dealing with a problem in how the education system grew.  It should be democratic and under the control of the State, but it is not.

I am a fan of the home-school liaison system.  It is a good one.  The link between parents and teachers in school is important in the provision of RSE.  Do the delegates believe home-school liaison officers could be an appropriate link?  They would, however, need extra support through training, etc.  That question is particularly for Mr. Curtis.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Gormley talked about the characteristic spirit of ETB schools.  The ETB's post-primary section is carrying out work to establish what are the schools' core values and characteristic spirit, another word for \"ethos\" to a certain extent.  When do the delegates expect this body of work to be completed?  Is it something that could inform the process?  \"Ethos\" can sometimes be a loose term.  Is it the delegates' opinion that it can sometimes be used as an excuse to avoid implementation of an effective RSE programme in schools?  Something that has come up in our stakeholder meetings is that the delivery of RSE in schools has not been monitored through whole-school evaluations and inspections.  There is a sense that what is measured is monitored.  Therefore, if RSE became part of whole-school evaluations, we might have better implementation.<\/p> <p>  On the guidelines issued by the Department for developing, monitoring and implementing an RSE policy in schools, there is a list of protocols.  A public meeting has to be held to be attended by parents and representatives are nominated to participate in an RSE and a social, personal and health education, SPHE, committee, with the principal and other staff members, etc.  They will have the opportunity to develop a set of guidelines, but that process does not seem to be happening or adhered to.  Do the delegates have views on why that is the case?<\/p> <p>  What is the delegates' opinion on what should happen at departmental level to ensure effective implementation of the RSE policy that will I hope be developed both from the recommendations of this committee and the review the Minister is undertaking?

We are very strong on that point, that that has to be the case.  Ultimately, our schools are Catholic and, as such, have a right to determine that their ethos will have a say in how they are administered and governed and how programmes take place.<\/p><p>We are also very conscious that parental choice is very significant here and there would have to be consultation on the development of any RSE programme and how it would be delivered in schools.  Any sound relationships and sexual education, RSE, programme must engage in all issues such as contraception and LGBT.  As a management body, we work with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, on LGBT issues to ensure that school pupils are looked after and supported there.  All aspects of humanity must be examined and dealt with.  At the same time, we are Catholic schools, that is how we differ from the schools Dr. Gormley represents, and we are cognisant of that.  We are keen to ensure our children are prepared for the challenges they will face as they embark out in life and that there is some moral framework or compass provided to assist them in that.  That is very important.  <\/p><p> A key point is that the issue of consent in relationships has come front and centre in this course in Ireland in recent years.  Perhaps we have not looked at that as closely as we should have on what consent is and how relationships should develop.  That should be to the fore of any programme being examined, remodelled and re-evaluated.  There are caricatures of what Catholic schools are which do not reflect the reality.  We are diverse and inclusive.  We have to be discursive; in this day we cannot teach teenagers, which is what we do, without being discursive and open.  I take the point that has been made about some of the student surveys which point to some difficulties that we have.  We will engage with those through the RSE consultation process.  I note that in 2010 when Comhairle na n&Oacute;g had a survey on this issue, that the Department reissued some guidelines to schools on RSE to which schools adhere.  It is very important that we listen to the student voice.  We need to learn.  <\/p><p> I was starting off as a principal when the RSE programme began.  We invested a lot of time and energy into discussions at local level with our parents, into liaising with the Department and management bodies as to how the programme would roll out.  A lot of resources were put into it supporting those who might speak on RSE in schools or teach on that subject.  Over time, perhaps because of cutbacks, we might have taken our eyes of the ball.

I imagine in the context of some of the negative feedback we have had from student groups on this I would be surprised if there was a difference between denominational or non-denominational schools.  We live in a dialectic age and one cannot sterilise information.  If one is talking to teenagers, of course all facts must be presented to them.  Obviously, in our Catholic schools we want to have some moral framework or compass to help guide our children through the challenges they have, and I return to the consent and relationships.  Perhaps we have not spoken enough on issues such as relationships and have taken our eye off the ball.  Currently, the big issue we are confronted with arises from the digital age and what information is out there for children.  The huge issue in RSE and all it entails is what is age-appropriate.  When it was first constituted, one thing RSE looked at very closely was the age-appropriateness of information.  The goalposts have changed immeasurably on this and we need to re-examine it.<\/p> <p>  I am dealing with a broad range of questions here.  We are absolutely committed to a review of the process and aware that all information must be given to children and students in schools.  We are very committed that, as Catholic schools, we try to provide a moral framework, and must be cognisant of parents' views on the subject.  As someone who is not long out of working in a school, and being a practising principal, I know that parents are very vocal in schools and have a very strong voice.  Perhaps, through this process, their voice will be louder.  We need to engage.  The Chair issued a press release around today's proceedings which noted that this is not an issue that should be left to schools.  Schools are not a panacea for all society's ills.  There ought to be an awareness-raising exercise on this.  In discussion such as this, we may disagree on some aspects but I think we all want to educate our children on the difficulties out there, the difficulties around relationships and those that they face in the digital age.  As an educator, we are somewhat like rabbits caught in the headlights because of the speed of change.  I do not think that we have caught up sufficiently.  We will engage in any process that the Minister puts in place on RSE and we are fully committed to that.  Obviously, we have a Catholic perspective but we have always been strong on the private public partnership and what that entails for our schools.  We have always worked very closely with the Department to ensure the delivery of what it determines in the curriculum and will continue to do so.  <\/p> <p>  There is an issue of resources and training for teachers.  A principal might not have people jumping up and down to teach RSE classes.  It can be difficult to get people to engage with it because of its complexities; it is not a simple subject for teachers to go into.  We need to upskill teachers and encourage them.  We should look at the positives of what is involved and of relationships and why we need to talk about these things.  Work must be done on teacher training and the Department can help by providing resources.  Perhaps a diploma programme could be established to give people the confidence to engage in these very complex issues.  I would reiterate a point which is fundamental, namely that children must be given all information.  We have to discuss matters such as contraception and those related to LGBT.  We are all aware of that and do it as best as we can but we must be cognisant that schools have their ethos.  As Catholic schools, we have a strong belief in providing a framework to equip  children for challenges they face now and in the future.  It must be done in a dialectic way involving communication.  There will be disagreement and we will be challenged.  We are dealing with teenagers, it is their job to challenge us, give out and criticise.  That is what happens in schools.  We cannot go into schools, not deal with things, and expect our students and parents to be happy with that.  That does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I welcome that Mr. Curtis stated there is no area of the RSE programme that the JMB is unwilling to have taught in its schools.

The point we are making is that parents are the prime educators in this sphere.  That is what we are attending to.  In the context of anything that emerges obviously we need to talk to the parents at local level.  We represent Catholic schools.  Parents send their children to Catholic schools.  We are cognisant of that and we deal with those parents.  We are trying to educate children to deal with the difficulties they will face in this world, based on some moral framework that gives them some moral compass as they move through.  Where we might differ in the context of our opinions is that we do not believe it is possible to have purely objective information; everything in some respect is values based.<\/p> <p>  I recently came across a circular issued by the Department in 2010 further to the deliberations of the National Youth Council at the time.  The point it made was that schools needed to properly engage with the RSE programme.  It also made the point that programmes based on information alone are very limited in the learning outcomes they can achieve and can, in fact, be counterproductive in influencing values, attitudes and behaviour.  We are encouraging issues to be dealt with in a discursive manner and students can talk about issues and can be presented with the challenges or the promise of a Catholic framework.  Obviously children and their parents have to engage with that.  If parents do not want their children to be part of an RSE programme, they have the capacity to withdraw their children from it.<\/p> <p>  It is a complex issue.  I contend that we have been dealing with it at school level very productively.  It is important that we review the issue because obviously, as I said, we have differing views in the sector.  I firmly believe there needs to be a focus on talking, on the dialectic and on engaging with the students.  The crucial aspect is that we talk about everything and put the focus on the \"R\" in RSE.  Relationships are more and more important in the context of the issues we are dealing with in schools today.  Children can be in very lonely places now because we are in the digital age and because of smartphones.  The capacity to engage that was part and parcel of our generation is no longer there to the same extent, with all the attendant mental health issues that might accrue from that.

We need to recognise that parents are the prime educators.  We need to respect the views of parents as well as the student voice in terms of compulsion.<\/p> <p>  On the main challenges for teachers, we are living in a very different Ireland now.  The children and young people who sit in front of teachers today have considerable exposure to the Internet, social media, etc., and this presents serious challenges for teachers.  Importantly when teachers are delivering RSE, taking due respect of the characteristic spirit of the school, they must be inclusive and respectful with an emphasis on well-being and trust.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Naughton also asked about training.  We used to have a specific group of teachers who are what we would call SPHE teachers.  This is very much changing in schools now with the introduction of the new junior cycle and the whole emphasis on well-being.  The junior cycle training under the directorship of Dr. P&aacute;draig Kirk is very much based on a whole-school approach.  When there is training on well-being, all the teachers in a school attend.  If we are to move forward as educators that is the emphasis we need to have in our schools.  It is not just selected teachers who are delivering on SPHE and RSE ultimately.  There has to be a whole-school approach.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne, who is now in the Chair, asked about an ETB school as a non-designated school and a community school.  There is a difference there.  We have ETB schools, community colleges and community schools.  Community schools come under the remit of the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, AMCSS.  A community college is a school whereby the ETB and a co-trustee go together.  The ETB is the patron.

The role of the inspectorate is to ensure that the curriculum is being rolled out as stipulated.<\/p> <p>  On the question from Senator Gallagher, boards of management are challenging in terms of the role they have to play for their members.  Capacity is one thing in terms of ensuring that we have the right expertise around the table.  We are fortunate in ETB schools in that we have ETB nominees.  We also have staff nominees and parental nominees.  That forms the board of management in ETB schools.  An extensive training programme has been implemented by ETBI through a cascade model where each ETB is responsible for the training of the members of the boards of management.  We do recognise the role ETB boards of management play.  It is a very comprehensive role and a lot arrives on the tables of boards of management, for example, matters under section 29 on suspensions and expulsions, inspection reports, meetings with the inspectorate and school policy among other areas.  Extensive training is required.  We have been fortunate in that we try to identify expertise from an ETB point of view and then we have our staff nominees and parental nominees.<\/p> <p>  Senator Gallagher also referred to the workload of principals.  We recognise that the role of the principal is an increasingly difficult and challenging one within the current educational space.  For example, over the past year we have had a number of new initiatives and new items that have come onto the desks of principals.  There is the general data protection regulation, GDPR, the new childcare arrangements in that regard, the posts of responsibility and the reviews in that regard, and the implementation of the new junior cycle.  They are just some of the things as well as trying to run a school on a day-to-day basis.  The role of the principal is a very challenging one.  That has been communicated to the Department through ETBI.  We recognise that workload.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane talked about morality.  It is important that core values are clearly identified.  We are doing a lot of work around that with the post-primary sector.  The reason that has been highlighted and has come on the agenda is in terms of school patronage, and it is very important.  Another issue is the changing Ireland we are now in.  We have seen that in recent times with the various amendments that have been voted upon and agreed and they influence our school.  Core values are very important.  In the RSE programme things that need to be central include consent, contraception, sexual expression in relationship, safe use of the Internet, social media and LGBTQ+.  The important thing from an ETBI point of view is that it is delivered in a holistic, balanced and factual way.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy referred to the recent survey from the students' union on the delivery of RSE within the curriculum and the lack of satisfaction a number of students expressed in regard to it.  His question was whether we are aware of that.  The Department of Education and Skills is the body charged with ensuring implementation.  It consults by means of a whole-school evaluation, WSE, with both parents and students.  What is delivered back to us is that there has not been a huge amount of negativity expressed towards us, but I accept that we are trying to deliver to second level students who have so much access to the Internet and to social media and are coming in with some views they have formed from external sources.  There is a challenge in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see an increased emphasis on SPHE and RSE being central to the Department of Education and Skills inspections.  The student voice is so important.  We now see that as very much part of the implementation of the new junior cycle.  There is an increased emphasis on listening to students within schools, and rightly so.<\/p> <p>  Senator Gavan talked about the model agreement in terms of the characteristic spirit.  The characteristic spirit of a non-designated ETB school is quite clear in terms of being multidenominational, inclusive, respectful and concerned about well-being.  In terms of a designated school, a community college, the fact that there is a co-trustee influences the characteristic spirit of the model.  That was why the model agreements were set up at the time.  One is respectful of the characteristic spirit of both the patron and co-trustee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martin Gormley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1451,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Gormley maintaining that what is taught in RSE is exactly the same as what is taught in an ETB school?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Vice Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>Yes, the context should be exactly the same.

Dr. Gormley can say the content as delivered is the same but then he says different materials and different methods are used, which gives rise to the question of whether what the student is taught in the classroom is any different.  It would seem to me that it is likely that it is.  It is a Jesuitical distinction between the content and the method of delivery.  To give an example, in Coachford College in Cork, I presume there is an ETB co-trustee and it has an RSE policy which says the human body is sacred and that marriage is the natural context in which the self giving love in its entirety is possible in co-operation with God and bringing new human life into the world.  That is its policy.

He described the parent as being the primary educator and then he talked about that within the context of the moral and values framework of the ethos of the school.<\/p><p>I do not know if there is any research on this but in some cases parents have no choice but to send their children to a school of a particular ethos because of where they live.  In many other cases, parents make the decision to send their children to the local school.  I live in an area with two local schools, one of which is a Catholic boys' school, a diocesan college, and the other a Catholic girls' school run under one of the religious orders.  If people are making the choice to send their child to the local school and consider that to be more important than anything else, there must be a lot of parents in Catholic ethos schools who want something much more inclusive in the RSE curriculum than is contained in the Catholic ethos description.  When the delegates say they consult parents, exactly how does that take place?  Do they just assume parents have sent their child to a school because they want a Catholic ethos, for example?  I know that from my own experience.<\/p><p> For Dr. Gormley on the same issue, in respect of co-trustees, what about the rights of the other trustees and the parents of children in the other half of the equation?  Surely they have the right to the ethos they have chosen, which is that they want complete, open, direct information without any judgmental imposition on them.

In his opening statement, Mr. Curtis said that the position of the Catholic schools on sex education was outlined in this document.  Does he agree that RSE in Catholic schools should be taught in the context of that document's statement that \"in this context, education for chastity is absolutely essential\"?  Does he agree that this should inform the teaching of RSE in Catholic schools today?  Does he agree that the imparting of \"sex information dissociated from moral principles ... would ... be an introduction to the experience of pleasure and a stimulus leading to the loss of serenity ... by opening the way to vice\"?<\/p> <p>  There can be lots of reasons for teachers to be uncomfortable teaching RSE.  One of the reasons cited by teachers is a sense that because of the characteristic spirit of the school, they can walk into difficult territory and that by answering certain questions or giving certain information they can contravene the characteristic spirit of the school.  Do Mr. Curtis and Dr. Gormley agree?<\/p> <p>  The last comments by Dr. Gormley get to the point of Senator Ruane's question.  Section 9(d) of the Education Act, 1998, provides that a recognised school shall use its available resources to \"promote the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students, and provide health education for them, in consultation with their parents, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school.\"  That is key.  Does Mr. Curtis agree that it gives a legal right to Catholic schools to mediate - which is the word he has used - the content of the curriculum in respect of RSE?

What we seem to be saying is that the resources or the materials may be different.

In practical terms, we are not that far apart because information is being disseminated according to the RSE guidelines determined by the Department.  Schools will have a separate frame.  I know the point he is making.  We will engage with the RSE review and see what emerges from the consultation but we will also advance the position that in our schools there is a Catholic frame and a set of Catholic values and attitudes that need to be advanced and given to children.  There is a dialectic space after that whereby dialogue will be engaged in and people will speak.<br\/><br\/>I am more concerned about the issue Deputy O'Sullivan raised about parental engagement.  We had an awful lot of parental engagement on RSE when the programme emerged in the first instance.  Many meetings were held at school level and that created an awareness around it.  There was a lot of discussion.  That has not occurred recently in as serious a space.  There is ongoing consultation with parents at school level in respect of RSE programmes because we have student council meetings.  I imagine that as part of this process there will be engagement with parents on a more fundamental level than might hitherto have been the case.<br\/><br\/>I take the point that we advance a Catholic frame and try to educate the children to have some kind of a moral compass <i>apropos<\/i>of how they engage.  It is hugely important that we get our teachers to engage and that they want to teach in this space.  Perhaps there can be a reluctance because it is a complex area.  It is a complex area for all of us - for the members and for us.  The conversation we are engaging in now will be useful in this sphere.<br\/><br\/>I take the Vice Chairman's point that there is not that fundamental a difference between us.  We have characteristic spirit in our schools.  It is enshrined in the Act and is the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of our schools.  However, we operate in partnership with the State, as we always have and always will.  We will engage in dialogue with the State on this as on all issues to ensure that partnership can go forward as well.  The characteristic spirit is key and crucial to our schools.  It is how we fundamentally operate and we would like to think that our Catholic schools are a good example of how a private-public partnership can work.<br\/><br\/>I will come back to what concerns us at school level, namely, the changing nature of technology, the digital age and the challenges that students are facing on the ground.  In the context of proportionality, I would like to go back to the &quot;R&quot; in RSE.  Perhaps even in today's debate we are focusing too much on one aspect of this.  It is a matter of how children engage with each other, how to get them talking to each other, how to deal with issues around mobile phones, etc., and how we engage parents in a broader conversation.  That is useful.<br\/><br\/>A lot of the activity around the review of RSE resulted from the Belfast case and issues around consent and relationships.  That led to forthright and frank conversations around kitchen tables in all households in the country.  That is hugely educative for us and perhaps we can use this debate in a broad sense as a springboard to ask parents to engage more.  Schools cannot do everything.  I take the point Senator Ruane made.  We ask so much of our schools now.  These are complex spaces and we are overloaded.  Of course we will engage with this as best we can.<\/p><p>We are cognisant of the fact that our principals can only do so much.  We need resources from the Department in the context of RSE as well.  We need programmes whereby our teachers can feel confident in teaching the RSE programme and we need resources in that space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018070500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Curtis","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1483,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Paul Murphy and Senator Ruane, in terms of characteristic spirit and that, the first thing in respect of Education and Training Boards Ireland is that the large majority of our schools are ETB schools and non-designated.

It is important that parents are consulted on how RSE is delivered and the space within which it exists.  The primary school RSE curriculum was introduced in 1999 and the post-primary curriculum came in in 2000.  Each board of management has an RSE policy on which parents and students are consulted.  It is a stakeholders' policy.  We often refer to parents as partners in education.  Increasingly, students are also being recognised in respect of the contribution they can make as a student voice, which is also important.  In terms of characteristic spirit, then, should RSE be devoid of it completely?

Our teams offer assistance to people based solely on need, irrespective of religion, gender or political affiliation, and our actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of neutrality and impartiality.  Simply put, we go where we are needed, regardless of who and where our patients may be.<\/p> <p>  To put this into perspective, we currently have around 40,000 staff working in more than 70 countries worldwide.  Importantly, more than 95% of our funding comes from private individuals, including some in Ireland, which means we are financially independent from state power, religious groups and multilateral organisations.<\/p><p>As has been seen in this committee previously, Irish medical staff are providing life-saving care to communities caught up in some of the world's most severe humanitarian crises.  The Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen are just a few of the places where field workers from Ireland are working.<br\/><br\/>MSF also provides medical care to refugees, migrants and asylum seekers around the world.  Wars, persecution, conflict and poverty are pushing record numbers of people from their homes.  The United Nations estimates there are 68.5 million displaced people worldwide and today, with 85% of displaced people hosted in developing countries, looking after people on the move is a necessity worldwide and not something that is only relevant in Europe.<br\/><br\/>We appear before the committee today following what was the deadliest seven-day period so far this year, during which at least 200 people lost their lives, 170 of whom died since last Friday when European leaders agreed to blame search and rescue missions and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and obstruct their work.  This is a critical time for people embarking on these crossings but NGO search and rescue is being blocked and demonised by European governments.<br\/><br\/>We commend the Taoiseach's offer to welcome 25 vulnerable people from the humanitarian search and rescue ship, <i>MV Lifeline,<\/i>which was turned away from a number of European ports last week.  It is a truly humanitarian gesture which sends out a positive message when Europe is in dire need of such acts of solidarity and compassion.  Speaking at the conclusion of the EU summit last Friday, An Taoiseach quite rightly made the comment that this &quot;is not so much a migrant crisis as it is a political crisis.&quot;  Unfortunately, however, he also made some more unhelpful comments about NGOs saving lives at sea, saying that some were not up to much good in the Mediterranean.  These were unfair comments.  NGOs engaged in search and rescue have saved tens of thousands of lives in the past three years.  In Europe it is becoming popular to seek scapegoats, rather than acknowledging Europe's failure to respond to migration in a way in keeping with Europe's stated values of solidarity and humanity.  NGOs have provided the only dedicated search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean as European policies support efforts by the Libyan coast guard to intercept and return people to Libya.  Demonising NGOs or the refugees and migrants they assist will not help this situation.  Search and rescue is a response to, and not the cause of, the crisis.<br\/><br\/>We note that Ireland is using its strong identity as a neutral, humanitarian player on the world stage to pitch for a non-permanent member status on the UN Security Council.  It is important to exercise this same consistency of voice and approach on behalf of the people attempting to flee violence and abuse in Libya, especially in a moment when the politics of populism threatens to take away the human element of the response to migration.  It is crucial that we put the lives of the men, women and children we assist every day at sea above politics.<br\/><br\/>MSF appeared before the committee one year ago, before the decision was made to end the humanitarian Operation Pontus.  The men and women of the Irish Naval Service have shown great professionalism and compassion saving lives as part of Operation Sophia.  It should be noted, however, that a main focus of that mission is to support the Libyan coast guard&rsquo;s efforts to intercept migrant dinghies and boats leaving the shore and return them to Libya, where many face horrific treatment and abuse.  European migration strategy prioritises preventing people from reaching our shores above the lives of people.  The aim is to keep human suffering out of sight and out of mind for the European public.<br\/><br\/>We again thank members for giving us an opportunity to address the committee today.  I hand over to Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, humanitarian affairs adviser on migration with MSF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Taylor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530781200,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>I have spent time in Libya in detention centres for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and on the <i>MV Aquarius<\/i>, the ship which MSF operates with SOS M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e doing search and rescue at sea.  MSF began its search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea in May 2015, after Italy discontinued Operation Mare Nostrum.  At the time, it appeared that Europe was willing to allow people to die at sea in large numbers.  We fear that is the case again today.  Since then, MSF has rescued and assisted more than 76,000 people in peril and provided emergency healthcare to people on board our rescue ships.  Time after time on board, we hear the stories of refugees and migrants who come through Libya.  I would like to share a testimony that our nurse from Ireland collected on the <i>Aquarius<\/i>ten days ago:<\/p><blockquote>When they beat people and they saw the UN was coming, they would hide the beaten people in another room and they said to us: &quot;Don't tell the UN anything that happens here, if you say that, we are going to kill you.&quot;  They will threaten to kill us so nobody would say anything.<\/blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, this is one experience we have heard many times.<br\/><br\/>Last week&rsquo;s European Council conclusions fall short of the humanitarian obligations of Europe.  The only thing European countries seem to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are or the horror they are escaping, and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations.  This is a distraction.  The real issue is that EU member states are putting migrants and refugees in a position where they have a choice between risking their lives at sea or being trapped and abused in Libya.<br\/><br\/>For a summit that was supposed to be the defining moment for the EU, governments appear to have only agreed on the lowest common denominator, hardening their stance on search and rescue and further dehumanising people in need, and turning migrants, refugees and asylum seekers into little more than commodities.  The same governments that were just a few months ago condemning reports of slave markets in Libya seem today to have no hesitation in escalating policies that may increase the suffering of people trapped there, whose only crime is to have fled conflict, violence and poverty.<br\/><br\/>The European Council stated: <\/p><blockquote>[it] will step up its support for the Sahel region, the Libyan Coastguard, coastal and southern communities, humane reception conditions, voluntary humanitarian returns, cooperation with other countries of origin and transit, as well as voluntary resettlement.  All vessels operating in the Mediterranean must respect the applicable laws and not obstruct operations of the Libyan Coastguard. <\/blockquote> <p>It may sound innocuous but make no mistake, behind this wording there is a deliberate policy from EU member states to trap some of the most vulnerable people in Libya.  MSF is directly witnessing the human cost of this policy at sea and in Libya.<br\/><br\/>We all agree that Libya is not a safe place, especially not for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  Whether those who risk their lives at sea in overcrowded and unsafe dinghies are fleeing conflict, persecution or poverty, or are on the move for other reasons, what they all have in common is their experience of Libya, which is marked with physical and sexual violence, torture, forced labour, beatings, exploitation and all forms of abuse.  Most of the people we assist at sea will have spent time in places of detention or in captivity, where they suffer and witness extreme levels of violence.  Under the pretence of saving lives and disrupting the business model of smugglers and traffickers, the Libyan coast guard is supported and empowered by EU states to intercept people at sea and send them back to the very conditions they were seeking to escape.<br\/><br\/>I would like to share another testimony that our colleague from Ireland heard on the <i>Aquarius<\/i>:<\/p><blockquote>When the Libyans caught me in the sea they took me to a place, a deportation camp.  When they took me there was no deporting.  There were so many things happening there.  In the middle of the night they would wake up some ladies to sleep with them.  Some of the women got pregnant in that situation.  They would inject them to take away the pregnancy because the guards didn&rsquo;t want the baby in that place.  They would beat the women and inject them to take away the baby.  One pregnant woman lost her life.  They covered her with black lino.  She had no good treatment, no hot water to clean her womb.  Her baby was bleeding and the baby died.  I stayed there for six months.<\/blockquote> <p>A rescue should conclude with a disembarkation of rescued people in a place of safety.<\/p><p>The Libyan coastguard intercepts people at the behest of European Union member states and forcibly returns them to land.  People will end up back in these situations if they are brought back to Libya.  This is a policy supported by European Governments.<br\/><br\/>The presence at sea of NGOs doing search and rescue is being questioned.  We are seen as being up to no good.  The reality is that at present, no NGO is doing search and rescue at sea.  The four remaining NGOs are either banned and not allowed to operate or face criminal prosecution.  Today the <i>Lifeline<\/i>team is in front of a court in Malta for refusing to hand over to the Libyan coastguard the people it rescued.  They are refusing because they believe that torture is wrong and because international law bans torture and <i>refoulement<\/i>to places of torture.  However, they are the ones in court.<br\/><br\/>People are taken back to extreme levels of abuse in Libya.  The kidnapping of migrants and refugees, holding them captive and using torture to obtain ransom is common.  In one area, Bani Walid, where places of captivity are operated by traffickers, we donate 50 body bags a week, such as the mortality rate of the people held there.  No one fleeing Libya should be intercepted at sea by the Libyan coastguard and forcibly returned.  Libya is not a safe place and we all know this, so when the European Council states we should upgrade or step up our support to the Libyan coastguard, we need to be fully aware of what it means in concrete terms.  People are intercepted in reckless operations by the Libyan coastguard and taken to these places of detention.<br\/><br\/>The European response to addressing the high number of drownings in the Mediterranean Sea is to seal off the coast of Libya and contain refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in a country where they are exposed to extreme and widespread violence and exploitation.  Even if Irish and other European navies are not directly transferring rescued people to the Libyan coastguard, greater numbers of people are being forcibly returned to Libya as a result of European policies with the help of European money.  The fingerprints of European states are everywhere.<br\/><br\/>For almost a year, the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre has been putting our rescue ships on standby as the Libyan coastguard is directed to the scene to intercept those fleeing the country.  The standby can last for up to several hours.  This further endangers vulnerable people.  Saving lives is not a crime.  Destroying search and rescue capacity will lead to more unnecessary deaths at sea and further entrap people.  I want to share the latest figures from this morning.  Since 8 June, when most of the NGOs were squeezed out of the Mediterranean, more than 500 people have drowned or gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Italy, with the total for the year being 1,000.  We are reaching a rate that one in ten people who try to cross the sea might drown or go missing.  It used to be one in 60 people.  We have been told the NGOs are a pull factor and that they are not doing good.  NGOs are not present at sea today and people are dying in numbers we have never seen before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530781200,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hadj-Sahraoui.

He stated, \"We appear before the committee today following what was the deadliest seven-day period so far this year, during which at least 200 people lost their lives\".  To say the least, it is a desperate situation.  Obviously it is getting worse and policies are not having the desired effect we all want to see.

It is extremely difficult and harrowing.  I have met doctors and nurses, most recently Aoife who was on the <i>MS Aquarius<\/i>.  Words fail me with regard to comprehending how they keep going in such difficult circumstances.  It is opportune that the witnesses are here today because yesterday we had post-European Council statements in the D&aacute;il.  One point I made was the word used about the EU approach is &quot;comprehensive&quot;.  We do not hear the word &quot;caring&quot; and we are dealing with extremely vulnerable people.  The other very disturbing point is that while I acknowledge the EU is a major donor for development aid, we also know there will be increases in the European defence budget.  There have to be alarm bells as to where all the money will come from and whether one budget will compete with the other.  We know from what we hear which budget will be most at risk in that scenario.  It is also disturbing when we see the words &quot;migration&quot; and &quot;security&quot; together.  Part of me can understand the political situation in some European countries and the way in which they are trying to find a compromise to prevent the increase in far-right politics but we possibly are going too far bending over to them.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work of the Naval Service and I hope its fine work in the Mediterranean is never compromised.  Smugglers are making money through their disregard for human life.  Are any of them being brought to justice?  Where are the guards in the detention centres from?  Are they Libyan nationals?  Are they forced into being guards?  What is the situation?  I presume it is somewhat lucrative for them.  Perhaps they are also coming out of very difficult situations.<\/p><p>We know that EU states say one of the ways to deal with migration is to tackle the root causes.  I keep asking where do we see this actually happening.  Where are they getting to those root causes with regard to conflict, famine, poverty and the abuse of human rights that cause people to take all of these risks?  What would the witnesses have wanted to have heard from the European Council meeting?  I know we are here to talk about Libya but I ask the witnesses to refer to Yemen because we do not hear very much about the humanitarian crisis there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#D00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530781200,"counter":1509,"content":"<p>I will speak about the situation in Libya, which I have experienced for many years.  We need to contextualise what is happening there to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  There is a breakdown in law and order.  There are weak institutions, if there are any, and they are not necessarily in control.  There are a lot of armed groups, militias and criminal gangs and a lot of the migrants, refugees and asylum seekers fall prey to these groups.  The detention centres are formally under control of the Ministry of the interior, more specifically the department for combatting illegal migration.  The guards are Libyan and only men, and it is a huge issue that we have vulnerable women and girls being detained by men.  However, much of the work is also done by other detainees, depending on whether they speak Arabic.<\/p><p>The conditions in the detention centres are inhumane compared to recommended international standards.  People are held arbitrarily for long periods.  When one visits these detention centres, those held there describe the anguish of not knowing what is going to happen to them, not knowing why they have been captured or why they have been jailed, not knowing how they can get out or if they can get out.<\/p><p> There is also a lucrative business around this.  The best way to get out is to try to bribe one's way out or work one's way out.  When one has been considered to have contributed enough or generated enough income, one can be released.  For some women, it could be that they are forced into prostitution.  In addition to the thousands held in detention centres, there are tens of thousands of people held in the hands of traffickers and smugglers.  These traffickers are reckless and ruthless.  They are now seeing that reaching Europe is increasingly difficult.  Accordingly, the best way to make money is to extort the people.  They hold them for longer periods, torturing them and trying to get as much money as possible from their families and their diasporas abroad.<\/p><p> MSF tries to support survivors of trafficking.  They present with multiple fractures and torture burns.  They are released because the traffickers know they can make no more money from them anymore.  To be accused as a NGO to be colluding with traffickers is extremely hurtful.  We are dealing with the consequences of the treatment of these people by the traffickers.  We are also dealing with young Nigerian girls who we fear are being trafficked for prostitution in Europe.  What we try to do is flag their cases to the authorities and to the UN agencies.  We try to provide awareness on the boat.  We have a system where every woman and girl will have an individual consultation with a nurse or a midwife in order to be able to speak.  We have signs everywhere on the boat that there is a risk of trafficking and there can be a way out.  To be accused of colluding with traffickers is hurtful.  It is certainly incorrect.<\/p><p> Facts seem to no longer matter in the US but also in Europe.  This is why we welcome this opportunity to present to the committee so much.  We must have policies based on facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530781200,"counter":1511,"content":"<p>We would have liked to have heard a humane response with some humane policies from the European Council meeting which treat these issues in a way that takes into consideration the sheer numbers of people involved.

It is a significant issue and we have all seen the horrendous pictures and newsreels of what has happened with migration over the years in the Mediterranean.  However, there are major challenges coming in Europe.  There is a new Government in Italy against migration.  Recently in Germany, the issue nearly brought down Angela Merkel and Britain is leaving the EU.  There is going to be a significant clampdown in Europe on taking in immigrants.  With the population of Africa to double in the next 20 years, this is going to get worse.  It will come to a stage where Europe will say it can take no more.  What do we do?<\/p> <p>  This committee has been in Africa and has met the most beautiful people one could ever meet.  The traffickers charge an exorbitant fee to bring people across the Mediterranean.  When we go to Malawi and Mozambique, we see how much can be done for a family with the &euro;6 in the cash transfer scheme.  Where do these migrants get the money to pay these exorbitant costs to the traffickers?  These are people not just from Libya but from all over Africa.  Can the EU do more within Africa to keep people there?  Something will have to be done because there will be a clampdown.

That is one of the difficulties because there is no way out for these people.  The minute they embark on the journey, they already owe a lot of money.  The only way for them to pay back that money is to make it to Europe to work and to reimburse the traffickers.<br\/><br\/>Some of them are also misled.  They are told they do not have to pay anything.  Those are mainly the victims of traffickers.  Most of the Nigerian girls I have interviewed will say they have not paid anything but have been promised jobs.  Once they arrive in Europe, they are given the bill that they need to pay.  Then it becomes forced labour or sexual exploitation.<br\/><br\/>For some refugees, such as those from Eritrea or Somalia, they have diasporas abroad.  These people are fleeing conflicts and persecution and rely much on their diaspora.  For that very reason, traffickers know there is money to be made.  They are the ones who are the most abused.<br\/><br\/>Arrivals of migrants to Italy have dropped by 80% this year, yet the political crisis has never been as big as this year.  It is not based on facts but fearmongering.  Up to 80% fewer people are reaching Italian shores.<br\/><br\/>We also need to agree that we want to maintain an asylum system which works and protects people from persecution and conflict.  On the <i>Aquarius<\/i>when we were stranded at sea for several days with no port to disembark at, we had people from Darfur, South Sudan and Eritrea.  We need to agree that these people need our protection.  They would not need to come to Libya to get the protection.  They could get that protection in refugee camps in Sudan and Ethiopia, if there were proper refugee camps there with real opportunities and possibilities for them to make a living.  However, we are forcing these people, with the lack of any opportunity or hope, to undertake a dangerous journey to Europe.<br\/><br\/>Looking at the complex issue of migration, we need to have long-term policies.  We do not address inequalities, lack of development or the lack of rule of law in a week, a month or a year.  However, our politicians and policies are all based on the next electoral deadline.  There are very quick fixes with fearmongering which will get a politician votes rather than well thought through policies.  This is all we ask for.  Of course states have a right to regulate entry and stay.  They also have international obligations.  In Europe we have values.  We believe life is important, that we need to preserve it and that people should not die at sea.  We must have these discussions, but they must be based on proper information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui"},{"type":"speech","time":1530781200,"counter":1514,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their presentation.<\/p><p>It is important that it is made at this stage and that members hear exactly how horrific the conditions are.  We have heard it before.  We have supported M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res's actions.  I wish Mr. Taylor well.<br\/><br\/>Hopefully, NGOs will be allowed to be back at sea to rescue people.  That is the genuine feeling of most Irish people.  Whether they agree or disagree with the European Union, there was a presumption before Ireland signed up to Operation Sophia that we were involved in a humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean.  I have become increasingly concerned, on questioning the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and even with some of the briefings, that the concentration has shifted totally from an Irish point of view to other actions under Operation Sophia and that, as we warned, it is neither a search and rescue mission nor a humanitarian mission any more.  If so, what is it other than the security of Europe?<br\/><br\/>Only yesterday, I received answers back from the Minister of State in respect of future funding on defence in Europe where he outlined an extra &euro;13 billion to be spent between now and 2027 on the European Defence Fund.  In the middle of it, there was an extra &euro;6.5 billion on transport to make the roads and transport networks in the European Union better for military transport or mobility.  This is in contrast with what we spend on what MSF referred to - refugee camps in areas of conflict that can protect people and then try to rebuild their lives in their own countries.  From having spoken to a number of refugees over the years who managed to come as far as Ireland and make good here, I know they never wanted to be in Ireland.  They did not know half of the time whether they were coming here.  They still do not like the weather, even if it is gorgeous at present.  They would prefer to be at home in their own community.<br\/><br\/>What is it that makes people take this arduous journey?  I presume at this stage word is filtering back of the dangers that are faced and that those taken at sea will be sent back to torture camps in Tripoli.  Is Tripoli or any other port regarded by the NGOs as a safe port in any way?  We have had testimony previously about what is ongoing in some of those camps.  Is there much information other than that from the refugees one meets coming from Libya?  What are we hearing back?  Mr. Taylor gave a number of examples and what is going on is quite obscene.  Ireland or the European Union can be seen to be facilitating that by returning refugees to those dangers.<br\/><br\/>I read in <i>The Guardian<\/i>the figures on the number of people who have lost their lives recently and Mr. Taylor repeated them.  Does Mr. Taylor believe the absence of NGO ships at sea contributes to the increased deaths?  Mr. Taylor stated the death toll has gone up substantially in recent times.  Is it that refugees are taking a more arduous journey or are at sea longer?  Are the boats in which they set out in worse condition?  If the NGO ships that were there previously were at sea, would they have the capacity to help in any way beyond what they have done previously?<br\/><br\/>Finally, given what happened in recent weeks, if NGOs get to take to sea again and if the Italians and the European Union continue their policy, I presume it would be much more costly, or probably more dangerous for MSF ships to have to go to other ports in Europe if they are sitting in the middle of the Mediterranean on low supplies trying to figure out where the hell they will go with these refugees to give them some type of comfort and humanity and to avoid facing the torture they fear they would face, were they to get caught and brought back to the Libyan coastguard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#E00600","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530781200,"counter":1516,"content":"<p>MSF, together with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, do not consider that Libya is currently a safe place of disembarkation.  This has been said and repeated by a number of UN bodies.  The High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed his concerns about people being returned to Libya.  We do not even want to open that discussion.  The guidance from the UNHCR is extremely clear.  One who would suggest that Libya is a safe place for migrant refugees and asylum seekers is either not reading the news or completely delusional.<br\/><br\/>I will give some more figures.  The situation at sea is changing.  NGOs currently are not present.  There are other factors and it is difficult to attribute the cause of the increasing mortality rate to the presence or the lack of presence of NGOs.  However, we have all been pushed out.  This has been a campaign of more than a year that started with snide comments in the media about us colluding with traffickers, and then prosecutors in Italy announcing in the media that they were investigating us.  It got to a point where MSF approached the various prosecutors mentioned in the media to tell them we were available to talk and to ask whether they had any questions but that is not the way to conduct an investigation.<br\/><br\/>Then there was the code of conduct that the Italians tried to push last year.  After that, a few NGOs stopped being at sea.  We had also a lot of judicial proceedings against different NGOs and boats being seized.  There were four remaining.  Today, none of us is there and we see an increase in the mortality rate.<br\/><br\/>We also see that the Libyan coastguard has intercepted at sea and returned to Libya 10,000 people this year.  That may explain also the drop in 80% of arrivals to Italy.  These people end up in the detention centres where we intervene and we see them.  They end up with that cycle of abuse.<br\/><br\/>The UN, which is present in Libya, has a very limited capacity.  Libya is not a state with strong institutions.  The UNHCR is not necessarily welcome and the few evacuations that were mentioned that we were able to secure to Niger are a drop in the ocean.  Those have been done after much negotiations.<br\/><br\/>The cost for NGOs, and certainly for MSF, is not about not being able to disembark in Italy and having to go to Valencia.  It is about the fact that those are days when we will not be at sea conducting search and rescue.  We can take the financial cost.  This is not the issue.  There is also the cost for the people who have been rescued.  When the <i>MS Aquarius<\/i>was stranded in the Mediterranean, we had people who had hardly escaped drowning at sea who had pulmonary problems and they were waiting on that boat not knowing whether they would be able to disembark.  The weather conditions were really bad and a lady was trying to breast-feed her baby while throwing up.  This is what not allowing us to disembark meant.  For the people who have just been rescued, they should be able to disembark in the nearest safe port.  This, until now, has been Italy.  It is not only Italy's responsibility.  We are not dogmatic about it.  What we want to see is a place where the rights of people are upheld.  We are not going to disembark people in a place where asylum seekers will not be able to seek asylum and where there will be no guarantees they will not be sent back to their country of origin.<\/p><p>This is the yardstick we apply.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530781200,"counter":1518,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#G00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1530781200,"counter":1519,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses both for their powerful testimony and their ongoing work.  The information they have provided is stark.  What is also stark is that we were warned about these things and they have been signalled for a long time.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, they were signalled when Ireland decided to change its approach.  We ask whether ships with these goals make a difference.  We have previous evidence in this regard.  During the period of a number of years in which Ireland operated on its own and in accordance with the Pontus deal with Italy, which focused on humanitarian search and rescue, just one Irish ship was in operation and Ireland saved 17,500 lives in the Mediterranean, and I think people were so proud of that.  In the same number of years, the subsequent incarnation of Operation Pontus, Operation Sophia, which had - the witnesses may correct me if I am wrong - on average five or six ships, sometimes more and sometimes slightly less, rescued 34,000.  That is five times the number of ships and only twice as many people rescued because the priority of the operation was not humanitarian search and rescue.  The ships are in the same waters and their crew sees the same things.  There are concerns about a shift.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, was very clear when Ireland joined Operation Sophia.  He said in July last year, exactly one year ago, \"Transferring to Operation Sophia will result in the redeployment of Irish Naval Service vessels from primarily humanitarian search and rescue operations to primarily security and interception operations.\"  That is a quote from the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  It is a very clear statement, and that is the decision that was made and which left a space into which NGOs moved.  We have moved from a situation whereby our newspapers in Ireland celebrate and show the search and rescue operations and what our Naval Service has done - and I share the pride in our Naval Service that everyone has expressed - to one whereby we have flipped to concerns, worries and insinuations about operations in respect of which NGOs are perhaps taking the place of the Naval Service.  We need to be very clear: this is bad for Europe because when we start militarising our borders in this way, we see the ripple effects in the militarisation of borders within Europe because that is the next step, and it is bad for our humanitarian reputation.  The idea of the pull factor is really concerning because it is very similar to what we have seen with the Mexican-American border.  The US Administration is not pulling certain families apart and taking children away and interning them because it is concerned about those families; it wants to send an example and a signal.  The idea that we would let people drown as an example or signal to others is the same kind of message and it is not the way to tackle the traffickers.  We have heard about the root causes.  The root causes are not boats.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief in asking my questions.  A family reunification Bill introduced by my group is before the Houses at present.  Regarding the question of tackling trafficking, do the witnesses agree that the financial model and the financial incentives is where this can be tackled by providing safe passage and alternative legal routes for those whose loved ones are living here in Europe to reach them?  This is one reason people take desperate journeys.  Are any of those routes operating out of Libya?  Are people interned in Libya being permitted to make claims or seek reunification or granted access to any of these measures of safe passage?  This is a key question.  Do the witnesses have concerns about EU money financially incentivising the warehousing of people?  Is there a concern that the money may be provided on a per-head basis and that there may be a drive to bring people into Libya and then store them in these detention centres in order that payments be made per head?  We know from private prisons in the US and even from direct provision here that any incentivising of the warehousing of people creates a perverse incentive.  The witnesses might touch on similar migration control agreements that Europe has signed with Sudan.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have concerns about tied aid?  Ireland has had a very strong tradition of untied aid, but increasingly there seems to be a blurring of the line between EU defence spending and what we are told we are investing.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh commented very eloquently on what we put in as actual support as opposed to support to governments.  Again, Sudan comes into this concern.<\/p> <p>  I also have a very quick question about the UN concerns.  What other pressures can Ireland, as a country which is bidding for a Security Council seat at present, bring to bear to show we are very serious about these UN laws?  We mentioned our mass migration in our bid just last week, which is somewhat ironic, given that we have not hit our target of 4,000 refugees and that we have sent 200,000 people abroad ourselves in the past decade.<\/p> <p>  I know these are more statements than anything else, but I ask the witnesses to touch on the financial model, the perverse incentives, the real shift in policy and what it means on the ground for search and rescue and so on, the witnesses' concerns about the militarisation of borders, and perhaps Sudan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#G00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530781200,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator in general for all her questions.

Some of this money is then assigned to Italy, Italy uses it, and this is where we lose track.  It is very easy to say the EU as such - the Commission, for example - does not finance detention centres.  However, there is also this organised system or lack of transparency in order to support that.  For example, the Italian Minister of the Interior, Mr. Salvini, has just announced that ten or 12 more assets will be provided to the Libyan coastguard.  Where is the money coming from?  We ask these questions; we do not get answers.  Perhaps as Members of Parliament, the members will get the answers.  As a European citizen, I also want to ensure that my taxes do not fuel human rights violations.<br\/><br\/>The discourse of some politicians is very much to focus on the pull factor, never to mention the push factors or the complexity of the situation, including the lack of safe and legal routes.  Of Eritreans who make it to Europe, 90% will get asylum there, yet not a single resettlement of an Eritrean to Kenya, Ethiopia or Sudan has taken place.  Family reunification is extremely difficult.  The seriousness of the violations in Libya and the CNN video created some sense of urgency, and then the UNHCR was able to secure a deal with Niger to evacuate to Niger the most vulnerable people.  That was the promise, that these people would be resettled in Europe.  How many have been resettled?  The centre opened in November.  About 200 people have been resettled.  Niger had to suspend the programme because it saw the most vulnerable ones arriving, the unaccompanied minors, the women and the children from Eritrea and Somalia, and they would not be resettled.  When we say &quot;comprehensive&quot;, we are actually only looking to pass the buck to someone else and to ensure that it becomes someone else's problem while promising we will help, yet we never help.  We have the example of the EU-Turkey deal.  How many people have been resettled from Turkey?  How many people are currently stuck in Greece?  My impression from working on these issues is that there is an extremely perverse discourse that is all about bypassing the law.  For example, Italy has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for breaching the prohibition of torture and the principle of <i>non-refoulement<\/i>for its co-operation with the Libyan coastguard.<br\/><br\/>What do we do now?<\/p><p>We now train and equip the Libyan coastguard to set up a search and rescue region.  We get it to do the dirty business for us and to say it is not us.  However, our marks all over this.  We cannot simply say we are doing this in the name of saving lives.  We hear all of the time that we are supporting the Libyan coastguard because it is saving lives.  Of course, no one wants anyone to drown at sea but saving lives means disembarking them in a place of safety, not taking them to detention centres where they might end up in the same cycle of abuse.<\/p><p> On Sudan, I work for MSF Amsterdam.  We do not have an operation in Sudan but other centres do.  I will speak from a non-specialist point of view.  The EU is supporting the rapid intervention force formerly known as the Janjaweed, which says it all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018070500002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530781200,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins asked what Ireland can do.

They are torturing and abusing them.  Of course, we want them to be held responsible, but as a humanitarian organisation what we really want is for the survivors of trafficking to be cared for.  We want them to be granted protection and to have access to the medical care they need, but this is not happening.<\/p> <p>  The EU is trumpeting the fight against trafficking.  Recently, a group of approximately 130 people in Bani Walid escaped from the hands of traffickers during Ramadan.  The went to a mosque and the community in Bani Walid protected them.  The response of the authorities was to send the survivors to detention centres in Tripoli.  This shows how humanitarian messages are being corrupted.  States are paying lip service to saving lives and to humanitarian assistance.  This is very problematic.  Also, NGOs are being corrupted in trying to humanise detention centres so that it becomes more palatable for us to accept that people are sent to detention centres.

Joining me is Mr. Gavin Kelly, CEO of our retail Ireland division, and Mr. John O'Beirne, head of products.  In my opening remarks, I will focus on three key areas; the external environment in which we operate, the transformation under way within Bank of Ireland and how we are responding to a number of key issues facing our sector and our customers.<\/p> <p>  First, I will outline the external environment in which we operate.  As members know, the Irish economy is expanding.  Gross domestic product, GDP, growth has been well above the euro area average since 2011.  This strong performance is translating into job gains with falling unemployment.  More than 2 million people are now at work in Ireland, with figures out this week putting unemployment at just over 5%.  This is down from a peak of almost 16% just a few years ago.  Looking ahead, Ireland is going to see significant change.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, sees a population growing by more than 1 million people, up 50% in cities beyond Dublin, with a one third increase in job creation and a need for half a million new homes.  Bank of Ireland is strongly supporting this growth.  We are the largest lender to the Irish economy, a position held for each of the past four years.  In 2017 we provided &euro;7.1 billion in lending to personal, business and corporate customers across Ireland.  This includes providing more than 50% of all new lending to Irish businesses, including the agricultural sector, and supporting two out of every three companies engaged in Foreign Direct Investment, FDI, in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Banks ultimately exist to support their customers.  Therefore, wherever possible, we work to enable our customers to overcome the challenges they face.  In Ireland today, one of the most pressing of these challenges is access to housing.  We are currently funding the construction of almost 3,000 residential units and 1,700 student accommodation beds in Ireland, and are supporting development on 160 sites across the country.  Last year, we enabled approximately 8,000 people to buy a home in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In the years ahead, we want to do more to support house building and home buying and business and corporate lending.  We recently announced our new strategy.  This reflects both the expanding Irish economy today, and the considerable demographic changes forecast over the coming years.  This strategy will see us playing an even more active role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic development &ndash; growing our loan book by about 20% over the coming four years, with approximately &euro;9 billion lending growth focused primarily on mortgages, business lending and support for construction and development in Ireland.  To help us do this, we have started a significant transformation programme within the Bank.  There are three parts in this programme; culture, technology and our business model.<\/p> <p>  I will first address culture.  A healthy internal culture in any organisation is vital.  However, it is the external proof of this culture that gets the most attention.  Put simply, a good culture creates great customer outcomes.  As part of our culture review work over the last six months we have launched a new purpose statement and set of behavioural values.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s purpose is to enable our customers, colleagues and communities to thrive.  Our values are to be customer focused, accountable and agile, and to work as one team.  To embed our purpose and values within the company, we recently held 50 events for 6,000 colleagues across the Bank in Ireland and in the UK.  We are also reducing the number of layers between head office and our front line.  This will ensure our senior managers are closer to our customers.  That will be positive in a number of ways.  A simpler organisation will empower our people, speed up decision making, and make the bank more responsive to customer needs.<\/p> <p>  Our technology is the second part in our transformation programme.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s systems must be modernised.  This is why we are undertaking a once-in-a-generation investment in our technology.  We are replacing myriad legacy systems with simpler, state-of-the-art technology designed for how customers bank today and into the future.  While core technology is a big part of this, we are also making improvements in our digital channels, services and security.<\/p> <p>  The third part of our transformation programme is our business model, that is, how we are structured and how we serve our customers.  I want to ensure that digital service is combined with a physical presence and personal touch.  This is particularly true for Bank of Ireland.  We are committed to maintaining our extensive branch network, which currently operates in 265 locations in communities across Ireland, the largest reach of any bank.<\/p> <p>  I have listened carefully to feedback from our customers since taking up my role as CEO.  It is clear that we need to improve the service we provide.  Among a number of initiatives, we are now increasing our full-service branches by more than 160%, from 61 to 164.  These branches will have a counter service during the full day, not just morning hours.  We are increasing the number of employees in our branches and contact centres &ndash; again, this is in response to customer feedback on the need for more accessible support for day-to-day banking.  We are also going to continue to use our branch network to support small businesses across Ireland.  Some of our branches in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway offer spaces where startups can work for free.  What we call our Startlabs and FDI hubs, in Dublin, Galway and now New York help companies at the next stage of their development &ndash; growing and expanding into new markets.  We are proud that our branch network is connecting, supporting and enabling the communities we work and live in to thrive.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues facing our sector and our customers which we are also addressing, including Brexit, regulatory capital requirements and the tracker mortgage examination.<\/p><p> On Brexit, having worked in nine countries in different parts of the world, I understand the value of being outward looking.  It is something that has served Ireland very welll from an economic, social and cultural perspective.  Nonetheless, Brexit is a reality for which we must prepare.  We have been working with our customers to provide as much support as possible as they plan for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  We have held 26 \"prepare for Brexit\" events across Ireland.  They are aimed at the small and medium enterprise, SME, community, with partners that include Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce.  Additionally, the bank is a strong supporter of and participant in the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, Brexit loan scheme.  We have held a number of events to inform SMEs of the scheme, its features and how to apply.<\/p><p> With regard to the regulatory capital requirements, banks in Ireland continue to be impacted on by the financial crisis.  We see this in both non-performing exposures, NPEs, and the regulatory capital requirements banks must observe.  At Bank of Ireland, we remain highly focused on reducing our NPEs.  We have made significant progress in that regard, reducing our stock of impaired loans by almost 75% in the past few years.  We have the lowest level of NPEs as a percentage of customer loans of any bank in Ireland.  According to Central Bank statistics, Bank of Ireland is three to four times better in terms of Irish mortgages than the industry average.  Our approach is to work with our customers to put in place sustainable solutions.  We make every effort to support those who want to pay their mortgage and legal action is an absolute last resort.<\/p><p> There is a clear requirement from the regulatory authorities for all European banks to reduce NPEs further and to do so more quickly.  The strategy we presented recently to the market does not assume any change in our proven approach to reducing NPEs.  Given evolving regulatory requirements, especially as they relate to NPEs, we keep our approach to the resolution of non-performing loans under review.  This is to ensure it remains appropriate in order that we can continue to make real progress in reducing our NPEs, while ensuring we retain the capital needed to deliver our strategy.  That strategy is to support loan growth in Ireland, invest in the transformation of our business and deliver returns to our shareholders.<\/p><p> I would like to give an update on the Central Bank of Ireland tracker mortgage examination.  The tracker mortgage issue became a key focus of mine shortly after I took up my position as CEO last October.  I unreservedly apologised to all impacted on customers for the financial loss and anxiety this issue caused them and their families and do so again today.  I set out to make sure we would deal with customers fairly and as quickly as possible.  In recent months we have placed a major focus on our redress and compensation process.  Today, approximately 99% of all affected customers have received an offer of redress and compensation.  Affected customers have been offered redress and compensation of over &euro;137 million, of which approximately 90% or more than &euro;123 million has been paid so far.  For the remaining offers, as soon as offer forms are returned to us, payment will be made swiftly.  Approximately 1% of customers impacted on have yet to be offered redress and compensation.  This equals about 80 accounts, with a redress and compensation amount of &euro;1.1 million, or an average of around &euro;14,000 per account.  They are mostly cases in which a customer&rsquo;s address has changed, including when a customer has moved abroad.  There are also some cases in which the customer is deceased, with no contact information on record for their representative or solicitor.  The bank is actively attempting to trace all customers or their estates in order that we can makes offers in each outstanding case.<\/p><p> I have provided some context regarding the economy and the economic, demographic and housing demand we will see in Ireland in the coming period.  I have highlighted some of the issues our sector and customers face and how we are responding to them.  I have outlined the transformation under way at Bank of Ireland, including in our culture, technology and business model.  I thank the committee for giving us its time and look forward to our discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1545,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh for her presentation.

Two and a half weeks ago I presented our strategy from now until 2021 to the market.  Within that we were very specific about our ambition to support our customers - personal, corporate and small business customers - to be successful.  A big part of doing that is by being the leading supporter of house building and home buying in Ireland.  We see that as a need for both the customers and companies that we want to support.  One of the issues that is facing many of our customers, and no doubt many of the Deputies constituents, is rising house prices.  We see that as driven mainly by a mismatch between supply and demand.  Ireland is growing in demographics and in GDP and average household sizes in Ireland are relatively large when compared to the European average because people want to move out and get their own home and renting or purchasing it can be prohibitively expensive.  For us, the solution to that is to support companies to construct properties and homes that are appropriate for Irish home buyers or tenants.  We see an opportunity to support that need.  <\/p> <p>  Last year we provided 8,000 mortgages to customers wanting to buy a new home or move home.  We provided corporate clients with support to build 3,000 homes in Ireland; I mentioned in my opening statement that we also supported 1,700 student beds, which is a challenge, and we are helping 160 construction sites to get built.  There is still a gap.  We expect that there would be around 40,000 residential units needed per annum to meet demand and last year I believe 15,000 were built.  That is still driving an increase in property prices.  For us, our role, as the largest lender in Ireland, is to support the companies to build the properties and for the people to move into them with mortgages that are attractive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#F02100","nonspeaker":"Ms Francesca McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1584,"content":"<p>Does Ms McDonagh think that supply is coming when that mismatch of 25,000 units of a shortfall year on year is looked at?

Nine out of every ten new mortgages are at a fixed rate, particularly for first-time buyers of whom only 2% look for a standard variable rate.  We believe we offer very good value across all loan-to-value ratios and terms between one and five years.  Our customers tell us they value the cashback offer and it is a shame to take cash out of the pockets of Irish consumers when they need it most, which is when they move house and need curtains and carpets etc.  There is a real value in the cashback offer in this context.  Combined with a clear, consistent and simple product offering, supported by a process in which we have invested time and effort to improve it for our customers, we think we have a very attractive offering and our customers must think so too, because our market share has increased from 25% in 2016 to 27% at the end of last year.

The rate of 3%, regardless of loan to value, LTV, for between one and five years, is designed to bring simplicity and clarity and ensure there is no confusion in how we market the offer.

To lend in a way that is non-sustainable or not to consider the risk parameters appropriately would be bad for this sector in the economy and the individuals concerned.

How can that risk be reduced because we have a situation where people are telling us that they cannot get the funding, to the point that the State is introducing legislation to make the State's funding available because there is a view that the banks are not providing the funding to the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#J00450","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1623,"content":"<p>Obviously the construction industry is starting to reform and we have evidence of that from the 15,000 units built last year.

Typically we would look to fund about 60% of the transaction and I say typically, because each one is unique and we sit down with each customer and work through the cash flows for the site, the plans they have for building.

I cannot project whether that will endure but the supply and demand dynamic is beginning to have the effect of some reduction in house price inflation.  Prices are still rising but at a slower rate.

As part of our change last year, between 800 to 1,000 staff were put out to support communities.  The committee will have come across this as it was referenced last year by the Senator.

We had 265 locations and 100 of those are now self-service and advice branches and will remain so.  Before we made the change, typically in those branches we would have seen 20 to 30 over the counter transactions per day.  A teller has the capacity to handle a lot more transactions than that during the day.  As part of the change we moved the teller from inside behind a pane of glass to outside, onto the floor of the branch, to meet the customers' needs and requirements.  Some 99% of transactions that happen in branches are lodgements and withdrawals.  These transactions can now be done at our self-service machines in the 100 branches and can also be done 24-7 at the external lodgement ATM.<\/p> <p>  The change referred to by Ms McDonagh earlier was around the middle group of branches, where in approximately 100 branches we close the cash transactions at 12.30 p.m.  When we spoke to customers after this change they told us that this was confusing.

Individuals with mortgages for houses in such developments were not treated very well and found that they had houses but no proper facilities, roads or infrastructure.  Some developers funded through mainstream banks are at a disadvantage because of a higher cost of capital than might be the case if they sourced capital from funds.  There is a difficulty in that regard.  There has been a big change in how developers are funded.

The bank is investing &euro;250 million to, as the plan describes, \"broaden the extent of transformation to deliver business model benefits and accelerate the reduction in [its] cost base\".  It has been widely reported that this will mean job losses, particularly at middle management levels.  Can Ms McDonagh set out the bank's plans in this regard?

We talked about loan growth and reshaping our UK business, and we talked about transformation and a cost reduction to get to a total cost base of &euro;1.7 billion by 2021.  In order to get there we do not have any headcount reduction targets that have been agreed internally; therefore they have not been shared externally.  We will reduce our costs in a number of ways.  One way is by improving our efficiency through improving the end-to-end journey to customers, digitising more of our business and changing how we are organised.  We are doing that already by making the bank a simpler organisation.

Unfortunately, the forum does not permit all the subcontractors to be here so we take this opportunity to thank all those involved for their work and support to date.<br\/><br\/>As members will be aware, the collapse of Carillion, which was a joint partner in the Inspired Spaces consortium delivering the public private partnership, PPP, bundle 5 schools, and the subsequent liquidation of the builder, Sammon Contracting Ireland, have ensured that these building works will now be completed by a new main building contractor.<br\/><br\/>Our group represents a number of specialist subcontractors who were engaged by Sammon to deliver the buildings.  We began meeting informally to share information when it became clear to us that there were growing financial issues with both Carillion and Sammon.<br\/><br\/>We have been invited here to give our input in regard to irregularities in the certification processes for the school projects.  We hope to outline the context and scope of these concerns and the potential implications for the delivery of the schools.  Further to that, we will also address more wide-ranging issues regarding PPPs, the delivery of the PPP company and the remit of the NDFA, on which the committee has previously heard evidence.<br\/><br\/>It has become clear that for several of these projects the assigned certifier intends to certify large portions of works undertaken by specialist subcontractors without providing relevant documentary evidence, which has become routine, using the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, certification system.  This approach has become accepted practice due to building control guidance and project precedent.  These precedents include all previous PPP schemes and standard building contracts that I and other subcontractors have been part of; we know that is the standard.<br\/><br\/>We strongly question the ability of any certifier to ensure that all relevant building regulations have been met, that the works have been carried out as designed, and that all the building products are compliant without the support of ancillary certification from the specialist subcontractors who carried out the works.<br\/><br\/>In essence, these certifiers intend to move well outside the established precedent of evidence-based submissions and ancillary certification.  This has wide-ranging potential for implications for the health and safety of the eventual occupants, who in these specific cases will be mostly children and young adults.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that the current building control management systems were introduced after several high-profile failures.  The problems were eventually recognised to be partly due to systemic failures, which the current system was designed to address.  One high profile example was the evacuation of the Priory Hall apartments in Donaghmede in 2011 due to the dangers presented by substandard works and lack of inspections.<br\/><br\/>The current BCAR system relies on an evidence-based approach, ensuring there is a clear record of works being completed to the required standards, and to meet the design specification.  In essence, it becomes a risk management strategy, overseen by the assigned certifier who assumes the legal responsibility simply to collate this information.<br\/><br\/>It is clearly stated in the code of practice for certifiers that the role of the certifier does not include responsibility for the certification of any builder.  That is why the BCAR system is relied upon and begs the question: if ancillary certification from specialist subcontractors was a requirement of the original contract with us, Sammon Contracting Ireland and building control approval, what has changed?<br\/><br\/>The proposed approach by the assigned certifier would be similar to the historical <i>laissez-faire <\/i>attitude to building control compliance, something the current systems and legislation were specifically put in place to avoid.  Committee members will be in no doubt about the headline issues such as structure, fire safety and environmental performance being regulated by building control legislation but that regulation also extends to virtually every element of building works, for example, technical guidance document D.<br\/><br\/>Our group comprises contractors specialising in many different areas.  We are able and willing to demonstrate in detail, if required, numerous building elements where it is extremely difficult to see how certification can be achieved without our support.  Most of these arguments are technical in nature, relating to the specifications and performance issues of products and installations.<br\/><br\/>With regard to some issues, for example, CE marking of the structural steel elements that hold up the buildings or various elements of floor covering systems, it is impossible for any third party to provide certification.  As we have said, these issues with the certification of the building could also have a knock-on effect on the contractual arrangements between the State and the NDFA and the delivery consortium.  Perhaps more important, the risks will have real-world effects on the students who use the facilities should they be unavailable, which could affect the value delivered by the projects considerably.<br\/><br\/>The potential for delay in building control certification could lead to the current temporary arrangements for the affected schools having to continue for an unknown timescale.  Should there be challenges to the final certification of the schools, occupation and use of the buildings could be further delayed.  Ultimately, should certification be granted and subsequently removed, the buildings occupants would have to leave and services re-sited.<br\/><br\/>In these circumstances, it has been made clear by the NDFA that the financial risk falls to the PPP company rather than the State.  This is true in that the facilities would be unavailable and thus penalties applied, but it appears that the consequences have been somewhat overlooked.  In this case, it would mean that facilities are not available to students.  It is difficult to argue that risk transfer and value for money are working as intended if students are not in their places of study.  This is especially true should there be any widespread failure of building elements or systems due to inappropriate certification leading to longer periods of unavailability, especially considering that the sites have been unattended for several months.<br\/><br\/>The PPP contracts allow for deductions in payments should facilities or services not be available.  This seems reasonable in smaller instances, for example, classrooms not being available for an afternoon or even several days due to a leaking pipe.  It does not seem to be designed to allow for the loss of an entire school which, considering current proposals and our concerns around the law regarding certification, is a distinct possibility.<br\/><br\/>As we have no contractual arrangements directly with the NDFA, we also hope to use this forum to get clarification on several points.  The first is that whether this type of potential large-scale failure of service and facilities has been examined in any risk analysis of the projects.  We also question the ability of the PPP company and the certifier to demonstrate that the original specification has been met.  Design and construction changes at all stages had to be shown by subcontractors to whom I have spoken to meet specifications.  We know of numerous examples that can be provided whereby changes to design elements have occurred.  Without the support of the subcontractors and manufacturers involved, these changes cannot be reliably shown to meet the specification originally set out.<br\/><br\/>In previous evidence to the committee, the NDFA has also referred to independent advice in regard to building control and specification issues.  Should it confirm if this advice is also provided by the assigned certifier?  While we do not intend to question the professional integrity of any persons, it seems counter-intuitive that a party employed by the PPP company could be seen to offer independent advice to the client or the NDFA.<br\/><br\/>While the NDFA has been clear that it does not have any responsibility regarding payments to subcontractors, it seems that meeting building specification falls strongly under its remit.  We would ask for further detail on how it intends to ensure that the full specification is met.<br\/><br\/>Another issue we would like to raise in regard to the collapse of Sammon is that of retention moneys.  Many subcontractors have completed works on previous Sammon publicly financed projects, met all necessary standards and agreed final accounts for their work.  They have been paid for their contract but they have not been paid in full.  A portion of the final contract sum is retained during the liabilities and defects period.  In some cases, these sums are substantial.  These moneys are now due and we believe are held by the State.<\/p><p>As Sammon does not exist, the contracts cannot be completed, leaving contractors out of pocket yet again.  To our knowledge, no contractual arrangements exist to recover these payments, which are plainly owed to contractors as retained moneys.  Can the NDFA comment on this, or is it again outside its remit?<\/p><p> Considering all the issues which have been raised, we are also forced to question the PPP model more generally.  A main stated aim is the transfer of risk to the private sector.  We point out that in this case the risks have been transferred back to Irish citizens and businesses through a series of holding companies and funds.  It is they who have suffered considerable financial damage and personal stress due to this collapse, again bringing the real-world implications of risk transfer into sharp focus.<\/p><p> There is a huge issue of fairness which seems to have been overlooked when designing the PPP contracts.  The NDFA has oversight of finances until the point where it truly matters, when paying those who carry out the works.  We are in a situation where students will be using buildings and equipment that have not been paid for.  This is in no way morally acceptable.  <\/p><p> It was acknowledged that cherry picking occurs from subcontractors, in that certain specialties are paid to provide certification.  Again, this is morally wrong.  Some contractors do not have the option of withholding certification, and it would be reprehensible should they not also be paid for work carried out.<\/p><p> As a group we are ready and willing to engage constructively to resolve these issues.  The NDFA has produced a detailed briefing paper regarding payments to Sammon subcontractors for the committee.  We ask the committee to ensure the issues raised<\/p><p>today are clarified in a similar manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hennebry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1842,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hennebry.

We have been in business for more than 60 years.  We supplied schools bundle 5 and parts of schools bundles 3 and 4.  Out of those five schools bundle projects, 40% or two out of five have failed, which is a high failure rate.  Approximately 12 schools in total have been affected.  PPP schools have been run by facility management companies for 20 years, which replace furniture that is damaged, including table-tops, replacement feet, chairs and so on.  The schools under these schemes have lost all control over the management of their own schools, to the extent that the caretaker cannot even change a light bulb, and the principal cannot update his furniture to suit the latest methods of teaching which are standard in other European countries, such as group work and other methods.  I can speak only on my own behalf as a school furniture manufacturer.<\/p> <p>  We furnish seven to ten new school builds on average annually, and we also look after existing customers.  In the 33 years of business that we have run it ourselves, we have never experienced anything like this.  At this time, we are owed &euro;250,000.  In layman's terms, this is approximately &euro;1 million's worth of work to cover the costs.  This has a knock-on effect.  We work on a 30-day credit term with both customers and suppliers.  As one can imagine, this puts a financial strain on our company.  We have been waiting for nine months for payment for furniture that is in schools.  We have been told through the media that these schools will open in September.  How?  They have furniture from our company that has not been paid for.  That is not right and it will not happen.  <\/p> <p>  We received liquidation letters from companies involved which clearly state the first creditor to be paid will be Revenue, the Government body.  The mistake was not ours as the subcontractors.  We, as subcontractors, should be paid first, before the Government bodies, because the error was not ours.  It always seems to be the small man who carries the can.  We are a small company which has to do due diligence on all customers and suppliers alike.  Who has done due diligence on the companies in question, if any due diligence was done?  We have signed no contracts with the companies involved.  This furniture was supplied on an order-invoice basis.  All invoices clearly state goods do not pass until invoices have been paid in full.  We were told we cannot access these buildings to reclaim our furniture, which has not been paid for, because we would be trespassing and would be held in contempt.  One can imagine how surprised we were when we heard the schools will open in September with furniture that has not been paid for.  The Department of Education and Skills has washed its hands of this until the schools are completed.  It must be resolved, and the Department needs to become involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tina Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1844,"content":"<p>I thank Ms. Walsh.

Eventually, at Christmas, we said we would pull the security from the site, and we were paid one invoice.  After Christmas we went after them again and we were paid a second invoice.  We are still owed money to the tune of &euro;16,000.  That is our working capital, and it puts a strain on us and on our relationship with the banks.  It means that for us to take on work now, we have to pay upfront.  All our men were paid at Christmas.

I realised my predicament was not as bad as others.  When one rings a company now, one rings the man on site, which might turn out to be the husband.  The phone will ring and then go through to a secretary, who is his wife. If one wants to get the real story, talk to the wives and one will hear it.  The wife will say not to tell the husband what she said.

We were fortunate and happy to be able to work through the worst recession this country has endured.  We seemed to be able to manage, to do our jobs and keep everything nice and tight.  We ran a tight ship.  At the start of the upturn, this project came along.  The main reason we took it on was because it was a government job.  When I heard that it was a government job I thought it would be a safe, secure job.  Having traded through a bad recession, this is the first time we have been hit with a company owing us money.  Our suppliers have reduced our credit limit from approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;5,000 per month.  We can go through &euro;5,000 in five working days, which leaves us trying to finance ourselves for the rest of the month.  We have tried to open up accounts with other creditors.  One is almost on one's knees begging for credit.  I have traded through the recession.  We have been hit in this instance but we are fighting back.  We will continue to fight back.  We will not let this do us down but it will be a hard long slog to get back to where we were.<\/p> <p>  We have been trading in Dublin for 20 years but it feels like we just walked into Dublin last week in that we are starting from scratch trying to access credit.  As Mr. Hennebry said, when tendering for jobs one knows the materials that will be needed but we cannot tender for work because we do not have the credit to supply materials.  This is putting us back a long way.  Thankfully, we have picked up one project that I have to try to manage myself.  I have not taken a salary from the company since December.  I had to let my office staff go so I have to run the office and the site myself.  I am trying to ensure I have wages for my staff and I am tendering for work.  I had to let three staff go, the weight of which is on my shoulders.  As stated by Mr. Hennebry, we are just engrossed in the work.  When we go home at night, it is very hard not take the work home with us.  As much as we try, we cannot do it.  If one has a bad day, it is hard to put it at the back of one's mind and not take it home.  I emphasise that one of the reasons we took on this contract was it was a government project.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#U00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1857,"content":"<p>Reference was made in the opening statements to morality and the ambition to have available those modern schools built by the witnesses to children and educators next September.

Maybe it would be possible to some extent in the UK but not in Ireland.  It has never been tested as far as I am aware but there are historical reasons for the system that is in place.  We do not believe anyone else can certify and we would be willing to challenge any such decision.<\/p> <p>  On the retraction of the certifications that are in Wexford - the Deputy's question was specific to Wexford - again it is on completion and the contract is not complete until somebody has paid.

My mission today is to find out what members can do to ensure we get paid for works carried out.  We are dancing around the edges, while legalities, barristers, pickets, financial statements and state of health are all issues in a big pot.  The big question is whether the Government can stand over not paying us.  Can it stand over skipping off out the back door and bringing in a new certifier to ensure we are not paid?<\/p> <p>  The Government, State and Department of Education and Skills are in control of some &euro;250 million, which they will pay to a Dutch finance firm they engaged in the first place.  It looks like they are trying to do as much as they can as quickly as they can and eliminate or ignore us.  By doing that, they are ensuring the Dutch company gets its full and total payment of &euro;150 million profit, subsidised by us who have paid our staff.  It seems the Government also wants VAT from us.  It is keeping our retention and for us to stay in business it wants us to keep the Revenue Commissioners happy by paying them money that the Government refuses to pay us.  It is a naive of the Minister to choose not to meet us.  The finance company does not want to meet us.  We are being ignored.  The Minister stated on television that the State was at no financial risk.  He should wake up because we are contributing to his existence.  We pay our way and pay Revenue and we did so through a bad recession, yet this is the answer we are getting.<\/p> <p>  We are not on trial today.  All of us survived a recession when we were paid poor rates, had high costs and had to get rid of staff.  As Mr. Kelly said, he had to let girls out of his office go.  We are not on trial.  All those who are hanging on to ministerial, departmental and Government stuff and trying to bypass us are out of order in the sense that not one euro of the &euro;250 million has departed the coffers of the State.  Meanwhile, &euro;4 million is the figure bandied around for contingency works such as roundabouts, lead-ins, footpaths, gateways and entrances.  Not one penny has been paid to the schools.<\/p> <p>  If the members do not have an idea how to help us, I ask that, before the Government makes any payment to any financier, it should create a contingency fund for people who have paid into the State but have not been paid for work on these sites.  We are not looking for a subsidy or contribution like those paid in agriculture.  This is not a subsidy but a reimbursement to people who worked and were paid for revenue that was paid to the Exchequer on their behalf.  We are unpaid collectors of Revenue money.  We have paid, otherwise we would not have our C2 tax clearance certificate or access code, as it is now known.<\/p> <p>  It is very simple.  There is &euro;250 million in the hands of whoever controls the project here, be it the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education and Skills.  That money remains unpaid.  We have carried out work for which we have not been paid.  We are not looking for delay money, penalty clauses or anything, just the price agreed on the day we qualified to do the job.  If we qualified on day one, we are still qualified.  We do not need to be court-martialled, assessed or certified and no verification is needed of whether we did it right or wrong.  We were under scrutiny throughout the project.<\/p><p>We were scrutinised by representatives of Carillion which seemed to think it was a good idea to send them over to keep an eye on us.  We passed that test and our work is done.  Our invoices have been submitted and we are not paid.  How will the committee ensure that we get reimbursed and not cost the State in investigative costs such as lawyers, barristers and going to court without the necessity picket a site?  This is simple.  How does one solve it without that necessity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#BB00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1898,"content":"<p>We will answer that question for Mr. Miley before the end of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1899,"content":"<p>I was hoping it would be before the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Miley"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1900,"content":"<p>Before the end of this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>I thought the Chairman said, \"end of the week.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Miley"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1902,"content":"<p>No, before the end of this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC00600","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1903,"content":"<p>Apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Miley"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1904,"content":"<p>The second question I asked was whether there is any kind of a liaison with the NDFA.

I am sorry we had to go for the vote earlier on.<\/p> <p>  It is clear what has happened here in terms of the Government responsibility.  We had the NDFA in before us the other day.  In terms of the failure to conduct due diligence, the NDFA failed.  As to whether the Government needs to sue the audit company that stood over the accounts of the company the contract was awarded to, that is an option that Government needs to be seriously looking at.  The buck has to stop somewhere.<\/p> <p>  The decision made was obviously the wrong decision and the sub-contractors were at the end of the food chain in the sense of the impact.  It will continue to have an impact because through no fault of their own their creditworthiness in the future will be brought into question.  The Government has a responsibility to protect indigenous businesses such as these first, second and third generation businesses.  That is what would seem to me to be the first step.  We, as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, should suggest that the Government put such protection in place immediately.<\/p> <p>  When I asked the NDFA the other day whether it had correspondence with the audit company involved, the NDFA's representatives stated they did not.  They need to enter into formal engagement with the audit company because it gave them misleading information in terms of standing over the accounts.<\/p> <p>  I am a parent of somebody going to school.  If one does not pay for something, one has stolen it.  It is as simple as that.  It is the Government's responsibility.  Sending children into a school where they will be asked to use stolen property is so unethical it is off the scale.  What else can parents do in that situation?  Is it the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills?  It comes back to what Mr. Miley said.  We need to get who is responsible.  The Government is responsible for that.  They are responsible for the situation that the sub-contractors find themselves in and they are responsible for the situation that they will put children, parents and families in come September if this is not resolved.  There is a small window of opportunity there to resolve it.  For the Government to put a contingency fund in place that will assure these businesses in the future, ensure that the furniture is paid for and then sort it out with the main audit company, would be the clearest way that I would see it being done.  In terms of the certification for the other company, it must be compelled to bring this company on board to be able to certify the work done to date.  It needs to be instructed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what the Chair is saying as to whether Mr. Miley will have an answer going out of here today, it has been valuable to have Mr. Miley here.  In one sense, I wish Mr. Miley had been here before the NDFA because one could see that there was this hands-off approach of it being nothing to do with them.  All of us, collectively, on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, know it had everything to do with them and everything to do with the original decision that they made.  It may be that we will even have to bring the NDFA back in here but there will be specific actions that we should be able to take at the end of the hearing today.<\/p> <p>  I will not take any more time.  We are much clearer now on what needs to be done than we were before we heard the presentations from the sub-contractors.  We also feel, even though many of us are not in government, an obligation to ensure that theft is not facilitated which, to me, is what has happened here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC01200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1909,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway-Walsh for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#CC01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hennebry"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1910,"content":"<p>It was facilitated and the facilitators must be held to account.

They said two things which I ask the delegates to consider.<\/p><p>It was said that it has two reasons for its existence.  One is to give advice in relation to the funding of all of these projects and the other is to ensure the delivery of the PPP contracts.  It is in the delivery of the contracts that it has failed, because the subcontractors are not part of the conclusion to the contract or finalising it and they are due the payment.  Mr. Miley asked what can we do.  The purpose of hearing from the NDFA was to establish its position within this structure of companies that now exists.  I do not know whether the witnesses have seen a copy of the transcript of the meeting but we will make it available to them.  We then wanted to establish the number of contractors and how we can assist.  I can safely say from what members are saying that it would be our view that we would consider either bringing back in the NDFA, sending the transcripts to the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills among others, and making some form of recommendation as to how we feel the subcontractors should be dealt with, and how they should be included in the process of payments in some way.  There is a responsibility on the State to ensure that happens.  That is my firm view on it.  While we do not have the authority to instruct the Department of Finance, we certainly have the pressure within the committee to begin to raise the matter, perhaps as a report to the D&aacute;il, and to ensure further engagement with the agencies of the State that we feel are responsible for this, and that is what we will do.  To the extent of our remit, we will pursue the issue to the nth degree.

The alternative to that is to, for instance, get some advice from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the same area in that this is a significant public project.  What we are being told is that, notwithstanding a lot of legal structures around the contract, the suggestion is that there is in fact no legal status for the subcontractors in relation to the fact that the contract has collapsed.

The hardest thing today is to hear the stories of the witnesses and the reality of what is happening to our own people who have done the work.  My biggest issue is the fact that the witnesses are here crying and looking for something they deserve, that they have worked for.  They are coming to beg from the Government today for something they have done.  That is unacceptable in the sense that they are now all under pressure.  Families are feeling it.  We have heard the stories today.  I commend the witnesses on their bravery.  They should not have to come here.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Miley referred to me.  I addressed the Minister for Education and Skills twice on this in the Seanad and I got nowhere.  I sent the replies back to the contractors with whom I was dealing in Carlow.  The Minister led us all to believe that this was not in his remit and that he could not interfere.  That is unacceptable.  The Government must step in and address the issue because we need to make sure the subcontractors are paid.  We need to make sure that their family lives are brought back to normal.<\/p><p>It is like what previous speakers said.  When someone hears of a PPP and it is Government, they feel they are guaranteed their funding.  That has always been the way.  One will be paid if it is a Government contract but that has not happened here.  Have the witnesses set up a group because I know there have been different meetings?  I know we had the meetings in Carlow.  Before we meet again, and we need to meet again, the witnesses should get a proper group together.  They know the old saying.  The more they stand together, the more meetings subcontractors hold and the more they get a group together to fight this, the better.  They cannot do without this money and it is unacceptable.  The witnesses should get a group together from here and work through this committee and all of us because I am here to give them 100% support.  I think it is unacceptable in 2018.  I have to say this because every day in the Seanad, we hear about how funding is there, the country is on track and building is back but if we cannot pay our own subcontractors, what are we doing?  We need to address this.  The Minister needs to be brought here.  He would not have a meeting.  I think he needs to have a meeting with the witnesses.  Perhaps we could arrange it either through the Seanad or D&aacute;il.  We need to get the Minister in.  The Minister needs to be accountable.  Funding needs to be set up for subcontractors so that they get their money and their lives get back on track.  <\/p><p> Regarding certification, the witnesses know that if they apply for another job, they must pay their taxes and have their certificate.  How can they do it when they are not getting money from the Government, yet it wants them to pay taxes to Revenue?  This does not add up.  I am asking for a meeting with the Minister and that the subcontractors get together and form a proper group.  Whatever road we have to take to fight this, I will give them 100% support.  I thank the witnesses for coming before us today because it was very brave to come in here to a finance committee and tell it what is happening; this is the reality and the Minister and Government need to hear it and wake up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#EE01500","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1976,"content":"<p>To clear up a point raised by Deputy Doherty at the last meeting, I was dealing with the certification process in a lot of detail.

It states that a summary of the legal position as it understands it is outlined in the correspondence.  It states that in signing its part of the certificate of compliance and completion, the assigned certifier will rely upon a number of ancillary certificates from others involved in the work.  It states that while the majority of those ancillary certificates are available for the project, some are not.  It states that for those work elements where the ancillary certificate is not available, the replacement main contractor will engage new third party subcontractors to complete any outstanding works for the relevant elements and to provide ancillary certificates covering both their own work and the work carried out by previous subcontractors from whom ancillary certificates are not available.  This is from the deputy director, Mr. Cahillane.  I find that totally unacceptable.  Mr. Miley spoke about bypassing the subcontractors.  The very purpose of this meeting is to ensure that subcontractors are not bypassed.  It is to ensure that this type of legal position is not adopted.  We want a very basic position to be adopted, which is to pay the contractors the outstanding amount of money they are due.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#FF00700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530779400,"counter":1982,"content":"<p>In respect of the statement touched on by Deputy Doherty the other day that I saw, Part D of the building regulations clearly states that no other person can be involved.

That is the question.  As a committee, we would not want to give some subcontractors leaving here today a false sense of security that they are going to get paid in a week's or a month's time.  This committee must work out how best to get the money for them as quickly as possible.  We could bring the NDFA back next week or we could bring in the Minister or this person or that person but that is only an engagement with a process.  How to get them the money they are owed is the question.  Does it require a legal process?  That is the question I will be asking.  As Deputy Burton mentioned earlier on, do we require legal advice?  Is that the only road that can be travelled to secure the money they are owed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#FF01100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1986,"content":"<p>We will seek legal advice from services here.

Deputy Deering asked about the way to resolve this.<\/p><p>The way to resolve this is simple.  It is to apply a bit of common sense to the work that was done and to acknowledge it.  The Government should set aside a sum to pay the contractors.  It is &euro;14 million out of a spend in excess of &euro;5.5 billion.  As such, it is a small amount of money by comparison to what is being spent, but it is a significant amount to the contractors.  We will be pursuing that course also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#FF01200","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1988,"content":"<p>I was going to say what was possible for any of the members of the Government involved in this, including the Ministers for Education and Skills and Finance, in particular, and, possibly, even the Taoiseach.  This is a significant level of public works and we want the children, parents and teachers in the town get their school.  However, we would also like the contractors to be paid.  The responsibility is shared across government.  The solution is to bring a memorandum to Cabinet to indicate that there is a recognition.  I am not a lawyer, but the subcontractors as a group need good legal advice as to whether they can consider the courts as an option.  This is possible for the Government, however, notwithstanding that it says it cannot touch the PPP process.  We know that is not completely true from the UK experience, although it is a very strong legal mechanism.  One of the responsible Ministers or the Government collectively could bring to Cabinet a memorandum to say the subcontractors' issues will be addressed.  While they might not get 100%, they might get some contingency payments during the examination of what has happened to the various amounts that have been paid out but in respect of which they are at a loss and in danger of going under.  The Government should act on a humanitarian basis but also on a reputational basis in circumstances in which providers should not be left out of pocket where the State is contracting for important services.  That is the other issue the committee might put to the Government in a report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#GG00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1989,"content":"<p>We will consider all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#GG00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1990,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and, in particular, for sharing their personal stories.  I noted to Ms Kelly that it is not an easy thing because we are in this room and other people are watching.  I am sure the NDFA is watching.  The Chairman talked about a number of options for the committee, albeit we cannot instruct.  There is a terrible mess here and the consequences are clearly wider than issues of hard cash.  There are risks of job losses and risks to family businesses.  We have heard the personal testimonies.  The solution is simple.  The NDFA must be assured that the works carried out meet the requirements of building control legislation.  There is no way it can assure itself of that without the subcontractors certifying those works.  The NDFA needs to revisit this and make it clear to Woodvale that the only way this can be done is by re-engaging with the subcontractors, having the works completed if they are not completed and getting the certification from the subcontractors.  That will mean every subcontractor gets paid which will, in turn, bring an end to their financial and personal misery.  It will take us until next week to put all this together, but if the NDFA is listening now, I urge it to waste no time engaging with Woodvale on that course of action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018070500002#GG00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1530779400,"counter":1991,"content":"<p>the Deputy has covered all of the ground.
