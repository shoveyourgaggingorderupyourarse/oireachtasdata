We are all aware of elderly or ill persons in our areas who have had to put up with an inordinate level of documentation and double checking in proving their illnesses.  At this stage in their lives they are entitled to a little more human dignity.  The State surely owes them this.  I again propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health come to the House to discuss this issue, the &euro;300 million overrun - double the figure predicted by him, although not double the amount I predicted last February - and what he perceives to be the success of the special delivery unit in cutting waiting lists, which is a figment of his imagination, as the figures speak for themselves.<\/p> <p>There has been a 40% increase in the number of people waiting for more than three months, a 97.7% increase in the number waiting for more than six months and a tenfold increase in the number waiting for more than one  year.  It is much more worrying that waiting lists for children have more than doubled.  A total of 26,245 children are waiting for more than three months for surgery, which is fundamentally unacceptable.<\/p><p>I do not mean to be personal, but we must judge people on their performance.  The Minister abolished the HSE board and appointed his own board and interim chief executive officer.  He said the buck would stop with him and that he would run the board.  He has run it for two years, but there is still a headless chicken approach, with a &euro;300 million overrun this year and &euro;660 million supposedly to be saved next year.  It is to be saved in front-line services, yet the chief executive officers of the main hospitals have told us services are creaking at the seams.  When will common sense prevail?  What is the Taoiseach owed by the Minister that he is not prepared to take action and put somebody different in the Department who might have the confidence of the people and might show a little competence in managing &euro;13 billion of their money?  Nobody knows where it is going.  There are overruns every year and the HSE is focusing on the Marie Flemings of this world to gather up a few shillings, while the salaries of hospital chief executive officers are being topped up with money from charities.  There will be an amendment to the Order of Business every day until there is clarity and progress on this issue.  Two and a half years in, this level of incompetence would not be tolerated of a committee in a town or a council and it should not be by a Government of one Department that has control of a large number of tax dollars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700002#A00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385548200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>A number of us raised the issue of Seanad reform on the Order of Business yesterday in the light of the announcement of proposed changes to the university panels.  I am delighted the Cabinet signed off on the proposal to amend legislation on the Seanad electorate for the university panels to extend the franchise to graduates of all third level institutions.  Today's newspapers report that this could mean as many as 750,000 people having a vote, which is a significant expansion of the electorate, given that the current electorate for Trinity College Dublin and the National University of Ireland is approximately 150,000.  The legislation will need to be enacted well in advance of the next election to make it practically workable and it is welcome that it will be published in the new year.  I understand there will be consultation, which is also welcome, but it needs to be introduced without delay.  Will the Leader schedule a debate on it early in the new year?<\/p><p>I omitted yesterday to refer to the sad death of Fr. Alec Reid who played such an important role in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  Last week, in the light of the comments made by John Larkin, the Northern Ireland Attorney General, a number of us asked for a debate early in the new year on the peace process and the difficult negotiations under way not only on how to deal with the past but also on current issues such as flags and parades.  It has been some time since we had a debate on Northern Ireland issues, although I acknowledge the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has regular meetings.  However, it would be good to have a debate in the House.<\/p><p>The appalling treatment of Marie Fleming and Tom Curran by the HSE is awful.  The bureaucracy they had to encounter is troubling, given the difficult position they are in.  However, as the T&aacute;naiste said, we need to move to address the core issue for them - the right to die - and to examine again how we can ensure legislation is amended to bring it within the terms of the Constitution to make sure we allow defences to the current offence of aiding and abetting suicide where somebody is the position of Marie Fleming and Tom Curran.

Can that issue be debated and fully appraised in order that is not an instinctive reaction?  The estates in question have been the subject of planning permission; there are access roads, pipes for water and sewers and sites have been cleared, while some buildings have had foundations laid and so on.  Recent sales of houses on a ghost estate in County Monaghan show there is a market for them.  People trade low housing cost against the massive debts some have, unfortunately, incurred which we are trying to alleviate in other deliberations.  Commuting costs are declining and there will be a reduction in energy costs because of the agreement with Iraq last weekend and fracking which has changed the energy scene.  It might, therefore, be possible not to knock down these estates and ensure these are places where people want to live.  The United Kingdom is debating the issue of high speed trains and what is regarded as wasted commuting time and it is proposed to provide Wi-Fi in order that train travelling time can become working time.  Perhaps commuting is less of a disutility than debt which is a major disutility.  People might trade houses to live further away on so-called ghost estates and this issue should be evaluated fully.<\/p><p>I congratulate Roddy Doyle on winning the novel of the year award and the other authors, John Banville and Michael Harding.

A total of 16 families a month are becoming homeless and there has been an 18% increase in the number seeking support, to 9,237 so far this year, which is 1,500 more than last year.  We are subject to a great deal of spinon how everything is turning around, green shoots, etc. but many people are in dire straits, particularly those who are finding it hard to keep a roof over their heads and meet their everyday bills.  We need to consider more constructive ways of supporting them.  A debate on the issue of homelessness is vital to allow us to put forward our thoughts on how this might be done.

Ahead of Focus Ireland's annual conference today, it highlighted an 18% increase in the number seeking support in the first ten months of the year.  More significantly, there has been a 50% increase in the number presenting as homeless in the greater Dublin area and a doubling of the number of families presenting as homeless.  The four organisations behind the MakeRoom campaign are seeking an end to long-term homelessness.  Threshold, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Simon have all reported an increase in the number presenting as homeless.  A recent report from the citizen information centres highlighted that one of the emerging issues was that the profile of those presenting as homeless, which would more typically have been single men and persons experiencing substance and alcohol abuse and so forth, had changed and that more families were presenting.<\/p> <p>That has changed and far more families are presenting as homeless.  The issue that is being highlighted by all of the organisations is that a housing problem is now influencing the number of people presenting as homeless.  From Threshold's access housing unit I am aware of the significant difficulty in finding proper accommodation for people who are homeless and getting them out of the situation they are in.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, on having protected the budget for homeless services this year, but the difficulty is that there are greater calls on the resource and a significant increase in the number of people presenting as homeless.

He was told he would be treated as a non-Irish citizen.  It seems outrageous that he would have to pay very high fees on the basis of being considered a non-EU citizen.  The same situation has occurred again.  I am sure it is an anomaly and that it was not the intention.  A man who lost his job three years ago went to the United Arab Emirates as he could not find work for his particular skill in this country.  His youngest daughter accompanied him.  She is now doing her leaving certificate in that country and has applied to go to university in Ireland.  She is being told she will be treated as non-EU citizen because she has lived abroad for three years.  The man in question had lived in Ireland all his life.  He went abroad three years ago when he lost his specialist job and his daughter is now being treated as a non-Irish citizen.  She was at school in Ireland in a Gaelscoil.  She is a fluent Irish speaker, as are her sisters and brothers.<\/p><p>When I checked out the matter the response I was given is that under the terms of the free fees initiative eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates and hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course.  The student in question has not been living in Ireland for three of the past five years.  Because of that, even though she is a fluent Irish speaker and, like all her sisters and brothers, grew up in Ireland and was at school here, she is being treated as someone who is not even an EU citizen.  I am sure that is an anomaly.  It should not apply to Irish citizens.  I am not sure where to go from here but it seems to me that the ruling should not apply and that it was not the intention that it would apply in such cases.  We must do something about it.  I urge the Leader to draw the case to the attention of the Department of Education and Skills or whoever it is that handles such matters.  I will supply him with all the details.  I am sure this case is an anomaly and that it can be solved, but it seems outrageous.

It will also cause the loss of between 400 and 500 jobs, between processing and fishing and will see a reduction in the north west, of approximately 23% in the number of fish that can be caught.  This will cost the economy in that area approximately &euro;1 million, not to mention the processing sector.<\/p><p>This issue was discussed yesterday at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was attended by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  We must all wear the Irish jersey, whether in opposition or government, and must put up as strong a case as possible against the Commission's proposal.  The Commission is trying to give concessions to Iceland and the Faroe Islands on the mackerel quota.  This is a disgraceful proposal on the part of the Commission.  Instead of implementing the trade sanctions it had been promising for over 18 months, it is now conceding and providing Iceland and the Faroe Islands with additional stock.  This is totally unacceptable and will wipe out a large proportion of the pelagic sector within our fishing industry.  This cannot be accepted.  If the Minister is available to come to the House ahead of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, we should avail of that opportunity.  However, I will not press that now.  The Minister, BIM and the Marine Institute need our support now.  We must work with each other to try to overcome the Commission's proposals.<\/p><p>I support Senator MacSharry in regard to the ongoing cuts in the health area.  One issue I find alarming and which I have experienced in my constituency concerns the letters individuals are receiving in respect of medical card reviews.  If the proposals go ahead, some 70,000 people will lose their medical cards.  In other words, the equivalent of the number of people it takes to fill Croke Park aged over 65, will lose their medical cards.  This is a huge number.  If there was an all-Ireland in Croke Park, we would be talking about the massive crowd.  The equivalent of that massive crowd will lose their medical cards as a result of the assessments taking place currently.   <\/p><p>There are massive difficulties across the health system and across various tiers within the health sector.  I would love to have a debate on hospital funding, the role of consultants and, most important, the medical card issue.  I fully support our health spokesperson, Senator MacSharry, who has been keeping this issue to the fore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700005#D00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1385549400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I support the call made by a number of Senators for a debate on homelessness.

I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, on this issue.  He answered a number of parliamentary questions over the past few months and has indicated to the Lower House that 14 GPs were called to heel on this issue, a number of whom were required to pay back the money charged to medical card patients.  However, evidence I have shows this practice is still going on.  Why does this problem persist when both the GP contract holders and the IMO have been informed this money should not be charged?  There is also a provision in the new contracts for GPs regarding this.  Why is it that some of the cases being investigated have not been brought to conclusion?  Will the money be returned to patients and how will that be done?<\/p><p>The relationship between GPs and patients is a special relationship and the fact patients are being charged incorrectly for blood tests puts a strain on that relationship.  It is difficult for patients to ask their GPs not to charge them or to ask for a refund.  We need a better system in place.  I suggest that notices be put up in all offices of GPs with State contracts to the effect that no charges will be made for blood tests.  This will help clarify the matter.  We need clarity on this issue as it has not gone away, despite the efforts made by the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700005#D00400","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1385549400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I would like to be associated with and wholeheartedly agree with the tributes and sentiments expressed regarding Fr.

Now that the banks are beginning to lend a little, people are getting more courageous and may be in a position to buy houses on offer at much reduced prices, there are opportunities that could help alleviate many of the housing problems experienced by people on low incomes and the homeless.  The increase in homeless numbers is a grave concern for all of us.<\/p><p>I welcome yesterday's significant announcement made by the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, that the national groundwater vulnerability map has been drawn up which aims to protect vital water supplies.  We all know how crucial water supply is.  This mapping project was undertaken over the past seven years by five geologists, recording information along 40,000 km of road and covering more than 50,000 km of area.  This will be used by local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, consultants and individuals to better understand and manage land use and development that has the potential to impact on groundwater supply.

Many of these were addressed yesterday.  There is no question that next year will be a challenging year in the health services.  They have funding of &euro;13.263 billion in current expenditure and &euro;397 million in capital expenditure for 2014 while savings, which have been outlined, amount to &euro;666 million.  There is a determination by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Minister for Health to ensure the budgets and savings are tightly monitored through 2014.  The goal, wherever possible, is to cut the costs of services rather than the level and quality of the services delivered, as well as accelerating the rate of reform in the sector.<\/p><p>That is easier said than done and it will be a very difficult task.  The HSE&rsquo;s annual service plan has been given to the Minister and he has a further 21 days until Monday, 16 December, to consider it.  I am sure the House will debate the plan when it is announced.  The Minister is working on this, unlike a former Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach who called the Department &quot;Angola&quot; and the party&rsquo;s current leader who ran out of it because he was knocked over by the many reports on it.  I am sure there will be plenty of debates on health over the coming months.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik inquired of the legislation to extend the university franchise for the Seanad.  There is no question of that legislation coming in before Christmas, as was suggested by some newspapers.  We will have it some time in the first half of next year.

I understand that ghost estate houses will not be demolished in areas where there is a demand for houses.

The most recent rough sleeper count conducted in April revealed 94 people sleeping rough in the Dublin area.  Figures from the November count will be available in the coming weeks.  Regardless of the number, the Government believes no one should need to sleep rough.  In the short term, the cold weather initiative operated by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, in partnership with voluntary organisations, has begun and will increase emergency bed level accommodation in the Dublin region.  At a more strategic level, the Government has set itself the goal of eliminating long-term homelessness by 2016.  As part of that policy, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing appointed an oversight group to review actions on homelessness and recommend actions that will assist in reaching the policy objective.  Work by the group is well advanced and its report will be published in several weeks.  There is an immediate short-term issue to ensure, particularly in winter, sufficient emergency accommodation available in the Dublin region.  This is a priority for Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and the voluntary organisations in partnership with it.  We must ensure there is a focus on the elimination of long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>Senator Sheahan asked when the Coroners Bill 2007 will be brought before the House.

Bernard McGlinchey was born in a different era and in the first year that &Eacute;amon de Valera led a Government into power, which is a coincidence as Fianna F&aacute;il political blood ran through his veins.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government had been in power for a number of years, but in 1932 Fianna F&aacute;il won the general election and a coalition Government was established.  Bernard McGlinchey was born a few short months after the formation of the first Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the State.<\/p><p>Bernard spent almost five decades as a member of Donegal County Council and Letterkenny Town Council, as well as 20 years as a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Bernard served in the ninth, tenth, 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th Seanaid between the years of 1961 and 1983.  Bernard was elected to Letterkenny Town Council in 1955 at the young age of 23, and he went on to run for Donegal County Council in 1961, when he was elected.  This showed that Bernard's contribution to both councils was significant, as the people re-elected him on each occasion.<\/p><p>As a businessman, he founded the Golden Grill nightclub in Letterkenny, but it was much more than that.  It was a place where people came together and where politics was done.  It was renowned in Donegal as being the Oireachtas of Donegal.  During his business days, Bernard provided much-needed local employment in Letterkenny.  Victor Fisher, who is a long serving member of Letterkenny Town Council, worked for Bernard McGlinchey down through the years, but cannot be here today.  In those days the country was going through a period of transformation and the disco era was coming to the fore.  Bernard was ahead of the curve in moving from the old dance hall entertainment venues into the new nightclub venues.  He was a visionary entrepreneur as well as a visionary public servant.  He was a member of the North-Western Health Board and he also served for a short period as a member of the Council of Europe.<\/p><p>He was a big and burly character, always smoking the pipe.  In most photographs of Bernard, the pipe is always to the fore.  His immense physical presence was matched with his oratorical power.  Bernard was a very strong political figure, not only in Donegal, but indeed nationally during some of the most turbulent political days the State has endured.  Bernard holds the record for the longest speech here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann during the marts Bill.  The record for the second longest speech is also held by Bernard McGlinchey, when he spoke for eight and a half hours on 18 May 1975 on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill 1975.  I wonder what the Leader would do if one of us tried to speak for that length of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700009#H00400","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1385551200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>He would never get it past the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700009#H00500","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1385551200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Last night I was looking at some speeches on the Oireachtas website going back to the 1970s, when Bernard McGlinchey's contributions were being made in the House.  On one occasion, when Fianna F&aacute;il were in opposition, there was a confrontation with the then Leas-Chathaoirleach and Bernard was asked to leave the Chamber.  A vote was taken and passed, but Bernard still would not leave the Chamber.  He said that the only way he would leave the Chamber was by being carried out.  That shows his determination.  He did not want to let the people of Donegal down.  He wanted to make sure his voice was heard, but suffice to say that he did leave the Chamber.  He was a passionate, determined, energetic, loyal member of Fianna F&aacute;il, and it is only right that we pay respect to his contribution today.<\/p><p>He was also a great community man and above all, was most at home in his native Letterkenny.  His huge contribution to the development of Donegal's primary town is there today for all to see.  He was deeply involved in the development of Letterkenny General Hospital and Letterkenny Institute of Technology in the 1970s, the decentralisation of the initial part of the social welfare office to Letterkenny, and the acquisition of land beside St. Conal's Hospital for a town park, which opened in 1999 and is justifiably named as Bernard McGlinchey Park.<\/p><p>Bernard was an exceptionally determined and dedicated public representative, who was always available to meet constituents, individuals, families and any community group or organisation in County Donegal and nationally.  His life's labours are now at a close.  His final resting place is in Conwal on the Church Hill Road, a few miles outside his beloved Letterkenny.  The political battles and the arguments have faded into memory, and he had quite a few of those during his lifetime, being here during the arms trial.  He engaged in negotiations at that time in Donegal and at a national level.  He steered Clement Coughlan to victory in a by-election in Donegal in 1980, and had it not been for his contribution at that time, many people say that Clement Coughlan's victory may not have been as fruitful as it was.<\/p> <p>His contribution to Donegal politics and national politics makes us all proud to have known Bernard McGlinchey.<\/p><p>The legacy of men and women like him is their fundamental guiding commitment to public service.

As others have said, he was a long-serving Senator for Fianna F&aacute;il and served from 1961 to 1982.  I did not know him.  I know, having listened to the tributes paid to him and reading some of his obituaries, that he was a legend in Letterkenny and Donegal.  He was very well established in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the county.  He was also a Senator who served over different periods, both as an elected member and as a Taoiseach's nominee.  He had a very long career in the Seanad and other Senators have spoken of some of his work in the Seanad.  The point that stood out in his obituaries is his record for speaking for 12 hours on the marts Bill.  It is an extraordinary achievement by any standard and certainly by today's standards.  I am glad that nobody has tried to beat his record during the current session of the Seanad.<\/p><p>On a serious note, I extend condolences and sympathies, on behalf of the Labour Party group, to his family and wide circle of friends and connections in Donegal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700010#J00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1385551800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I have known Bernard McGlinchey all of my life and since I was born.  Today it is my greatest political privilege, since my election in 2002, to pay tribute to him.  To me and many people in the north west, particularly in Donegal, he was a giant of political life.  As I have said, I have known him since I was born.  He used to kid me many years ago by saying \"I changed your nappy.\"  With respect to him, I doubt that he changed many nappies and I am not sure that he changed mine.<\/p><p>Bernard had a fantastic career over the years, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has eloquently expressed.  His contribution is simply second to none in the context of delivery for the north west of the country on issues such as health and the national question.  His contribution to debates ensured that the needs of his part of the country were looked after.  To this day we still debate the need to have equality of access to services and so on but Bernard McGlinchey and others were the pioneers in that area.<\/p><p>My father, Ray MacSharry, was in the D&aacute;il at the same time Bernard was in the Seanad and they shared a house.  Over the years many members of the Houses have stayed in a house on Clareville Road in Harold's Cross.  Bernard McGlinchey always made sure that if there was anything on offer, through the various Ministers who shared the same lodgings, Donegal and the north west got its fair share.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has rightly pointed out that Letterkenny General Hospital, Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the Department of Social Welfare offices are all part of Bernard McGlinchey's legacy.  It is rare to see political acknowledgment from the Opposition, one's colleagues and so on with a tribute being paid by way of naming a street or park after a person.  He worked so hard to provide a park in Letterkenny.  It is great credit to Bernard McGlinchey that the park has been named after him with the agreement of all political colleagues on all sides.  It represents a small example and testament to a lifetime of effective representation and delivery for all people who sought his help, and as I said in particular, throughout the country. <\/p><p>His contribution locally will always be remembered.  His contribution nationally needs to be drawn upon because he brought his business acumen to debates here in the Oireachtas.  Sadly, that business acumen is lacking today because there is a lack of entrepreneurial spirit and a can-do attitude.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill highlighted the fact that Bernard was ahead of the curve in his entertainment business.  He brought that knowledge and approach to the Oireachtas and debates over the years.<\/p><p>Bernard made an impact internationally because he served with distinction on the Council of Europe.  He brought the same spirit of looking after the people of north-west region of the island and his entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude to the forum.<\/p><p>On a personal level, I have spent all of my childhood holidays with Bernard McGlinchey.  I learned to walk and talk, on consecutive summers, in his house on Rutland Island that is located off the coast of Donegal.  Bernard had a great love of the sea and boating.  Once upon a time he almost lost his life through a boating accident.  His boat sank and he had to take refuge on a nearby rock until somebody, thankfully, rescued him.  <\/p><p>My family and I are grateful to have experienced his generosity first hand over the past 40 years and his generosity was second to none.  Earlier Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned Bernard's long political career on the council which lasted from 1955 to 2004.  Only great Chinese leaders have managed to effectively serve for such long periods.  <\/p><p>From a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, I had the pleasure of chairing a convention in Letterkenny in 2004.  It was his last political outing.  I shall never forget the evening because it was more a tribute, like today is, to his great achievements than a convention to select candidates.  Over 400 people sat in awe of him and had respect for him but he simply stood up and thanked them all.  He said that he could see all of them and would never forget the many people who helped him over the years and, in jest, said that he would never forget the people who did not help him.  He was truly a great man.<\/p><p>I recall one occasion in 1999 where he replied, in jest, when an opposition councillor joked, following Bernard's announcement that he might not run for election and would put up his feet because he had served for so long.  The councillor, perhaps in jest, said that retiring was the only positive contribution that Bernard had made.  Bernard changed his mind about retiring and went on to top the poll thus ensuring that the councillor did not get across the line.  There are famous comebacks but that was a particularly famous one.  To many of us in the north-west of Ireland, particularly the people of Donegal, and like the great Muhammad Ali, Bernard will always be the greatest.  <\/p><p>I conclude by extending my sympathies to Kathleen Sweeney, his partner of many years, whom he loved dearly.  She was so important in his life.  I also extend sympathies to his family, his sons Paul and Ray, his daughters Adrienne, Karen and Dolores, and his wife, Liz.  We extend all of our sympathies to them because none will miss him more than them.  I will miss him, along with my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  I know that the council and political colleagues of Fianna F&aacute;il throughout Donegal and the north west will miss him too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700010#J00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1385551800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party I join in the condolences offered to Bernard's family and friends and join in the glowing tributes paid to him today.<\/p> <p>It is impossible for me to follow his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues who have spoken very eloquently and passionately about his achievements as an individual and politician.  I did not know him personally but have heard him described several times over the past 24 hours as \"a one-off individual\".  He worked tirelessly for the people of his native county.  He was a politician of high calibre and a true representative of the people.  I am sure the people of Donegal, surrounding counties and Ireland as a whole will remember him for all the positive things he did for his county and what he brought to national politics.  One does not get re-elected to any chamber or institution time and again unless one has a proven track record and has worked hard and delivered for one's constituents.  That Bernard got re-elected and topped the poll on numerous occasions demonstrates his calibre and the esteem in which he was held.<\/p><p>Bernard made a national contribution as a Member of the Seanad.

Like Senator Cullinane, I did not know him but, having heard the moving accounts of him by Senators Mac Sharry and &Oacute; Domhnaill, I believe we got to know him a little better.  He was born in 1932 in a county which, as we know, is only barely attached to the rest of this State by the three or four miles of territory between Budoran and Ballyshannon.  The county was often neglected and experienced very strong emigration to Scotland on the Derry boat.  In the late 1930s, there were petitions by thousands of people in Donegal asking to leave the State because they had become so disillusioned.  I have heard the historian &Eacute;amon Phoenix talk about the last petition, which was in 1937.  The Border runs down the middle of the area between the four churches in the small town of Pettigo.  Two of the churches are in Fermanagh and two are in Donegal.  Donegal was so remote from the rest of the State that it needed a champion in Bernard McGlinchey.  By all accounts, it got a champion in him, and that is why the park is called after him.  One must acknowledge his role in having the Department of Social Protection offices located there, in addition to his role in respect of Letterkenny General Hospital and the regional technical college, which later became the institute of technology, a noted part of the infrastructure.<\/p><p>Donegal is a unique county in which three languages are spoken, namely Irish, English and a strong Ulster Scots.

At times it was a political battleground, but it was also a political nursery and political generator during those years in which Bernard McGlinchey actually served there.  For perhaps 20 or 25 years, Donegal was a minuscule version of the political landscape that then existed.  I am thinking what a very easy time the Leader has with us now by comparison with those turbulent times.  I was wondering how successful we might be if we tried to speak for 12 minutes.  The Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach would have a say in that.  There is a message in the strategy of filibustering, or otherwise, that existed in the time of Bernard McGlinchey.  It is mind-boggling to think that somebody could get up and speak for 12 hours.  One wonders how Bernard managed without food, water and so on.  It is an indication of the passion that existed in public life.  That is why I am very pleased with the tradition and custom we have of paying tribute to those who have gone before us.<\/p><p>In all the time that I have sat here to listen to tributes, I never heard an acrimonious word coming from the political opponents of the deceased.  It has always been a matter of leaving partisanship to one side and making an effort in a nice, sincere and genuine way to recall the attributes of the deceased colleague.  When Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann was held in Buncrana on four occasions, I had reason to realise how successful Bernard McGlinchey was in delivering what was required at any given time.  There is no doubt but that he was a master when it came to oiling the wheels of the local services and community.  Reference has been made to Bernard's entrepreneurship.  Let us be fair about it: back in those days, that was the way in which to create jobs.  It was not always a question of big industries coming into the country or of expecting that the Government could do something; the work had to be done by oneself.  We are all well aware that no matter how successful chambers of commerce might be or how dedicated local trade committees might be, it is always left to one person to put his head above the parapet, put his money where his mouth is, take the risks and try to create jobs.  Bernard McGlinchey did so in so many different ways.<\/p><p>We should not skirt around the turbulent times that existed in Northern Ireland and the role that was played by so many people.  It was played sincerely, very often from a different perspective.  However, there is no doubt but that Bernard McGlinchey was always part of that drama and story.  Bernard was a proud Donegal man but also a proud Ulsterman.  There is no doubt that if one wanted to be a proactive public representative, one had no choice but to be part of the drama, find solutions and promote peace and justice.  It was not always easy because of so many agendas operating at one time.  Anybody who knew Bernard would say that what one saw was what one got.  I always said the same about Ian Paisley.  There was no doubt about what Ian Paisley felt because he said what he felt, irrespective of whether one agreed.<\/p><p>Bernard McGlinchey was very much an iconic figure.  He was never too far away from headlines and was always present to express a view.  However, that he could enter public life in his 20s, serve for so long in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and offer such sterling service to his county must be noted.<\/p> <p>It is often said that we in political life are too parochial.  I do not agree.  It is like building a house where what happens in one's constituency is one of the blocks, and if that block is not strong, the foundation is not strong.  For any of those in Donegal I have read about, met or heard about, Donegal was their focus.  As a result, they also gave ideas to other counties.<\/p><p>The late Bernard McGlinchey was very much part of this story and it is nice for us to be able to say, to his family, extended family, colleagues, all who worked with him and all who still have him in their folk memory, he was shared with the whole nation and it all was not confined to Donegal.  Some names crop up in all discussions and when we are reminiscing in years to come, no doubt the late Bernard McGlinchey's name will always be central to any reminiscence, appreciation or acknowledgement which takes place.<\/p><p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700011#K00300","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385553000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few brief words in memory of the late iar Sheanad&oacute;ir Bernard McGlinchey and in doing so, to express my personal sympathy to his wife, Liz, and his family, and to his partner and friend for many years, Ms Kathleen Sweeney.<\/p><p>  Unlike Senator MacSharry, I did not know the late Senator McGlinchey well.  I had heard of him through Fianna F&aacute;il folklore but I only got to meet and know him when I became a member of the General Council of County Councils in 1999.  I struck up a great relationship with him from that time onwards.  In fact, he was instrumental in me deciding to run for the Seanad and advised me well, and helped me campaign in my first election in 2002.<\/p><p>  As colleagues have said, he was a Member of this House for 20 years, from 1961 until 1982, and a public representative at local level in his native Donegal for almost five decades.  He was a proud Donegal man and a proud Irishman but he was, in particular, extremely proud of his native town of Letterkenny where he established a successful business.  Indeed, the town of Letterkenny is littered with monuments, such as the general hospital, the Department of Social Protection offices and the institute of technology, to the memory, work and dedication to the town of the late Bernard McGlinchey.  As colleagues pointed out, the public park in Letterkenny, for which he was instrumental in obtaining the land, was named the Bernard McGlinchey Town Park after him.  It is a unique honour that his colleagues, from all parts of the political divide and none, decided to name that park in his memory while he was still living.  Indeed, he told me it is a park he used stroll around from time to time and sit down in to have a quite smoke.<\/p><p>  The 12 hour debate has been alluded to by the Leader and other colleagues.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; wondered how he managed without food and water for those 12 hours.  The food and water, knowing the late Bernard McGlinchey as I knew him, would not have mattered to him, but it was quite obvious that one was able to smoke in the Chamber in those days because he could not have gone for 12 hours without having a puff out of his pipe.  I would be interested in checking if smoking was allowed in the Chamber at that time.  I suggest it definitely was.<\/p><p>  The late Bernard, as has been stated by previous speakers, was not only a proud Donegal man and Irishman, but a proud member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and was very friendly with and supporter of the late former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, down through the decades through thick and thin.  Mr. Pat 'The Cope' Gallagher MEP, in a contribution on economic affairs in this House some time shortly after the death of Bernard, summed the man up well when he stated:<blockquote>  Bernard McGlinchey was an honest, generous and decent man who was always available to assist politicians, individuals, families and communities throughout the length and breadth of Donegal and further afield. ...

I particularly remember one occasion, I think, during the 1997 Seanad campaign, having to travel to Donegal.  Going to Donegal, for somebody from west Cork, was like going to Scotland.  It was a different country.  One felt exiled there, particularly looking for Seanad votes.  He allowed me address the gathering.  He ruled the Donegal council with an iron fist and on the day of the voting, he would call together all the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and those aligned to Fianna F&aacute;il and, with an iron fist, dictate who they should vote for.  That is why on the last occasion, on the panel that I ran in, I had difficulty even getting beyond Sligo.  On the earlier occasion, he called me aside as we were leaving.  He was very loyal to a particular Seanad&oacute;ir at the time who was an acting whip on one occasion, the late Senator Paddy McGowan.  He would have known of me having run for the D&aacute;il and being in the Seanad.  He said that he greatly feared the late Senator Paddy McGowan would be short a vote or two, and he encouraged me to help out his good colleague as best I could.  He said - this is the first time I had come across this - that he would give me a vote on the panel, which was not the one I was recently elected on, and I would know it because he would use a green marker and Roman numerals.  He said I would be getting the No. 1 and told me who would get the No. 2 and No. 3.  I was astonished that at the count, where they slowly put out the papers, I was able to recognise the green marker and that he had honoured his commitment to me.  It was an unusual technique.  He was an established politician, obviously, revered in Donegal.  One certainly would be <i>persona non grata<\/i> canvassing in Donegal on any panel if one had not some rapport with the late great Bernard McGlinchey.  He will be sadly missed.<\/p><p>  As Leas-Chathaoirleach, I convey my sympathy to all his political colleagues of all dimensions, particularly in Donegal, across the board, and to his family, and particularly the people of Donegal he represented loyally for so long.  I offer my sincere sympathy to all concerned.  At this juncture, it would be appropriate that I would ask the Members to stand for a minute's silence.

Last week we completed Report Stage in the D&aacute;il where the Bill was the subject of some intense and lively debate.  In the course of the various Stages in the D&aacute;il a number of amendments were made and the version before the House constitutes strong and comprehensive legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill is the legislative element of one of the Government's largest public service reform initiatives.  More importantly, it is the most ambitious and comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken.  The need for change is undeniable, as shown by nearly 20 major reports in the past 30 years on child protection failings, most recently last year's report of the independent child death review group.  Stark findings have emerged of service dysfunction and fragmentation and a lack of inter-agency working.  Recent inspections by the Health Information and Quality Authority and last month's pilot phase report on the national audit of neglect demonstrate that structural and systemic deficits and inconsistencies remain in services.<\/p><p>If one wishes to make improvements to a system, one must first identify what are its failings and outstanding issues and which of its elements are operating successfully.  The HIQA reports on child protection services are providing such information on a frequent basis.  For this reason, I welcome the agency's reports on child protection services, fostering and residential services.  A consistent feature of the reports is that dedicated staff went above and beyond the call of duty.  However, they have also found that some staff fell far short.  While some geographical regions were excellent in how they operated, others required significant improvement.  Similarly, while many legislative and financial supports were found to be robust, some were treated as purely aspirational.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that serious gaps persist in basic data for children in care, referrals and service provision generally.  These gaps are being addressed and the country has become data rich in respect of children.  I have just returned from the launch of the Growing Up in Ireland survey which examines the position of five year old children.  It is encouraging to note how well these children have made the transition into primary school.  While specific issues such as obesity need to be addressed and the past five years have been tough on families, it is to the credit of families and parents that the country's five year old children are doing well, as the study found.  <\/p><p>The identification of systemic gaps related to the safety, protection and well-being of the nation's children was a call to arms for the Government that could not be ignored.  The need for change gave rise to the establishment of the first dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs and a requirement to establish a body such as the Child and Family Agency.<\/p> <p>The need for change gave rise to the establishment of the first dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs and it gives rise to the need to establish a body such as the child and family agency.  In order to do things differently, we must proactively identify and correct our failures.  Since taking up my position as Minister, I have introduced the new Children First national guidelines and overseen the Children First implementation framework.  I recently secured Cabinet approval for the publication of sectoral implementation plans.  This is important because it means that every Department is responsible for implementing Children First.  Representatives from Departments work together to share what they are doing in their respective areas.  This has been done in advance of the legislation so that we are well prepared once it is in place.  We have introduced the first ever national standards for child protection services and an independent inspection regime under HIQA.  This new standards-led approach is central to fostering a new culture of transparency, accountability and effectiveness.  We have recruited additional social workers, although we need more.  We have a young workforce, and the retention of social workers is a big issue in this country and every other European country.  We can retain front-line social workers and staff by giving them support and better training for their challenging work.  <\/p><p>We are designing new models for assessment and referral to ensure that young children who have been sexually abused get the response they require when they present to services.  They have to be seen as a priority, as do cases of child protection and serious neglect.  Gordon Jeyes is reorganising care services so that they respond in a timely and effective manner to those who need them.  We are implementing new models for data management and performance monitoring.  We have seen the publication by the HSE children and family service of the very useful child welfare and protection practice handbook.  We have arranged training sessions around the country whereby those who work in the field of child protection can examine in detail the handbook and the Children First guidelines.  The main message that emanates from these sessions is on the need for inter-agency co-operation and partnership.  GPs need to be good partners with child protection teams, which in turn need to work with local schools, so that when a referral is made ongoing exchanges of information and support form part of the response.  We are emancipating our child protection and welfare services from the monolith of the health service, where for too long in the past they were lost and effectively rudderless.  Inter-agency co-operation will be a big part of the way forward.  We need more integration of policy and services so that we do better for children and families.  In 2011 I established a task force of dedicated expert volunteers chaired by the very able Ms. Maureen Lynott to advise me on the establishment of the new agency.  The task force examined international best practice and made recommendations on the development of the agency.<\/p><p>The task force report referred to the once-in-a-generation opportunity to fundamentally reform children's services in Ireland.  The Bill I am now presenting seeks to make that opportunity a reality.  It provides the organisational context, leadership focus and accountability within which real improvements in child and family services can be achieved.  I do not pretend this will happen overnight.  It is an ongoing challenge, but we are putting the building blocks in place.  Just as the creation of my Department brought child-related policy out of the shadow of the Department of Health and into the direct light of ministerial, Cabinet and public scrutiny, this legislation will once and for all move the services for children and families into the light of day.  Put simply, we are moving from a position in which child and family welfare was barely a priority to one in which it is the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, overseen by a dedicated Department.  I pay tribute to all the workers who have laboured on the front lines over the years to deliver effective services to families.  I recognise the need for continuity as well, to make the best of our new start.<\/p><p>In bringing the Bill before the House, I am delivering a key commitment in the programme for Government and something that has been a priority for me as Minister.  I thank all the staff who have been involved in the preparation of the Bill.  A considerable amount of work has already been undertaken on the logistical, organisational and financial management aspects of the establishment of and transition to the new agency.  With 4,000 staff transferring, Senators will understand that more work remains to be done.  We have recruited a new management team led by CEO designate Gordon Jeyes and are setting up a transitional board chaired by Ms. Norah Gibbons.<\/p><p>The Bill seeks to facilitate each of the distinct elements that make up the programme for Government commitment through the creation of an agency which is solely and exclusively dedicated to children and families, has an improved range of services to meet the needs of children and families and is subject to best practice in the discharge of its accountability to the Government and the Oireachtas.  The establishment a dedicated agency recognises that the complex operational management and reform of child welfare and protection services has jostled with many other competing objectives within the large and demanding health and personal social service arena.  The Bill provides a mandate to a dedicated agency to lead the improvement of children's services.  It will allow for the development of expertise and support for professionals in delivering some of the most complex interventions the State is charged with undertaking.  The Bill provides for the Child and Family Agency to assume responsibility for a range of services from establishment day.  These services include child welfare and protection services, family support responsibilities and National Educational Welfare Board responsibilities.  It is extremely important that educational welfare services are included because serious non-attendance is often the first sign that a child is in trouble.  We need to be proactive in responding to non-attendance.  The agency will also assume responsibility for preschool inspection services, in which regard Senators will be familiar with the work I am doing on the preschool quality agenda; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services - we have a long way to go to ensure we have the kind of service that can react effectively and quickly to children and women who face violence; and services related to the psychological welfare of children.  We decided it was important that psychologists work with the agency so that front-line interventions can draw on psychological expertise.  One of the recommendations from the reports prepared in recent months is that we need better assessment of children's needs at the point of intake.<\/p><p>This is a major public service reform involving 4,000 staff across three existing agencies and a budget of nearly &euro;600 million.  The children and family services transferring from the HSE include the full range of family support and child welfare services, child protection, foster care, residential care, after-care and adoption services.  They include responsibility for some of our most vulnerable children, many of whom are doing extremely well.  There are very good statistics on how children in care are doing in the education system.  The vast majority of them are in full-time education.  We will also have responsibility for the more than 1,500 young people who are getting after-care services and will also be responding to nearly 40,000 child protection and welfare referrals every year.  The incorporation of preschool inspection services will further promote a nationally consistent approach to regulation, inspection and enforcement, all of which are key elements of my Department's ongoing preschool quality agenda.  The transfer of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services from the HSE is important in equipping the agency to provide an integrated service to vulnerable families.  Support to victims and groups working with those experiencing such violence, including rape crisis centres and refuges, will in future be the responsibility of the child and family agency.  The HSE will retain responsibility for the sexual assault treatment units which are located in acute hospitals and other medical facilities.<\/p><p>While improving child protection is a key priority for us, it is my firm belief - which I am sure is shared by the Senators in this room, who have a lot of experience of working with families - that early intervention is the key.  In this regard, I am delighted that I was able to announce the area-based childhood, ABC, programme, through which the Government is investing &euro;30 million in working with families in certain areas.<\/p> <p>It is based on the successful model of prevention and early intervention programmes funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, and that organisation has made a further contribution of &euro;14 million, which the Government has matched.  Therefore, we have almost &euro;30 million available for such investment.  Such an early intervention programme should make a big difference throughout the country and as time progresses we should be able to mainstream adolescents from that programme.<\/p><p> The pilot phase report of the national audit of neglect cases has also highlighted, as I said, the harsh reality of neglect.<i><\/i>Parental alcohol misuse was a factor in 62% of families in the overall sample.  That study has highlighted for us again that family dysfunction is often associated with chronic alcohol and drug misuse.  We should make it a priority to have a very appropriate response to alcohol issues in this country; to be very clear that we do not want to see young children being exposed to inappropriate branding; to make sure that those working in the adult services with adults who have alcohol and addiction problems take account of the needs of children in those families; and to ensure that we make the right decisions for all of those children.  It is important that universal, easily accessible services within the community work to promote good outcomes for children, including child welfare, and that they have a clear role in supporting child development and family functioning while always being vigilant and responsive to child protection issues.  We need strong linkages between universal and specialist services.  I have written into the agency Bill that prevention work will be supported by the agency and that family support is a key element of its work.<\/p><p> Much work is under way on the development of new models of case intake, assessment and referral, to include both a greater differentiation between child protection and welfare referrals and a greater focus on early intervention.  We have got to get the balance right.  Clearly, many crisis cases are coming forward, but if we do not do the early intervention work and provide support to families more crisis cases will arise.  It is a catch-22 in that we have to do both to be effective.<\/p><p> Building on this work, the Bill provides for a much expanded range of services compared to that currently delivered within HSE child welfare and protection services.  It provides for the delivery of psychological services to children and families and they will be part of the specialist support.<\/p><p> The Bill provides that the staff of the Family Support Agency, previously a separate agency, will transfer to the child and family agency on its establishment.  The functions that agency is currently discharging, with the exception of family mediation, will transfer to the new agency.  These include providing family support, relationship counselling, supporting and developing the family and community resource centres, which are all very important.  The new agency will build on the work that the Family Support Agency has done over a long period and the work of the nationwide network of 106 family resource centres.  The Family Support Agency also funds more than 600 voluntary and community organisations.  The inclusion of those services will ensure that the ethos of the child and family agency is built upon partnership with communities.  I want to reiterate that commitment today.<\/p><p> We have to take account of the impact of poverty, which I have gone into that in some detail in the my speech.  Job creation and lifting people out of poverty will be a key element in helping families to deal with the severe economic difficulties of the past few years.  The announcement yesterday of the type of job creation we are seeing is important for the families we are talking about.  A job is certainly the best way out of poverty.<\/p><p> The Bill also provides that all the functions and staff of the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, will transfer to the child and family agency on its establishment.  I have said that the educational focus is important and that should be maintained and developed.  The agency's educational welfare responsibilities are set out in statute and we must ensure that they have very high visibility in the work of the agency.  <\/p><p> I have agreed with Government colleagues to explore the scope for further extending the responsibilities of the child and family agency after it successfully commences operations.  In any event, given the breadth of services provided to children, there will be an ongoing requirement for the agency to develop very strong partnerships with key agencies in the education, health, justice, local government and other sectors, and to continue relationships and partnerships with HSE staff, as in the case of, for example, public heath nurses.  We have to make sure that those linkages continue. <\/p><p> The programme for Government commits to improving accountability.  This reflects concerns regarding the transparency and openness of the child welfare and protection services.  We have taken initial steps in this regard and we want to make sure that we have greater service delivery consistently, role clarity in performance management and stronger partnerships with voluntary agencies.  Gordon Jeyes has done a good deal of work on this to ensure that he develops those partnerships with the voluntary organisations, that service level agreements are, and continue, to be worked out with the voluntary organisations and that everybody can have a focus on what their priorities are.  We need to have joined-up thinking between the voluntary and statutory organisations in order to meet the many needs that exist.<\/p><p> The task force undertook a very detailed review of governance models both nationally and internationally and devised recommendations to assist in achieving good governance and accountability in the particular context applying to children's services and this agency.  The proposed sections of the Bill reflect these recommendations and a range of specific legislative proposals have been included to introduce a new model of public accountability and responsiveness on behalf of the agency.  I have listed those on page 12 of my speech.  They include control of the allocation of funding to the agency through the Vote of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in order that financial allocations underpin Government priorities; the multi-annual performance framework for the agency, which sets out key priorities and the key policy, resource and governance considerations; and a performance statement for the agency each year outlining what the priorities will be and the resources and key Government targets that apply.  These will be extremely helpful in ensuring that the agency remains on target in terms of the work it must do.  The Minister will proactively articulate the Government's requirements and enter into dialogue with the agency as to how these priorities can be achieved.<b><\/b><\/p><p> I would like to draw the attention of Members to the provisions in the Bill related to the best interests and views of the child. These are ground-breaking ones in many ways.  They fully meet the wording that was put before the people last year in the children's referendum and go beyond it in some important respects.<\/p><p> The specific requirements for the agency to perform its functions with regard to the Child Care Act and the Adoption Act accords with the provisions set out in the children's referendum.  I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il to broaden the operation of this section to provide that when performing particular functions in respect of an individual child under other specified Acts - not just the Child Care Act and the Adoption Act - the agency will seek to get views of the child and give them due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.   At individual level it would be good practice to obtain the views of the young person, and it is what we should expect of our service providers, but this amendment will give statutory expression to good practice.<\/p><p> The Bill contains additional requirements across a broader range of functions relating to children and families.  The agency will have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters and will ensure that consideration is given to the views of child as part of any consultation process in which the agency is involved.  The Bill advances these important key principles, on which we had a great deal of discussion last year when discussing the children's referendum.  In that context, it applied to the legal situations in which children found themselves, and obviously there are some legal issues outstanding in that regard.<\/p><p> There are 97 sections contained in 13 Parts and three Schedules to the Bill.  I do not intend to go into detail on each one of those, but no doubt they will be covered in the course of our discussion.  Section 1 covers the Title.  Section 2 is important in that it defines the key terms in the Bill.  There are a number of other provisions and I will not go through them in detail.<b><\/b>Part 2 covers the child and family agency in section 6 to 18.  Section 6 provides for the making of an order by the Minister in respect of an establishment day for the agency.  I would like to thank Senators for facilitating the debate in the House today and the taking of Committee and Report Stages in the next few weeks.  Section 7 provides for the establishment of the agency on establishment day.  I refer the Members to section 8, which is an important one that provides for the functions of the agency.  I engaged in a good deal of discussion on this during the course of the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il.  Section 9 provides for the agency to have regard to the best interests and views of the child when making decisions and planning and reviewing the provision of services.  Section 10 provides that the functions of the agency may be performed by a public body by agreement between the public body and the agency.  It provides for a reciprocal arrangement between the public body and the agency by agreement.  This is very relevant to a child and family agency because it enables many providers to deliver the services that are needed.<\/p> <p>There is a good history of working with voluntary organisations such as Barnardos and the ISPCC which work in this area.<\/p><p>Section 14 will oblige the agency to furnish information to the Minister which he or she is likely to consider significant for the performance of his or her functions or which has been specified by the Minister as falling within a class of developments of public interest or concern.  This is about good information.  It was difficult at one stage to obtain documentation and data from the HSE.  Section 15 empowers the Minister to require the agency to furnish certain information or documents where he or she considers it necessary in the public interest to do so for the performance of his or her functions.  Section 16 enables the Minister to share certain information or documents with the agency.<\/p><p>Section 19 provides for the composition of the board of the agency.  I have appointed Norah Gibbons as chairperson of the interim board and a range of representatives who have good experience in the sector and in human resources, governance, finance and public accountability.  The board will transition to being the board of the agency once it is established.<\/p><p>Part 3 deals with the duties and responsibilities of the board.  Part 4 deals with the functions of the chief executive officer.  It covers the delegation and sub-delegation of functions by the agency to the chief executive officer.  It provides for everything one would expect in terms of the good governance of such a major organisation.<\/p><p>Part 5 addresses standards and qualifications.  Section 36 provides for the maintenance of proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest by specified persons performing functions under the Bill.  This Part also provides for clear recommendations and codes of conduct.<\/p><p>Part 6 covers accountability and the funding of the agency. <\/p><p>Part 7 deals with provisions relating to employees and advisers, while Part 8 address the provision of services.  Section 56 enables the agency, subject to certain matters, including the resources available to it, to enter into arrangements with not-for-profit service providers for the provision of child and family services.  The other sections in this Part are necessary for an agency of this size and clarify the governance and accountability measures that need to be in place for such an agency. <\/p><p>Sections 60 to 70, inclusive, in Part 9 provide for complaints, while Part 10, sections 71 to 81, inclusive, deal with the dissolution of the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board on establishment day.  This will allow the important functions in which they are engaged to transition to the new agency.  Part 11 outlines how the staff make that transfer and how their rights, terms and conditions, tenure of office and remuneration will be protected following the transfer.  An intensive human resources process has been ongoing for approximately a year and a half with the staff and we have received great support from those who are transferring.  I thank all those involved in the process because this is about change for people who are moving employment from the HSE to the new agency.  It has been responded to well by all who have been involved.  I thank the unions, employers and staff who have engaged in the process.  They got on with the work in a private way to make sure the agency could be established.  I express my gratitude to them for the serious way in which they have done the work and its success, as evidenced by the fact that every staff member who is transferring was informed of the transition several months ago and some of the complexities that inevitably arise from such a transfer have been worked out.  This Part also provides for the transfer of certain staff functions from the HSE to the agency.<\/p><p>Part 12 deals with the amendment of the Child Care Act 1992.  Under section 92, a new Part is being inserted into the Child Care Act 1991.  I have taken the opportunity to use the legislation to deal with issues relating to the early years sector which have been highlighted in recent months by &quot;Prime Time&quot; and which clearly needed to be addressed.  The section provides for the registration of early years service providers, minimum qualifications for those working in the early years sector, enforcement of standards in early years services and increased penalties on conviction for breaches of statutory provisions.  Sections 93 to 97, inclusive, deal with miscellaneous provisions relating to the continuation of appointments, designations and authorisations under various statutes where the person held the appointment immediately before enactment.  Much of this is technical to make sure we have continuity when people transfer from one agency to another.<\/p><p>I hope that gives Members a sense of the philosophy behind the setting up of the agency, the services it will provide, the transfer, governance and accountability.  I thank Members, many of whom are supportive of the principle of establishing a new agency, and look forward to the debate on the detail of the legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700013#N00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385555100,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on bringing forward the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes and, in principle, supports this long delayed and much promised legislation which formally establishes the Child and Family Agency.  However, the Bill seems to be more about the agency than the child, with the functions of the agency and the best interests of the child occupying two sections, whereas eight sections are devoted to the agency's chief executive officer.  The establishment of the agency is meant to address the issue of fragmentation in child services. I fully support that objective.  The Bill also seeks to put in place clear lines of accountability in decision-making.  The agency in its day-to-day operations will be independent of the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, while the Minister will be responsible for policy making.  Curiously, the same rationale was used in the creation of the HSE, an agency the Government plans to abolish.<\/p><p>We have concerns a the number of services that the task force on the establishment of the new agency recommended to be included have not been followed up on by the Minister.  Nonetheless, there is no doubt that under the HSE services for children did not receive the attention they deserved and the establishment of the agency which has the child at the forefront of its concerns is to be greatly welcomed.  During the years the State did not cherish its children well and the different reports on the way they were treated in residential institutions highlighted how much of a scandal and a shame it was.  We are endeavouring to rectify this, but it will never be rectified for those who suffered, whether in the Magdalen laundries or residential institutions run by different agencies acting on behalf of the State.  The recent film reproductions on what had happened were upsetting as we witnessed how children had been treated by the State.  We failed them and it is about time this agency was created.  It is a step in the right direction, which is why we support it.<\/p><p>It is sometimes forgotten that when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, we took action.  In 2011 the Minister announced the publication of a new national children's strategy for the period 2012 to 2017 to give an opportunity to set out a clear road map for the next five years.  During our period in office the introduction of the free preschool year was worthwhile and the Minister hopes to introduce a second free preschool year.  The current provision is available to all eligible children in the year prior to commencing primary school.<\/p> <p>The scheme has been hugely successful with approximately 95% of children availing of the free preschool provision in the year prior to attending school.  There has been a major step forward in preschool education.  From meeting children who have gone through the system I can say it gives them great confidence when starting primary school.  It certainly makes the first days at school much easier as children have built up friendships in preschool.  I know it is the Minister's wish to add a second preschool year but that is difficult due to existing financial constraints.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  However, I commend her on retaining the free preschool year.  I presume it might have come under pressure during the budgetary discussions but the Minister fought for it and succeeded in retaining it.<\/p><p>For the first time in Irish history, we established both an Office of the Minister for Children and a Minister for children.  I accept that the Taoiseach elevated the position to a full Cabinet Ministry but previously the Minister of State sat at the Cabinet table.  Key Government officials were brought together in the Office of the Minister for Children to work in a co-ordinated and integrated way.  The late Brian Lenihan launched the first overarching Government policy to guide the delivery of all children&rsquo;s services in December 2007.  It was based on the principle of having health and personal social services provided on the basis of the child being supported within the family and the local community.  It was aimed at all those working with children and families - policy makers, HSE managers and front-line workers.  Its aims were to enable earlier interventions before problems became critical.<\/p><p>It is important to highlight some of the worthwhile steps taken by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government in coalition with the Green Party and others.  The Children Act 2001 was the primary statutory framework for the youth justice system.   It adopted a twin-track approach, namely, child welfare and youth justice, to address the needs of children who might be in need of special care or protection and children who offend.  The Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 provided for the High Court to have statutory jurisdiction to hear applications by the HSE for special care orders in respect of children where their welfare might require their detention in a special care unit.  Those issues were progressed at the time.  The Minister was a Member of the Seanad then and supported the measures.<\/p><p>The Bill is a culmination of the work that has been done.  Each piece of work was a step in the right direction.  There had long been a need for the issues to be addressed.  The Murphy report and other reports highlighted the abuse of children in the State by people in positions of responsibility.  Cases of abuse within the family, as opposed to abuse by unrelated individuals, now come before the courts on a regular basis.  It is an appalling situation that arises in all societies not just in this country.  Nevertheless, the State is in a better position to respond in a positive way.  I do not take issue with the recent response to the cases of suspected child abduction.  One could ask whether one could stand idly by and not take any action.  I accept there might have been overreaction and the situation could have been handled better but it is preferable to be proactive than not to take action in a case of potential abuse.  I believe all the staff involved were working in the best interests of the children concerned.  The information received might not have been accurate but if no action were taken the Minister would be held responsible.  It is no harm to be vigilant in that respect and for inquiries to be carried out without taking the ultimate step of taking children into care or away from their families.  Balance is required.  If a child is secure within a family then tests and investigations can be carried out without taking a child into care.  Lessons have been learned.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acted on information brought to its attention by individuals.  If the Garda had not acted it might have been responsible if child abduction were involved.  Where child abduction has taken place, we must ensure that it is resolved.  The case in Greece was a possible case of abduction but the circumstances surrounding it are unclear.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on the successful passage of the referendum on children.  It was the ultimate decision of the Minister to set up the agency that is becoming reality.  She will get support for the Bill within this House where we have such expertise as there are many Members involved in child care issues.  It is interesting to note that Senator Coghlan is the only male on the Government side of the House today while Senator Quinn and I are the only males on the Opposition side.  Child care affects fathers and men as well as women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700016#Q00200","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385555700,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700017#R00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1385555700,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I am pleased to see the two young ladies from the Department.

It provides us with immense potential to streamline and co-ordinate services for children.  It is a huge and impressive undertaking involving three source agencies &ndash; the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  I see the evidence and appreciate the seriously hard work that has been done by the Minister personally and her departmental officials.  I thank Liz Canavan, assistant secretary at the Department, for a thorough briefing on the Bill yesterday afternoon and also the Minister for her clarification at the briefing.<\/p><p>I fully agree that what we are striving for now is to get the agency operational by 1 January 2014, the establishment date.  In that vein, I wish to be very clear that I am approaching this Bill in as supportive and constructive a manner as possible.  Any issues I raise are in the context of the fact that we are all striving to produce the best possible agency.  I will do everything I can to ensure the Bill&rsquo;s passage through this House.<\/p><p>I followed closely the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.  I acknowledge and welcome the fact that the Minister has made significant changes to the Bill, in particular following suggestions from civil society organisations such as the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and Barnardos primarily.  We have a unique opportunity to ditch ineffective systems and to finally make sure that children get the treatment they deserve, and that families get the supports they require also.  I am concerned about the emphasis on management and the centralisation of services.  I understand it in part but I fear the creation of a bureaucracy.  What we want to do is ensure consistent standards throughout the country.  An effective and accountable child and family agency will be a monumental step forward for a country that has so spectacularly failed some of the most vulnerable children in the past.<\/p><p>We must ensure consistency and standardised practice on the ground.  This opportunity has been a long time coming.  I thank the Minister for bringing it to fruition.  We know that history is unforgiving.  As the Minister outlined, there have been more than 30 reports.  We must learn from our failings and demonstrate clearly that is the case.  We are duty bound to get this right and everyone is striving for the best outcome for children.  I will submit a number of amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage in an effort to strengthen the Bill before us today.  I will make every effort to ensure the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the House.  I look forward to a fruitful debate.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister on her role in securing Government approval of a proposal to strengthen legislation on aftercare, by introducing a statutory right to an aftercare plan.  This will be done by way of an amendment to the Child Care Act 1991 and is an essential component to ensure stability in care and to enable young people to make the transition from care to independence in a safe, progressive, tailored and appropriate way.  The Minister may be assured of our support when she brings this landmark legislation through the House.<\/p><p>At this juncture I want to focus on how we can ensure that we give the new agency the best start possible and restore public confidence in our child and family services.  The Minister mentioned the referendum on children and when I travelled around the country, the biggest concern related to how people had been treated in the past by the agencies or how they perceived they would be treated.  These perceptions are significant with regard to how people feel and we should not diminish those feelings.  It is important we find ways to instil confidence in this new opportunity we are discussing today.<\/p><p>We heard in the news today about the potential overrun in the HSE.  I will not get into a debate on that, but it gives rise to more concerns about the resources that will be transferred from the current HSE operations to the Child and Family Agency.  Can we guarantee there will be enough of a budget transfer to do what is planned today?  Can we guarantee there will be no loss of services?  What improvements can we expect?  I am concerned the agency may start with a deficit.  That would be like a ball and chain being added on the starting line.  I fear that the transfer of resources may mean the transfer of a deficit.  This would be totally unacceptable.  We have an opportunity with this new agency and we need to use it.  During Committee Stage, I will look more closely at the details of the budget for the agency, particularly with regard to outsourcing.  We know the agency has a budget of approximately &euro;545 million, and I understand &euro;100 million of that will go to outsourcing.  I will seek further clarity on that on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>The issue I want to focus on today is the issue of special care.  The issues in this regard are indicative of some of the issues I am raising about confidence and how we go forward.  Under the special care order of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011, only children and young people aged from 11 to 17 with serious emotional and behavioural difficulties that put them &ldquo;at a real and substantive risk to his or her health, safety, development or welfare&rdquo; and who are unlikely to receive special care or protection &ldquo;unless the court makes such an order&rdquo; can access these facilities.  An example of this may be a child who is self-harming, suicidal, abusing drugs and-or alcohol, where all other attempts by the Health Services Executive have not stabilised the current, serious situation.  Rightly, one has to go to the High Court to obtain such an order.  This is an appropriate safeguard due to the nature and seriousness of such intervention and the restriction of the individual&rsquo;s liberty.<\/p><p>The recent report by the HIQA into Rath na n&Oacute;g raised serious concerns.  The response from the HSE was to close the facility, which was relativity new.  One could be forgiven for thinking as a result of that action that there is no demand for places.  However, I understand there are currently 16 children on a waiting list for places and as many as 40 children who have not got onto the waiting list in need of a special care placement.  Having read the definition, I cannot understand how there can be a waiting list for special care.<\/p><p>I am conscious that we are sending children to facilities abroad.  For this to be done legally involves a time limit.  Therefore, this involves returning to the High Court time and again to extend the period.  The State is paying substantial costs both legally and for the provision of these places outside the State.  Can we not develop a home grown solution that will be in the best interests of children?  I am also concerned about the current arrangements around applications and placement for special care.  The personnel in the HSE who decide whether to initiate a High Court application for special care are the same personnel who manage the number of special care places that are available.  This is a serious concern because of the implicit conflict.  Somebody said to me that the philosophy is: &quot;If we do not have a place, we do not make an application in the first place.&rdquo;  Surely need and the best interests of the child should be the driving and deciding factor in whether a special care order is sought.  Are we failing children today?  Are we failing the 16 children on the waiting list?  They have been assessed and identified as needing special care.  At the least, I ask for the Minister's assurance that this practice, as outlined, will not carry over into the new agency.  There should not be a waiting list for special care.<\/p><p>The Minister was right to say we need to look at co-operation and bringing services together.  I agree we must break down the barriers between agencies and services.  We need an informed and integrated approach and for all of them to be under one roof.  One of the regrets I have as we move forward with this is that children with disabilities will not be under the roof of the agency.  Public health nurses will not be included either.  All too often we hear that public health nurses are identifying upstream issues relating to a young child.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the special rapporteur on child protection gave us what could be called a master class on children's rights.  One of the issues he raised was the issue of alcohol as a risk indicator and the need for social workers to consider this.<\/p><p>The issue now is how are all of these other services to communicate and liaise with the new agency.  We have talked about integration and working together.  Let us look for example at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS.  We would assume, judging by its name, that this service would transfer to the new agency.  CAMHS caters for young people up to 16 years, with an extension on occasion to 18 years.  Social workers on the ground say they find it extremely difficult to access CAMHS, particularly once a child has been put into care.  It is almost as if the perception is that once they are in State care, the State cannot outsource the facilities to CAMHS and will deal with them in the community.  This is a further cost on the State.  There is a concern that if CAMHS does not transfer to the new agency, this will further exacerbate the difficulty social workers are experiencing accessing these services for children.  We have seen in the child death report the critical role that CAMHS plays.  I do not understand why it is not being made part of the new agency.  Is it because it does not want to be?  This is a serious concern.<\/p><p>There is plenty more I could say, but I will keep it for Committee Stage.  I am anxious to ensure the agency will be about all children and child welfare and that its remit is not limited.  I do not question the Minister's commitment, but the Bill is about outlining and putting down a foundation for the future.  It is about a future when none of us will be here.  We need to grasp the opportunity we have and maximise the potential of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700017#R00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385556300,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her and her staff on bringing the Bill to the Oireachtas.  They have undertaken and completed an enormous amount of work.<\/p><p>This Bill will establish a stand alone agency that is concerned with the welfare of children and families.   Members on all sides have recognised and acknowledged that this is a huge step forward.  Until now, we had 4,000 staff scattered across the sector, but now we will have an interagency approach.  We know from previous experience that where we have several agencies dealing with children with difficulties, some children get lost in the system.   This is the first time, with the exception of section 20 of the Child Care Act 2007, that we are taking an interagency approach and are mentioning the word &ldquo;interagency&rdquo; in our Statute Book.  This is a hugely positive reflection on the work done by the Minister.<\/p><p>Under the Bill, child welfare and child protection will be a priority.  This change is long overdue and badly needed.  The needs of children are complex, as are the needs of families.  Having a stand alone agency to deal with child related services recognises these complexities.  It will allow for the delivery of effective services, a much more thorough and focused analysis and a more accountable delivery of services.  Irish children deserve no less.<\/p><p>As we move forward with this Bill, it is important we remember how we got here and what happened in the past.  We cannot forget the litany of cases since the Kilkenny incest report was published in 1993.  Those reports and reviews read as a litany of failure and silence.  They reflect on a time when we feared authority and where no action was taken.  Since the Kilkenny incest case report recommended that those with responsibility for the support and safeguarding of children be brought together under one roof, we have had a litany of failures, right up to the report last year by Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons on the deaths of children in this country.<\/p> <p>The commitment in the programme for Government to establish the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the appointment of a full Cabinet Minister marked the first step towards real change in dealing with children, their welfare, care and rights.  The State, sadly, has a long and shameful history of letting children down and the Minister is determined to put this right.  She successfully steered last year&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s rights referendum which enshrined these rights in the Constitution for the first time.  This legislation will establish a stand-alone agency for children and families which will be built on accountability and be child focused.<\/p><p>I compliment all of the agencies involved such as Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance which have done sterling work in this area.  There are multiple agencies that do excellent work as advocates for children.  Some of this work is remunerated, but much of it is unpaid, undertaken by people who work above and beyond the call of duty.  They include child care workers, parents and voluntary staff who put in long hours without pay.  They do it because they are interested in the health, welfare and protection of children.<\/p><p>The Minister stated family resource centres would continue to play an important role in the community-based models for early intervention and family support services, as envisaged in the children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  This is welcome as the services local family resources centres provde in communities are invaluable.  I am glad that their role will not be diminished.<\/p><p>I am pleased that this legislation is before the House.  Clearly, the establishment of the agency is an ambitious undertaking.  The Bill sets out a strong framework of public accountability, with the Minister establishing the policy objectives for the agency and its board being responsible to her for its performance.  It involves the bringing together of over 4,000 staff and a budget of nearly &euro;600 million from three existing bodies to be led by a single management team.  The leadership of the Child and Family Agency is in place under the stewardship of Gordon Jeyes.  Senior managers were recruited by open competition and will provide the capacity, as well as the leadership, the agency requires.  Each of the senior managers will have child and family services as his or her exclusive priority.  Below that management level, there is an emphasis on strong local management operating within a clear national framework.<\/p><p>The Children's Rights Alliance has acknowledged the sterling work of the Minister, describing the new agency as a powerful vehicle for delivery for children.  It is welcome that we have reached this point and will have an inter-agency approach to delivering child welfare services, although we may not all agree on everything and there may be issues that we need to tease out.  I congratulate todays&rsquo; announcement of more funding for the area-based childhood, ABC, programme.  The issue of alcohol abuse is raised in the House every week.  Easy availability and cheap pricing are the main difficulties in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, has said legislation in this area is moving forward.  It really should be at the top of the Government&rsquo;s agenda because alcohol abuse causes significant problems for families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700018#S00200","speaker":"1152","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385556900,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, back to the House.  Before she was demoted to the Lower House some years ago, she played an active role here.<\/p><p>All Members support this Bill.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout said she planned to improve it on Committee Stage.  I look forward to seeing her proposals.  <\/p><p>I commend the work done by the Government in this area and this landmark legislation.  The new Child and Family Agency is very much needed, not least because of the significant increase in the number of child protection referrals, even in the past year.  I hope the agency will be given adequate resources in order that it can help children and families effectively.  I hope it will also bring a cultural change, one based on best international practice.  I also hope it can play a strong role in child care inspections, given the number of concerning incidents in recent months of the mistreatment of children in cr&egrave;ches.  The agency needs to have strong powers of enforcement and perhaps even to impose fines to ensure a high quality service is guaranteed.<\/p><p>The number of deaths of children in State care is concerning.  It is envisioned the agency will play a more effective role in this area by providing a more tailored service.  Will the Minister explain what she is doing to ensure social workers will not be over-burdened with red tape and administration?  We know this is a problem, meaning that there is less time for social workers to work directly with children.  For instance, in the United Kingdom Ms Sue White of Lancaster University studied the integrated children's system on which child protection workers must record their every deed.  She stated, &quot;It regularly takes up 80% of social workers' days because red icons flash at them if they miss deadlines, its demands feel more pressing than their home visits.&quot;  We have a similar problem here.  While no one disputes the legislation will be a change for the better, we have to be practical and learn from the experiences of other countries, especially in terms of the administrative burden.<\/p><p>Will the Minister comment on the allegations that the Garda acted alone and did not consult social workers before the recent removal of Roma children from their families based on false allegations?  Will this legislation have any effect in ensuring this will not happen again?  Will the Garda still be able to act rashly or can the Child and Family Agency have more power?  For instance, will the Garda be legally obliged to consult the agency before any Garda action on suspicions about a child or its parents?  I am sure there is a place for the agency in this regard.<\/p><p>Critical to the running of the new agency is the mandatory reporting of child abuse.  What about the reporting of abuse of elderly people?  Elderly people can be as vulnerable as children and there appears to be massive under-reporting of such abuse.  Can we do more to strengthen the legal provisions in this area?  The report, A Total Indifference to our Dignity, published in 2011, stated older people's dread of going into nursing homes was such that many would see abuse by their family as more acceptable.  California's elder abuse Act provides for a confidential Internet system for reporting instances of elder abuse instead of a telephone line.  In November 2010 it was determined that 27% of callers hung up rather than wait on the line to report abuses, leaving seniors and dependent adults at further risk of abuse.  The secure Internet system requires mandated reporters to provide the same information as required in writing or over the telephone.  This service has been made available at no additional cost to the State of California.  Does the Minister have any view on this development?<\/p><p>Also in California, regardless of whether they are paid, anyone with full or intermittent responsibility for taking care of an elderly person is considered a mandated reporter.  California law protects mandated reporters from being sanctioned or penalised for making reports.  The reports remain confidential, while mandated reporters are protected from civil or criminal liability when acting in good faith.  These examples are worth considering in the wider context of the Bill, especially as the agency is called the Child and Family Agency.<\/p> <p>I support the Bill.  Senator van Turnhout is talking about some amendments on Committee Stage.  We all wish to support the Bill but also, maybe, to improve it if possible.  The Senators' comments are made in the spirit of trying to improve the Bill rather than trying in any way to hamper the ambitions and targets the Minister has set.  The Minister has done a great job.  Let us ensure she has the full support of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700019#T00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385557500,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and commend her on her introduction of the Bill.  It marks a major step forward in child protection and welfare services.  As already noted, it is one of the most significant public service reforms in the life of this Government.  The programme for Government undertook to fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services by removing child welfare and protection from the HSE and ensuring the creation of a dedicated child welfare and protection agency, reforming the service delivery model and improving accountability to the D&aacute;il.  This is interesting because, presumably, since the Irish people have chosen to retain the Seanad, that means the Seanad as well.  Perhaps it should be accountability to the Oireachtas rather then the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>We are all aware of the historic failings in child protection services in this State, as other speakers have mentioned.  Over the last decade we have seen approximately 17 reports chronicling the Irish State's dismal failure to protect Irish children.  More recently we have seen independent reviews into, for example, the deaths of 23 children who were in contact with HSE services in 2012.  That report raised concerns over ongoing matters which we should be very concerned about, particularly the heavy workloads and under-staffing in social services.  The Minister has done great work in increasing the number of social workers, but this remains a concern.  The number of young people who died by committing suicide while in contact with State services was of great concern.<\/p><p>That report, and a number of others, raised concerns about poor co-operation between State agencies and substandard assessments of vulnerable children's needs.  In half of the cases in the report, inter-agency reviews would have assisted in their management.  There has been consensus in a number of reports about the lack of harmonisation of services for children and the fact that the current complex operational system is damaging our capacity to protect children.<\/p><p>A key recommendation of a number of the reports has led us to where we are today.  In particular, the task force on the child and family support agency recommended an integrated model of service delivery with inter-agency working and the merging of a range of primary prevention, early intervention and therapeutic interventions into a single agency along with child protection and welfare services that were within the HSE.  The task force recommended the establishment of an independent agency rather than an attempt to bring matters more fully under HSE control.  It examined a number of other models and came down on the side of the independent agency approach for a number of reasons.<\/p><p>Credit is due to the Minister in a number of other areas that sit four-square with the matter before us today - for example, the introduction in 2011 of the Children First guidelines, which brought about a greater awareness of child protection issues and the need for more extensive reporting.  The proof of the success of that measure has been the rise in the number of reports of abuse and neglect of children.  In 2012 more than 40,000 cases of abuse and neglect of children were reported, a damning figure by any standards.  Other reforms include the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  Much progress has been made and I congratulate the Minister on that.<\/p><p>We are here to acknowledge the failures in the system and ask whether creating a child and family agency will improve outcomes for children.  I believe it will, for two reasons.  First, the failures identified are being addressed in great measure by what is before us today.  The new agency will have a staff of more than 4,000 and a budget of nearly &euro;600 million.  On the face of it, the transfer of child protection, welfare, preschool inspections, domestic and sexual abuse services, child and related community psychology services into one agency with the staff and budget coming, as it does, from the HSE, together with the merging of the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board, seems as though it should address many of the concerns about inter-agency co-operation.  However, I have a number of questions.<\/p><p>There have been concerns about the transfer of what is seen as a flawed corporate culture within the HSE into the new agency.  Steps must be made to ensure that flawed corporate culture is not allowed to dominate the corporate culture of the new agency.  There were concerns that some of the measures included do not go far enough and that some of the functions the task force recommended to be included in the new agency, such as speech and language therapy, will not be transferred in the immediate future, although the Minister is committed to reviewing this.  Children's detention schools will remain within the Minister's Department and will not be brought into the new agency, and there will be no change to the hospital social worker situation.  This represents a risk of lack of follow-through when children present within a hospital scenario.<\/p><p>Resources are of concern, given the 10.5% rise in the number of people aged 17 and under between 2006 and 2011.  Although we have a slight easing back on that, we are still in a positive population growth scenario.  Reports to the HSE children and family services increased by 36.5% between 2007 and 2011.  It is important to acknowledge the need for resources for this agency if it is to do the job it is intended to do.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the need for resources within communities generally.  The Minister and others have made the point that, irrespective of how successful this agency is, the fact remains that many of the difficulties faced by children and families today are economically driven and relate to poverty and social exclusion.<\/p><p>I welcome the launch by the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, today of the area-based childhood program 2013 to 2016.  Unfortunately, I do not think &euro;30 million will cut it.  Examining the criminal justice system, those in homeless provision and those in substance-abuse provision, we can see that many of the difficulties created by poverty and social exclusion lead to poor outcomes for children in these situations.  I very much welcome the Minister's commitment to amending the Child Care Act 1991 regarding after-care services.  The fact that 1,500 children are receiving after-care services is excellent and most welcome.<\/p><p>I would like to see inspection and regulation of all child care arrangements, not just preschool.  I am very concerned about this issue and will raise it at the Labour Party conference this weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700020#U00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1385557500,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700020#U00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1385557500,"counter":93,"content":"<p>More than 50% of children in this State are cared for in informal child care scenarios, and these children should not be excluded from protection.

Senator Leyden referred to the number of women in the House versus men.  The gender ratio has improved since we started.  At that point Senator Leyden was the only man in the Chamber, and I was saying to myself, \"Terry, blessed art thou among women,\" and asking myself if children and family are still the women's prerogative.  Hopefully not.  We were talking about women in politics.  The emphasis needs to change to joint participation and I am delighted to see the gender balance has improved in the Seanad since we started, because when we first examined it the balance was 75:25 and decreasing.<\/p> <p>I sincerely commend the Minister, her backroom staff and the Department for introducing the Bill and for the most comprehensive approach taken to drafting it.  I understand the scale of the work which has gone into the unification of the various agencies and Departments involved with families and children.  It is a highly positive step in streamlining accessibility to the services.  We are all very aware of the failures which have occurred in child protection services in the past.  I know from experience that it is a very complex area to monitor and that a huge number of groups work with families and children.  The legislation and the agency will streamline them and get them talking to one another.  The Minister has outlined her philosophy which involves communication, integration, bringing people together, assessment, intervention, co-operation and the relationship between and responsibilities of the various agencies involved.  This was very badly needed.  We will now know who is doing what, who is responsible for what, when, where and how.<\/p><p>The inclusion in the programme for Government of the establishment of Ireland's first dedicated child and family agency was very important and the Minister recognised its urgency.  The legislation addresses the issue of gaining public confidence and trust in the protection and esteem we afford children.  The aims and objectives of all child protection legislation must have the welfare and best interests of the child at heart.  I disagree with Senator Terry Leyden who stated it was all about the agency.  The legislation is not all about the agency; it is all about the child and getting agencies and groups working in the best interests of the child, as evidenced by the regulations and provisions, with the best interests and views of the child being taken into account throughout.<\/p><p>The establishment of the agency places a direct focus on child protection and other linked agencies.  It is the first time in our history that such a unified approach is being taken, enacting into law real political action and change, for which I commend the Minister.  It is clear that the process involved and the project in general are highly ambitious and the end product is something in which we can take pride.  The structure of the authority is transparent and easily traceable, from the area manager to the CEO.  If there is a breach or issues arise, the structure allows for a clear line of responsibility and accountability for the various factors involved.  It aims to ensure no child will slip through the net or system or be neglected by the State.  We should have this structure in every Department and I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Minister for taking this route.<\/p><p>I welcome the composition of the board which is not based on a prescriptive approach.  A multidisciplinary approach is needed for a huge organisation such as the new agency.  It must be a big agency to co-operate with all of the various facets involved.  The budget of more than &euro;500 million is welcome, but given the importance of this area, we could obviously do with more.<\/p><p>It is clear various experts and expertise are vital to ensure the efficiency of the agency.  I welcome the expertise in the areas of finance, communications and human resources.  This process needs strong leadership and a comprehensive approach to enable the best decisions to be made.  Listening to the voice of the child and giving it due weight according to age are provided for in the legislation, which is welcome, as all too often children are to be seen and not heard.  I hope we will achieve optimum results for the capital invested in child welfare services, which is what we strive for.  There has always been a contentious debate about the balance between keeping children within the family and keeping them from the home.  The Minister has highlighted the importance of early intervention to ensure the child is kept and that the family is helped in the home.  This is her philosophy which she has outlined many times in the House.  I have also outlined it.<\/p><p>I welcome the dialogue on performance in managing and awarding funding, as the task force on the legislation recommended.  It allows for the prioritisation of certain key areas and the Minister to keep the structure in line with other Government policies.  This is based on the OECD approach whereby multi-annual budgets are seen to be more valuable to services.<\/p><p>The issues involved are very sensitive and I have seen those who work in the area.  I highlight the need for minimum qualifications and welcome the training aspect.  Will the Minister consider providing assistance for the training and upskilling of some of the very good staff who have been working for years in playschools and preschools, including those which use the Montessori method?  People with experience working with children must be recognised.  I ask the Minister to comment on this issue, on which she and her team have carried out hugely significant operational and logistical work.  A previous speaker mentioned informal child care services.  I welcome the continuation of area-based childhood services and the CDI in Tallaght, with which the Minister is familiar.  I also welcome the eight new projects announced today, on which I congratulate the Minister.  <\/p><p>We could speak about this issue forever and it would be no harm to do so because family, child care and elder care services are very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700020#U00500","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385558100,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to discuss this important legislation.  The Child and Family Agency Bill is lengthy and presented a very difficult task which involved a long consultation process and the amalgamation of services, while trying and succeeding on paper to develop an innovative service.  I hope this will remain true in practice.  The Bill has many aspects which I welcome, including providing for the guidance and powers of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to whom the agency will report.  The Minister has a large role to play in securing funding and setting the guidelines which will set out goals for the agency.  Each year ahead of allocating funding she may set out important recommendations and guidelines for the agency which will respond with these goals and recommendations in mind in its annual submission.  Unfortunately, funding can only be approved on an annual basis, which is to the detriment of public services but is in no way specific to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is a problem for every Department.  We must address the need for multi-annual funding, a point on which many of my colleagues will agree.  I understand the current constraints, but service providers accessing funds from the new agency will need certainty and long-term thinking to address all of the issues associated with their work.<\/p><p>When watching the Bill pass through Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I was delighted to see the Minister taking an open-minded approach to amendments and concerns raised.  She accepted as many amendments as was reasonably possible.  Prior to publishing the Bill, she engaged proactively with the sector and for the past 18 months has worked in conjunction with sector partners to bring the agency to fruition.  Through my research on the Bill I have learned that the Minister carried out immense work in the area, for which she should be highly commended.<\/p><p>Departmental officials and the Minister did the right thing when it came to the structure of the board.  It will be expected to provide for oversight and overall guidance.  It will include not only those knowledgeable in the field but also those with a background in governance, human resources and financial management, which is very important.  State bodies should look towards providing for a broad range of expertise in accordance with the Government's decision to widen the opportunity for board membership.  They cannot be run as effectively and efficiently as possible if we do not provide for this broader range of expertise.  It is imperative for this issue to be considered as all State bodies should be fit for purpose.<\/p><p>I greatly welcome the fact that the agency will operate on a commission basis with services providers, but, unfortunately, this will involve an annual funding operation.  We need to think long term.  Most importantly, the Bill reiterates the importance of considering what is best for the child which can often be lost in legislation or when we speak about structures and agencies.  I am sure the agency will ensure a more cohesive and efficient approach for families and, most importantly, provide the best outcomes for the children who, unfortunately, will come into contact with children's services.  Many social workers and non-governmental organisations do their utmost to provide security and protect the well-being of the child and through this agency I hope we can further improve on the great work they do.<\/p><p>From my experience - I recently raised a matter on the Adjournment regarding child protection services - social workers in County Louth do fantastic work, but they are short-staffed and stretched thinly, like so many others throughout the country.<\/p> <p>We need to ensure through this new agency that the children are the No. 1 priority and that the second priority is to create the conditions for good staff morale.  If anything is to be successful, staff need to be happy in their jobs.  Social workers and staff in this sector do tremendous and often selfless work.  They need to have the appropriate conditions and staffing levels to continue to provide this vital service to the community.<\/p><p>On a personal note, I would like to welcome the Minister's announcement with the T&aacute;naiste this morning of funding of &euro;30 million for the ABC project, and I am particularly delighted that my own county of Louth has a project, which I have supported long and hard and which has been included as well.  I know they do outstanding work and the Minister will be delighted with it.  Without being biased, I think she made a great decision to ensure that they are on it as well.<\/p><p>I look forward to the implementation of the agency in the new year, and I would like to wish the Minister the best of luck as I know it will be a busy few months.

In the referendum last year, the people endorsed a constitutional amendment to strengthen the rights of children.  I was very pleased to support that referendum and was pleased with the outcome.

Sinn F&eacute;in believes this Bill is a step forward, although we also believe there is a very long way to go.<\/p><p>The appointment of a Minister and the establishment of the Department arguably came at the worst possible time economically.  However, it could be argued that in economically harsh times, children need even greater protection and enhanced representation more than ever.  In that context, the allocation of a budget of &euro;439 million to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 is modest to say the least, albeit an increase on 2012.   The fact of the matter is that this Government pumped billions of euro of public money into Anglo Irish Bank, while only allocating less than &euro;500 million this year to the Department responsible for the children of Ireland.  Even worse is that one of the smallest allocations in the Revised Estimates for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a &euro;2.5 million State contribution for the area-based response to child poverty.  I note the Minister stated the bulk of the funding for this programme, &euro;29 million, comes from Atlantic Philanthropies.  This covers just three disadvantaged areas in this State and the Minister hopes another three will be added next year.  There is a bitter irony in this.  The Government is topping up a grant from an international charity to address child poverty, while the same Government is increasing child poverty through its futile austerity policies.  This is an indisputable fact, as we need only point to the cut to child benefit, which represents the single worst assault in many years on the incomes of families with children and which hits low to middle-income families worst of all.   Moreover, this occurred in the wake of the children&rsquo;s referendum. <\/p><p>While a total of &euro;2.5 million is going to a handful of areas to address child poverty - any funding to address child poverty is to be welcomed - in budget 2013 a full-year cut of &euro;142 million was made to child benefit and Members should stop to think about the contrast between these two figures.  All cuts to budgets that affect children will undermine the positive work and the future plans of this Department, including the plans for the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>While the explanatory memorandum states that the new agency on its establishment will assume responsibility for child welfare and protection, including services relating to the psychological welfare of children, it does not require the new agency to take into account the views of children in matters pertaining to their lives and welfare.  This is something I had understood to have been established clearly, certainly in the spirit if not the letter, on foot of the children's referendum.  I believe the Minister should strengthen the commitment in this legislation on Committee Stage.  The new Child and Family Agency was of course initially intended to be called the child and family support agency.  Sinn F&eacute;in has raised the matter of the dropping of the word &quot;support&quot; from the title of the new body previously, but the Minister has not adequately replied to our questions.  I am in no way assured there is not an ulterior reason for so doing.  In replying to Second Stage contributions, will the Minister expand on whatever she has already said on this matter?<\/p><p>The Family Support Agency has been a key player in addressing a range of challenges that present in the lives of families.  It had a board that included representation from the Family Resource Centre National Forum and again, despite repeated questioning, the Minister has avoided clarity on the make-up of the interim or transition board and the board of the new Child and Family Agency.  Will the Minister take the opportunity today to explain the reasons for the disbandment of the Family Support Agency board and why she has not appointed an interim board since then?  Will the Family Resource Centre National Forum have direct representation on the new Child and Family Agency board and, if not, why not?  There is considerable concern among those involved across the network of family resource centres that without critical representation, their character, ethos and long-established focus will be placed at risk.  Surely the access that has served the sector so well should be maintained and the Family Resource Centre National Forum should have board representation on the new agency.<\/p><p>There is also serious concern about current child protection services and the real position relating to social worker numbers.  The Minister was at pains, over several months last year and earlier this year, to assure the House that the promised recruitment had been progressed and, if not complete, was nearly completed.  However, we learn from the recently published report that addresses child protection service in Waterford, Roscommon and in south-east Dublin, that in 96 cases brought to the attention of the HSE child protection services, less than half were adequately addressed.  The report states that there were &quot;many families in which the circumstances for children did not improve despite the involvement of statutory services.&quot;  Perhaps the Minister might respond to those reports as well.  <\/p><p>I support the Bill, but we have a long way to go in this State to address child poverty.  Nobody wants to see any citizen living in poverty, but unfortunately we have far too many in this State living in poverty and to see children living in poverty has to be a motivation for all of us to do more and provide as much resources as we can to deal with that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700022#W00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1385558700,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being with us and for bringing forward this Bill, which is very welcome.  I thank her for her announcement this morning of &euro;30 million for nine projects around the country.   One of those projects is in my old local electoral area of Knocknaheeny in Cork.  I think &euro;1.8 million is going in there and it is very welcome news for the area to give that support to parents and young children, and to give them that start that they need.  It is a very good decision.  It also provides an indication of the reform that she is bringing about, and this Bill is very much in that spirit, and we are now setting up new structures to deal with a very complex area.<\/p><p>There has been a very good debate on all aspects of the Bill.  I would like to focus on one aspect under sections 56, 57 and 58 of the Bill in respect of the scrutiny of the engagement of services that are not under the control of the Department or the HSE, but which are independent agencies.  I welcome the way this is drafted in section 56.  I think it is very comprehensive in that it vests in the Minister the powers to make sure that there is adequate accountability.  I have been dealing with this area over the last three months.  Out of the health budget of &euro;13.3 billion, &euro;3.27 billion is paid out to 2,680 organisations.  It is interesting to look at the appendix to the annual report of the HSE, where those 2,680 organisations are listed.  It raises the question about the level of scrutiny, something that has already been raised recently, and whether there could more incidences of organisations working together.<\/p> <p>Once the legislation goes through, the Minister will take over responsibility for funding a large number of the agencies.  I read the appendix and noticed that 2,311 agencies receive less than &euro;100,000 but that still adds up to a lot of money.  A lot of agencies receive various amounts of funding ranging from the highest at &euro;238 million down to &euro;100,000.  Each  agency has an administrative structure and people who work on the ground.<\/p><p>I shall outline an issue regarding State agencies and quangos that arose in the lead-up to the last election.  In the pursuit of reform, and I am not saying one can do so with legislation, we should encourage agencies to work together.  To be fair, every one of the agencies have very dedicated and committed people who do a very good job.  An awful lot of the people who work in the agencies work way beyond their call of duty in terms of service and quality of work.  I do not in any way question their commitment.  I just wonder whether we can achieve greater efficiency by encouraging people to work together, both the State and voluntary agencies.  At the same time we could get better value for money and provide a more comprehensive service.  That is what we should work towards which will not be easy to achieve.    <\/p><p>I wish to extend my compliments to the people who drafted the Bill.  I have gone through it with a fine tooth comb, particularly sections 56 to 59.  The Department's level of scrutiny is welcome.  The legislation is about accountability.  It means that when the Department gets funding it will make sure that it delivers the service that it has been contracted to provide.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to it being enacted.  Reform is needed right across the board in the area and the legislation is just one of a number of steps that will be taken by the Minister.  I thank her for the work she is doing.  I thank her for announcing funding this morning which is important for the area and all of the other areas.  I thank her for bringing forward the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700022#W00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385559300,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Senators for their contributions and their general support for the Child and Family Agency Bill.  As every Senator has said, the legislation is about delivering more effective services and better inter-agency work.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Leyden for his comments.  I take his point about the future development of the agency.  The task force did recommend engagement with the public health nurses under its remit and the mental health services.  In the first instance, quite a number of agencies will be joined so there will be a lot of personnel and a lot of management and legislation will be needed.  Developing the agency will be discussed in the months ahead.  In the first place, we will try to see how effectively we can link up with the agencies and the professionals outside of the agency.  Equally, we will consider more involvement and engagement within the agency by some of the professionals.  We need to have very good inter-agency work with the child and adolescent psychiatry services and public health nurses.  A number of Senators made the same point.  All of the evidence that we have proves that we are fortunate to have public health nurses in Ireland and that early intervention is very dependent on them.  Many public health nurses have expressed a great interest in getting involved in the agency's work and I would like to see that option developed.  <\/p><p>We will examine the other recommendations made by the task force as times goes on.  Obviously we had to take an incremental approach to the organisations, agencies and professionals moving into the agency.  I am very conscious of the task force report.  The Senator referred to the initiatives taken by previous Governments along with the ones stated in the Bill.<\/p><p>I accept that the free preschool year is extremely valuable.  This morning I attended a conference to launch the Growing Up in Ireland study where I heard more evidence of how the scheme helps a child cope with his or her transition to primary school.  The study was conducted on a cohort of children aged 5.  This is the first time that we have evidence on young people who had the benefit of a free preschool year and their transition into primary school.  It is great to have evidence that proves they have made a very good transition to primary school despite the economic situation that some of their parents must face.  Part of today's legislation builds towards a second year because it deals with quality in the sector.<\/p><p>A number of Senators asked about training.  I can inform them that there is a training fund of &euro;3 million for next year that will deliver subsidised training to the sector.  It is a very low paid sector so the funding will help child care services in the early years.<\/p><p>I thank Senator van Turnhout for generally supporting the Bill and take her point about the importance of a budget.  Like every other Minister I must fight for the budget.  Recently I was told at a meeting that I should remind Ministers Noonan, Howlin and the remainder of the Cabinet that they were children once.  Yes, they were.  As I said, other Ministers will remind the entire Cabinet about the need for health services, roads and everything else.  We all try to get the best budget for our respective Departments.  I am fighting for the best possible budget for the Child and Family Agency but there are ongoing challenges in the area.  As the economy improves the area is ripe for investment.  <\/p><p>With regard to the Senator's points on children in need of special care, I wish to inform the House about the latest figures.  Earlier this month there were 17 children in secure special care and five children in high support facilities.  We propose to increase the number of special care places from 17 at present to 35 places.  Those places are needed.  Nine places are due to come on stream next year and the remainder will follow in 2015 and 2016.  A number of units will also have increased capacity.  I take her point about a waiting list for special care.  Obviously we must try to avoid a waiting list.<\/p><p>The new Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service, ACTS, has also been developed in the past year and is in place.  It provides a specialist assessment and intervention for children in special care or detention.  It is extremely important to have such a service.<\/p><p>A number of Senators made the point, and I have picked it out of some of the contributions here today, that the agency should have the appropriate culture and response to individuals in place.  That is extremely important because we have all heard individual stories where there was not a good response.  A positive culture involves training, resources, management and style of leadership.  We have made changes.  We have a new management team.  We have built a greater and closer relationship between management and front line staff so we do not have as many levels of management in between.  The initiative should make a difference.<\/p><p>We must examine various ways to provide support to workers.  We must ensure that the new agency is viewed as an exciting and challenging opportunity.  That is not easy to achieve whether one has worked in commerce, like Senator Quinn, or social services.  A lot of demands are placed on staff and we must support morale, build teamwork and offer training.  All of those elements will make a difference.  <\/p><p>I wish to inform the House about social worker recruitment.  The current number of child and family social workers in post is 1,385 whole-time equivalents.  All 270 posts recommended by the Ryan report have been filled.  I shall outline one of the problems.  Due to age and gender profile and budgets social worker numbers are constantly in flux.  At present there are 250 vacancies with approximately 110 arising from maternity leave.  Recently we have filled 114 vacancies and a further 136 posts are being filled, of which 51 have been accepted by candidates.  I obtained a budget increase of &euro;6.7 million that will rise to &euro;12 million in a full year to support further child protection reforms, including additional recruitment.  <\/p><p>Clearly, Mr. Gordon Jeyes and his managers must operate in an environment where we have asked them, not only to establish a new agency, but manage within a defined budget which they will have to do next year and at a time of increased demand.  Senator Hayden talked about the 10% increase in population.<\/p> <p>Clearly, that has implications for early years services, primary schools and a new agency dealing with early intervention, children and families.  We need to ensure the budgets reflect the increases appropriately.  That is a challenge because, with primary schools, the budget must reflect the increase <i>per capita<\/i>.  However, we need to think all the time about the other services the children use and the proportionate budgetary demands that a population increase makes on them.<\/p><p> Quite a number of Senators have spoken about inter-agency work and its importance.  I can only agree.  We have provided for this in the legislation for the first time.  There has to be inter-agency work.  There is no question but that it is all in the implementation.<\/p><p> Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about the resources challenge and the need for child care inspections.  The changes I am making in this Bill to the child care legislation will mean higher standards and tougher penalties, as the Senator suggested.  It is appropriate that there be tougher penalties.  Under the legislation, there will be better mandatory training for staff.  The training fund and mentoring programme we announced in the budget will make a difference in ensuring higher standards.<\/p><p> Many parents have been very surprised and shocked at what they saw on &quot;Prime Time&quot;.  People have known for a long time that we have needed to invest in quality but there was insufficient investment in the training and mentoring of the staff.  The wages are low.  I introduced subsidised training this year to ensure people will have, at a minimum, qualifications at FETAC levels 5 and 6.  This is essential if we want to ensure children in early years services receive the kinds of support they need.  It is unquestionable that there are many great providers but if one wants to improve standards one must invest in training and supports for workers.<\/p><p> Senator Quinn made a point about elder abuse.  The protection of disclosure regarding children and vulnerable persons may cover a certain amount of what the Senator is saying.  With regard to children, we will obviously be introducing effectively mandatory reporting for certain professional groups.  It was interesting to hear the Californian example with regard to elder abuse.  We need to be reporting the issue in the same way as child protection concerns have been reported.  There is much greater awareness of the need to report to child protection issues than there was heretofore.<\/p><p> Senator Aideen Hayden spoke about the workload.  I take her point on social workers and the need for our teams to be operating at the highest capacity possible.  If they are not, it is extremely difficult for them.  There is a role for the universities that has not yet been explored in terms of training social workers such that they can work on the front line in child protection.  There is room for a more co-ordinated approach by the universities to support front-line workers.  I would like to see more initiatives in this area.  It is an area in which I would like to get involved myself, and I intend to do so.<\/p><p> Senator Hayden spoke about the culture needing to change.  I certainly agree with that.  The Senator highlighted the issue of poverty.<\/p><p> A number of Senators mentioned the ABC programme, which involves a &euro;30 million investment.  Approximately &euro;15 million is provided by the Government and approximately &euro;15 million by Atlantic Philanthropies.  It will operating in 13 areas and it is obviously an important initiative.  What solves the poverty problem primarily is creating jobs and getting the economy right.  There is no question but that this will make the biggest difference for children and the more vulnerable families. That is why the increase in the number employed is so critical.  As we get the economy right, it is important that we secure the intervention that will support vulnerable families.<\/p><p> With regard to the ABC programme, we have identified 12 areas that will not get funding at this stage but which have been identified for mentoring work.  Perhaps at a later point, with further investment, they, too, will be in a position to get funding and deliver more services.  A very important point on the ABC programme is that it involves an inter-agency arrangement.  The T&aacute;naiste and I launched it this morning.  The Docklands, an area receiving over &euro;1 million in funding, has 48 agencies.  This indicates the number of agencies overall.  We all know about this from the areas we represent.  The Docklands has 48 agencies working together to deliver services.  They applied as a consortium of 48, which is really to be welcomed because it means people are pooling their resources, their thinking and means of implementation.  This should lead to better services for children.<\/p><p> Senator C&aacute;it Keane talked about inter-agency work and integration.  She referred to identifying who is responsible, when, where and how.  On a recent visit to Washington to examine services for children at risk of coming into contact with the law and who are in detention, a key recommendation made by the service providers was that there be a lead person working with each child, and that the other agencies would work with that child also.  A lead person should be identified, and we need to be much more conscious of that.  The Senator also asked about training.  We will certainly invest more in that.<\/p><p> Senator Moran talked about morale.  Senator David Cullinane made some comments on poverty.  I agree with him that we need to tackle it.  The policies of the Government are targeted at improving the standard of living of everyone but we have obviously taken on a huge challenge in that regard.  I have outlined the figures on social work numbers. <\/p><p> Senator Burke talked about the groups that will be providing services and the need to have proper accountability.  This is spelt out very clearly.  It is a matter of partnership with the voluntary organisations but accountability applies to everyone.  That is clearly articulated in the legislation.<\/p><p> I hope I have addressed most of the issues that Senators have raised.  Senator Henry raised the issue of alcohol, as did a number of others, including Senator van Turnhout.  Alcohol is featuring very heavily as a precipitator of referrals to child protection services and of children entering care.  We really do need to highlight the critical public health issues.  Fairly shortly, the Minister of State Deputy Alex White will be bringing forward for the first time a public health Bill in this regard.  It will really make a difference because it will address the problem.  Senator Aideen Hayden referred to the pricing and availability of alcohol and the public health problems it causes, particularly among young people.  These factors will be dealt with in the legislation.<\/p><p> I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate today.  This is the beginning of a new part to the work.  The legislation is a good foundation but it is very challenging.  There are many connections with economic circumstances because, as the economy improves and as more employment is created, circumstances for children and families will improve and there will be less pressure on families.  It is important today to talk about how well so many children are doing.  We are data-rich at present in respect of our children.  The vast majority are doing extremely well but the legislation is to ensure we react in the best way possible to the benefit of the more vulnerable children and change our inherited legacy of fragmented services and poor response.  I thank all Senators for their contributions on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700023#X00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385559900,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559900,"counter":104,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700024#Y00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559900,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700024#Y00400","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385559900,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 3 December 2013.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013: Report and Final Stages","time":1385560500,"counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700025#Z00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1385560500,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, to take Report Stage of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013.

Amendment No. 6 inserts new section 9.  The Bill amends a number of sections to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in regard to the determination of applications for a debt relief notice, DRN, and to facilitate the processing of these applications by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which provides the relevant approved intermediary for this process.  The debt relief notice instrument is one of three new debt resolution processes in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  It provides, subject to relevant criteria, for the write-off of qualifying debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period for debtors with essentially \"no income and no assets\".<\/p><p>The first amendment is to section 25 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 where it is proposed to delete the reference in the definition of debt that the debt must be payable within three years from the date of application.  The effect of this deletion will be to allow the debtor to propose the inclusion of debt which does not become due until future dates such as term loans in the debt relief notice.  The primary objective of the proposed amendment is to assist the MABS and its approved intermediaries in operating the debt relief notice process.  The amendment is intended to respond to the following operational difficulties: first, calculating the exact amounts owing under term loans, hire purchase and lease arrangements and instalment orders which may have more than three years to run; and second, that a certain interpretation of the previous definition would appear to allow settlement of up to three years of such debts but then allow continuation of payments to creditors to resume in year four onwards.  Such an outcome would run counter to the policy intention that all of the debts, other than the four categories of excluded debt, owed by the debtor must be included in a potential debt relief notice.  Neither was there an intention of allowing differential payments to creditors, as all must be treated equally.  The change to the definition of debt would capture all of the debts owed by the debtor.  If these debts total less than &euro;20,000, the debtor should qualify for a debt relief notice which, if approved by the court, is effective immediately.  At the end of the three year supervision period associated with the debt relief notice, all debts are written off, no matter what the original term of a debt may have been.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700025#Z00400","speaker":"979"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385560500,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385560500,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 and 7 form a composite proposal and may be discussed together, by agreement.

The amendments to sections 17, 105, 130, 140B and 141 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 are similar and have the objective of seeking to reduce the costs associated with bankruptcy.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has proposed that it would provide cost free a facility on its website for a bankrupt to &quot;notice&quot; that fact, as required by law.  Currently, only publication in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i> and a daily newspaper circulating in the State is permitted.  This change in regard to the giving of notice could save a bankrupt person a considerable amount.  The amendments to these sections of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 will allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to prescribe how notice of the adjudication is to be given by the bankrupt.  The essential change is to now include the option of using the website of the insolvency service for the notice, in addition to <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.  This new option can help to allay some of the concerns about the costs of bankruptcy which have been raised in recent times.<\/p><p>  The proposed amendment to section 140A of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 is in regard to the register of insolvency decisions arising from the operation of the EU regulation on insolvency proceedings.

Were the Minister of State to succeed in his endeavour - he has our support in respect of it - such a regime would be a major asset to the country in the future.  Senator Quinn and I have tabled a number of amendments designed to facilitate the development of such a regime.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 relates to instances where proceedings will be taken in the Circuit Court rather than in the High Court.  We request that an annual estimate of the savings involved and a breakdown per case - with information on the total number of cases - be provided.  It is good that we are going in the right direction and, as stated on Committee Stage, that the position would be quantified.  It would also be useful to ensure that we will not revert to a situation where high costs might obtain.  In other words, we should set a target with regard to the amount to be saved per case.  If one were extremely concerned about costs, one might not want to engineer a situation whereby taking a case in the Circuit Court would cost one more than would be the case if it were taken in the High Court.<\/p><p>There are also concerns to the effect that legal costs relating to personal injury cases are eroding the savings that were made when the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, was established.  I agree with the Minister of State that there are savings to be made.  However, it would be useful for the Oireachtas to be informed as to what will be the level of such savings and to be able to review the position in order to ensure that said level will be maintained.  A responsible parliament should ask for information of this nature and assist the Government in fostering better standards of governance and public administration.  If we have a goal, let us see whether we are moving closer to it.  I hope we are doing so.  The Minister of State has our support in the context of attaining that goal.  I hope information will be made available in respect of how much it is hoped to save.<\/p><p>With so many things happening at present, including our escape from the troika, trying to put the public finances in order, there is a view to the effect that we have not sufficiently addressed the issues relating to the regulation of accountants.  However, we cannot do everything at once.  The public is still extremely annoyed with regard to what previously happened in the area of financial services.  The Parliament must be vigilant and that is why I have tabled amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  I will speak to the latter when the time comes.  Parliamentarians would do society a service if they were to promote the making of both improvements and cost savings in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700025#Z01200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385561100,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  I cannot improve on what the Senator stated except to state that the words we used on Second Stage and Committee Stage were a reminder of the need for this legislation.  We noted the need for this legislation.  It is not enough to be reminded unless we are also reminded of the savings that are anticipated.  The amendment states, \"The Minister shall submit to the Oireachtas an annual estimate of the savings due to the operation of this amendment.\"  That makes sense and I see no reason such an estimate should not be provided.  I do not believe that providing it would give rise to any cost.  Such an estimate would serve as a reminder of the savings which can be achieved.  We spoke earlier about the high cost of litigation in Ireland and, in that context, facilitating these changes would make a great deal of sense.  It is not just a question of saving money; time would also be saved.  The recent case relating to Lissadell House in County Sligo served as a reminder of the high costs involved.  I understand that the legal costs in said case amounted to something in the region of &euro;7 million.  That is a reminder of what can occur when a matter goes before the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett explained the intent behind the amendment very well.

However, the latter amends sections 2 to 4, inclusive, of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.  The addition of a further subsection to section 2, unrelated to any specified section of the 1990 Act, is not legally sound and would not achieve what is intended.  Nor is the wording which refers to the operation of this amendment sound.  The Company Law Review Group, in its report on examinership, recommended increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for examinership in respect of small private companies.  The business organisations represented on the group - IBEC, ISME and SFA - were all supportive of this proposal.  The report highlights the costs associated with the High Court procedure as a reason many SMEs do not currently avail of examinership.<\/p><p>It is not possible, as a result of the number of variables attaching to the examinership process, to quantify estimates of the savings which might accrue.  For example, there may be different levels of legal representation in different cases.  In addition, the number of applications to the court during the examinership process may - depending on the complexities involved - vary between cases.  In every examinership there are two essential hearings before the court.  The first of these relates to seeking the appointment of the examiner and the second to seeking confirmation of his or her report in which he or she will set out his or her proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.  There may also be a need for a hearing in order that creditors might have their say before the appointment of an interim examiner is confirmed.  However, in the course of the examinership - and depending of the complexity of the circumstances in a particular case - there may be a need for the examiner to seek either direction from the court on various issues or permission to exercise certain powers.  It is, therefore, impossible to estimate the number of occasions on which there will be recourse to the court during an examinership.<\/p><p>There is no typical examinership.  The level of legal and other costs will be determined by the simplicity or complexity of a particular case.  In light of the findings of the Company Law Review Group to the effect that &quot;in the form currently available to small private companies (SPCs), is inadequate by reason of the costs involved which are prohibitive&quot; and the acknowledgement that examinership is generally not a possibility for such companies because of the costs associated with the High Court procedure, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to establish a base from which to measure future cost savings for other small companies arising from the use of the Circuit Court route instead.<\/p><p>There is no existing group which can be used for comparative purposes.  Attempting to compare the costs relating to an examinership in the High Court in respect of a larger company with the possible costs for a small company in the Circuit Court would not be a meaningful exercise.  There is no standard or comparator against which assessment can be made.  Furthermore, the data relating to the cost of an examinership may not be publicly available and would need to be sourced from companies.  This would impose an additional administrative burden on companies, which could not be compelled to provide the necessary information without the introduction of legislation.  The Senator's amendment does address this particular issue.  It is not unreasonable to assume, however, that taking an examinership case in the Circuit Court should be less costly than doing so in the High Court, particularly as the legal costs relating to the former and lower than those which obtain in respect of the latter.  Access should also be improved by the proximity of the Circuit Court to the companies seeking to avail of the examinership process.  There may also be less of a need to resort to the court during the examinership process if a particular case is less complex.<\/p><p>These are all factors which should result in lower costs for small companies using the examinership process in the future.<\/p> <p>However, in the absence of data on the costs currently incurred by small companies in the examinership process because they do not seek examinership, it would be less than robust to attempt to estimate savings by a comparison of speculative costs in an unused High Court process and the proposed Circuit Court process given the variables I have outlined.  I assure the Senator that we have given this matter consideration and studied his contribution on a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  I have outlined all of the difficulties that arise in attempting to calculate savings that would accrue under this proposal.<\/p><p>On a general level, I remind Senators that Government policy on business is to provide for an operating environment in which obstacles that could impede its development are removed, where possible, and it is encouraged to develop and flourish.  The proposal before us is firmly located in this category.  The granting of the possibility of direct access to the Circuit Court to small business in the manner proposed offers businesses the opportunity to restructure their affairs and return to an even keel at a cost that is likely to prove more affordable than being required to take the High Court route.  This is, therefore, an intrinsically laudable proposal and on that basis alone, it merits the support of the House. <\/p><p>With respect to Senator Barrett, I cannot help but feel that his proposed amendment has overtones of a measure to police legal costs.  I do not consider that a company law measure such as this is the appropriate medium in which to pursue such an objective.  Perhaps he will consider approaching the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue as the amendment is not appropriate to the legislation before the House.  On that basis, and with respect, I do not propose to accept it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700026#AA00300","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385561700,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Where do we go from here?

I will raise the issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the National Competitiveness Council which has advised the Minister of State that legal costs are a problem.  We have to move public policymaking on to a higher level than is evident here.

That remark is not directed at the Minister of State.<\/p><p>After all the mistakes we made and are now trying to correct, a more quantified and scientific basis for policymaking is needed.  Writing a provision into a Bill and then stating, as the Minister of State did, that it is impossible to estimate its costs is a step backward rather than forward.

People outside the House want us to introduce this measure.  As I stated, important tasks of supervision in the area of audit and accounting have been neglected as a result of the work the Government and Oireachtas has been required to do.  Some matters have been held up by the Director of Public Prosecutions and certain court cases are not due to be heard until next year.<\/p><p>  We need to bring this matter into the public arena, a view that is shared by Ms Helen Hall, director general of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  Ms Hall notes in the latest IAASA annual report that accountants' work is being inhibited and states the following: <blockquote>These confidentiality provisions have had and continue to have an adverse impact on IAASA's advocacy role.  We have had initial discussions with the Department on this matter and plan to engage further in 2013.  The intention is to explore amendments to these confidentiality provisions as part of IAASA's consideration of the Companies Bill 2012, with a view to striking a balance between the protection of confidential information provided to IAASA and the desirability of transparent reporting on IAASA's activities.<\/blockquote>The 2012 reports subsequently states: &quot;For example, we view the provision of information on the results of our financial reporting examinations, without necessarily identifying the name of the issuer involved, as assisting in building an awareness of, and confidence in, financial reporting.&quot;  As the Minister is aware, this goes back to 2008 when these problems struck the country.  Ms Karen Erwin was chairperson of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority at the time.<\/p> <p>She stated in her annual report that what was happening increased risk levels and, in turn, significantly increased the risk of serious and lasting damage to public confidence in statutory financial reporting and the accountancy profession.  I do not think the good reputation of the accountancy profession has been restored.  The profession feels it is inhibited by section 31 of the legislation, which prohibits disclosure and discussion.  The report contains redacted sections.  It is like a red rag to a bull for Members of the Oireachtas to be given documents that are redacted.  How are we supposed to make decisions?  The Milliman report on the health insurance sector contained 55 vital sections that were blacked out.  That is an insult to our democracy on the part of those who did the redacting.<\/p><p> Three <i>prima facie<\/i>cases are being pursued against one accountancy firm in regard to Anglo Irish Bank.  The report of the commission on banking referred to the low standards observed in accountancy practices at the time.  The Minister of State had to remove these sections from the Companies Bill, which while admittedly complex and lengthy is moving very slowly.  I think it has been in gestation for three years at this point.  We are moving this amendment in view of the cost to the economy of what has happened in Irish accounting, the slowness of the procedures and the extremely light penalties imposed thus far.  In the last six months, six fines were imposed for an average fine of &euro;1,500.  The average costs in seven cases were &euro;3,870.  There were eight reprimands, of which four were severe and four were not severe.  In view of the &euro;64 billion we put into the banks on the basis of accounts prepared by these accountancy firms, which we read into the record on a previous occasion, Parliament has to respond in a more urgent way to ventilate the issue.  The probable basis for all the troubles this economy has encountered is that we bought banks on the basis of the accounts which the Minister for Finance and his successors found to be inaccurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700027#BB00800","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385562300,"counter":129,"content":"<p>On a point of order, are we speaking to amendment No. 4?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700028#CC00200","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1385562300,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I hope so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700028#CC00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1385562300,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700028#CC00400","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1385562300,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform needs to get involved with the oversight and compliance regimes of the audit sector.

There are delays to the investigation of the claims of inadequate standards in Irish accounting.  We have an extremely large bill which has set the country back.  Is the quality assurance regime adequate and will the sector bear it?<\/p><p>Some of the activities are not investigated because they are not covered by the specified categories of companies.

Perhaps this will be the game changer because what we have done thus far has been expensive and has not satisfied the public in respect of regulation of financial services in Ireland.

All of us agree there was a malaise and a morass regarding auditing and accountancy in a particular period but in dealing with the specific amendments I must be cognisant of whether they are applicable to the legislation before us and I would say that the last amendment was certainly not.<\/p><p>On this amendment, notwithstanding the robust case made by Senator Barrett which is a commentary on the lack of robust auditing and accountancy proceedings, the case we would make is that it is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it for the following reason.  Under section 22 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, not later than four months after the end of each financial year, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, must make a written report to the Minister of its activities during that year.  The report must be prepared in such a manner and form as the Minister may direct.  The Minister shall ensure that a copy of the annual report is laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than six months after the end of the financial year to which it refers.<\/p><p>Additionally, under section 22(4), the chief executive officer and the chairperson of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority shall give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts, when required to do so, on the following matters: the regulatory and propriety of transactions recorded or to be recorded in its accounts; the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority's economy and efficiency in using its resources; the systems, procedures and practices used by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority for evaluating the effectiveness of its operations; and any matter affecting the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority that is referred to in a special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Whenever requested to do so by any other committee appointed by either House of the Oireachtas or appointed jointly by both Houses, the chief executive officer and chairperson of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority shall account to the committee for the performance of the functions and the exercise of the powers of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.<\/p><p>The provision relating to quality assurance in the Bill is strictly confined to empowering the IAASA to impose a levy on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities to defray the costs to it for carrying out the functions of external quality assurance in respect of those public interest entities.  Additional functions relating to the European Union recommendation on external quality assurance are proposed to be conferred on the IAASA in the Companies Bill 2012 while the balance of the related functions will be conferred to IAASA by amendment to existing regulations.  <\/p><p>An additional requirement will be that the IAASA reports annually on the overall results of the quality assurance system.  Quality assurance is the regular inspection of statutory auditors and audit firms to ensure that systems are in place that will allow for consistently high quality audits.  It is important to distinguish between the audit process itself and the quality assurance function.  An audit is an independent examination of the financial statement - what used to be referred to simply as &quot;accounts&quot; - of a company or other entity which results in the expression of an opinion by the auditor on whether the financial statements have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable reporting framework and on whether the financial statements give a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the financial year, and the financial position at the end of the financial year.<\/p><p>In Ireland, audits are conducted in accordance with international standards on auditing, that is, both for the United Kingdom and Ireland.  International standards on auditing are issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.  The UK and Irish version, reflecting a small number of modifications, is issued by the Financial Reporting Council.<\/p><p>An audit opinion relates to the results of a specified period and the position as at a specific historic date.  It does not constitute an opinion on the financial health of the company in question nor is it nor can it ever be a promise or guarantee of the future viability of the entity.<\/p><p>Quality assurance is the regular inspection of statutory auditors and audit firms to ensure that systems are in place that will allow for consistently high quality audits.  The scope of inspections includes an assessment of auditors' compliance with applicable auditing standards and independence requirements, a review of the internal quality control system of the audit firm and the testing of selected audit files.<\/p><p>The proposed transfer of the quality assurance function from the recognised accountancy bodies to the IAASA in respect of the audit of public interest entities is in line with best international practice.  For example, the United States has such a system under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to which Senator Barrett referred on Committee Stage, as have Canada, Japan and Australia.  <\/p><p>Within the European Union at least six member states have moved to this independent quality assurance system, including the United Kingdom, Germany and France, and smaller ones such as Belgium and the Netherlands.  This system is acknowledged as the best way of ensuring the necessary independence of the quality assurance process.<\/p><p>A system where the professional bodies execute the quality assurance function on its member auditors and audit firms of public interest entities is considered to lack the requisite degree of independence.  In the EU new legislative proposals on audit are currently at an advanced stage of consideration and these proposals include a mandatory requirement for member states to have the quality assurance of auditors and audit firms which conduct audits of public interest entities carried out by public oversight bodies such as the IAASA.  The US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is understood as not considering that it can place the same level of reliance on audit reports of public interest entities produced in jurisdictions which do not have an independent oversight system of quality assurance as those which do.  <\/p><p>Among the additional functions that will be conferred on the IAASA to enable it to undertake the proposed quality assurance functions are powers to take disciplinary actions or impose penalties in respect of auditors and audit firms.  The intention is that these powers of sanctions and penalties will be proportionate and dissuasive.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700029#DD00200","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1385562900,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Does Senator Barrett wish to make a final comment on the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700029#DD00300","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1385562900,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I believe this amendment is necessary.

There are plenty of members of that committee, not least its chairman, who would have wanted to address the issue that \"it was unfortunate that sufficient timely and challenging auditor dialogue was not used to influence the banks' business models and lending practices\" before we got into so much trouble.<\/p> <p>It was unfortunate that sufficient timely and challenging auditor dialogue was not used to influence the banks' business models and lending practices before we got into so much trouble.  What we have has not worked sufficiently quickly.  The House is regularly asked to address reports on financial institutions that have failed and to put the burden onto the taxpayer, which has caused so much misery in the country.  We are seeking this dialogue in this amendment, which will not happen unless the House wants it to happen, and that is why I put it in the legislation.  We have do everything better in this area and I am here to assist the Minister of State in that regard.  Had we been more attentive in the past - and by the past I mean any year since 2010, when some of those regulations were written - and had we ventilated these issues, it would have been far better for the country.  I am including myself in this.  The only accountants I have seen before the finance committee have been the ones seeking further tax breaks in the budget for their clients while hardly acknowledging that we were trying to solve a budget deficit.  If we had a surplus, they would be delighted to give us ways to spend it in the interest of their clients.  We have not called them to account on these matters and society is the poorer for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700029#DD00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1385563500,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 18; N\u00edl, 23.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Sean D.

We referred to the matter before the last 28 seconds of the match on Sunday.  The Bill states that: &quot;&quot;third-country auditor&rdquo; has the same meaning as in Regulation 3 of the Regulations of 2010.&quot;  I wish the words &quot;notified to the Oireachtas&quot; to be added.  The Minister of State might recall that two of the countries on the black list were New Zealand and Bermuda.  We briefly discussed New Zealand.  The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has mutual recognition agreements with Canada, Australia, England, Wales, Hong Kong, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and the United States.  The Bermudans are trained by the Canadians who have some of the highest financial standards to which we seriously aspire and envy.  I do not know how those two countries got on the black list.  I did not know it until the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, told me when she was before the House.<\/p><p>  There is wisdom in the Oireachtas which could help the decision-making process and notify people that as far as Members of the Oireachtas are concerned &ndash; certainly this one &ndash; there appears to be an anomaly in the classification of a third country auditor as being in some way inferior.  The list that was read out by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, included New Zealand and Bermuda, which was somewhat of a surprise for both those countries.  There is wisdom in these Houses, between the 60 Members in the Seanad and the 166 Members in the other House.  We would never have found it out had it not been for the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It does not do any harm for the Oireachtas to ponder how country X got on the list.  Ireland has links in many countries due to this being the most internationalised economy in the world.  We might have some information that is useful in the discussion.  Otherwise, New Zealand and Bermuda could still be on a list of countries in which we judge the procedures to be unsatisfactory.  I have asked some accountants and they did not know of any reason for the two countries to be on such a list.  These things happen and if the Oireachtas were notified it might do nothing or it could make the arguments I have made.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  The more people who are in the loop, the more feedback one will get.

The Commission is not commenting on the quality of audit in any of the countries listed in the annexe.  It simply states there is not enough information for it to assess the equivalence of the oversight systems.<\/p><p>  Recycle 2 of that decision includes the statement:<blockquote>The Commission has carried out assessments of the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entries of the third countries and territories listed in the Annex to decision 2011\/30\/EU.  The assessments were carried out with the assistance of the European Group of Auditors Oversight Bodies.  The public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities for those third countries and territories were assessed in the light of the criteria set out in Articles 29, 30 and 32 of Directive 2006\/43\/EC which govern the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit firms of the Member States. <\/blockquote>Recycle 4 states: <blockquote>Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Egypt, Mauritius, New Zealand, Russia and Turkey have established or are in the process of establishing public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities.  However, information about the functioning and the rules governing such systems is not sufficient to carry out an equivalence assessment.<\/blockquote>I hope this gives some clarity regarding the point raised by Senator Barrett.<\/p><p>  In regard to amendment No. 5, I am sympathetic to the principle of the amendment proposed by Senator Barrett.  However, I am informed that the amendment as proposed does not achieve the outcome the Senator seeks, which is to have a requirement for regulations made under this section to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It has not been possible to have an appropriate amendment drafted, within the applicable deadlines, to enable me to table an amendment today and in the interest of not delaying the progress of the Bill, I propose incorporating the measure into the Companies Bill 2012.  The intention is that the requisite amendment will be included as an amendment in that Bill.  On that basis, I hope Senator Barrett understands we will not accept his amendment.<\/p><p>  In response to a point Senator Barrett raised previously on the substantive Bill, the committee powered through 1,400 sections in two days in an efficient manner.  I acknowledge the role of officials and public servants involved in the process.  While the Senator has made a point about the number of years it has taken, it moved through the committee expeditiously, because it is very much a cross-party Bill.  It is a consolidating piece of legislation and there was agreement from all political sides on the need to ensure we dealt with it efficiently.  We probably set a record in dealing with 1,400 sections in 24 hours, not a bad way to do business in the House.<\/p><p>  I ask Senator Barrett to take on board the points I have made in regard to amendment No. 5.

I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss the Bill, which concerns the criminal sanctions imposed upon our fishermen.  Sea fisheries offences in Ireland are predominantly criminal in nature in terms of the sanctions that apply.  That leaves Ireland as the only European maritime jurisdiction to rely exclusively on criminal sanctions.  This Bill aims to correct this anomaly and to protect fishermen and the future of the industry.<\/p><p>The 2006 legislation, introduced by Noel Dempsey, was an outrageous item of legislation because it criminalised fishermen.  I was openly critical of the legislation, as was Senator Denis O'Donovan.  It was the wrong legislation at the wrong time and it did nothing to support genuine fishermen doing their utmost to earn a livelihood.  Some 75% of the registered fishing fleet vessels in Ireland are under 10 m and it threw the very small fishermen in the same category as factory ships in terms of the sanctions imposed on the fishermen.  That was wrong.<\/p><p>The Irish seafood industry supports coastal communities, directly supporting 11,600 jobs including full-time, part-time and casual employment in the fisheries, agriculture and seafood processing industries.<\/p> <p>That includes full, part-time and casual employment in the fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing industries.<\/p><p> The Irish fishing fleet consists of 2,186 registered vessels, with 1,637, or 75%, of them under 10 m in length.  There are 355 vessels between 10 m and 19 m, 36 vessels between 19 m and 22 m and 158 vessels over 22 m.  Therefore, the majority of the Irish fishing fleet is made up of smaller vessels, with 75% being vessels under 10 m in length.  Under the Common Fisheries Policy there is a requirement on all European member states to enforce an effective system of sanctions for dealing with breaches of community law.  Notwithstanding this, the sea-fishing community in Ireland has been aggrieved at the use of onerous criminal penalties to control even minor breaches of technical regulations.  All stakeholders accept the necessity to retain stiff penalties to control serious quota and environmental breaches but expensive and time-consuming criminal procedures are an inefficient way of dealing with minor technical offences and encouraging a culture of sea fisheries compliance.<\/p><p> For example, section 28 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 provides for stiff maximum penalties of up to &euro;100,000 and these penalties, which may be imposed on conviction, are set out in a table of offences and punishments graduated in reference to the size of the contravening vessel.  These fines are up to and including &euro;100,000 for boats greater than 18 m in length.  The penalties are stiff but in addition to those fines there is also the mandatory tying of a vessel, suspension and revocation of fishing licences and the forfeiture of catch and gear, which are a statutory consequence of almost all offences under the Act.  Taken together, these impose extremely serious penalties, even for non-serious infractions.<\/p><p> This Bill recognises the serious quota breaches and environmental infringes which require the full rigour of fisheries enforcement.  However, Ireland is now the only major maritime jurisdiction to retain an exclusive reliance on criminal sanctions to control sea-fisheries offences.  The European Commission has consistently reiterated its position that administrative penalties are a more effective means of ensuring compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy in a cost-effective manner.  Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland have all introduced a fixed penalty notice regime since 2008.<\/p><p> The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a system of administrative sanctions to provide efficient punishment for minor offences, benefitting both the State and fishermen.  Administrative fixed penalty notices would be introduced as a proportionate response to minor breaches of technical legislation, and that principle has been an established part of Irish constitutional jurisprudence since at least 1961.  Section 103 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides that where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reasonable grounds for believing that a stated offence has been committed, the garda may issue a penalty notice requiring the payment of a specific fixed charge.<\/p><p> The justification for bringing forward the 2006 legislation was constitutional and it could not be changed on the basis of advice from the Attorney General.  However, the independent Oireachtas Library and Research Service has established that the following constitutional principles with regard to a system of administrative penalties exist.  There is no <i>prima facie<\/i>objection to administrative levying of fixed charges or temporary professional suspensions and the process must be done on the basis of reasonable suspicion or some similar formula.  If an administrative tribunal purports to make findings of culpability, there is the possibility of straying into constitutionally suspect considerations.  The current legislative maximum for an administrative penalty is &euro;1,000 and each single penalty falls below the ceiling.  It is not constitutionally relevant for several infractions to be punished simultaneously, leading to a larger total fine.  The alleged infracting vessel must always retain the right to appeal the fine or temporary suspension, and I have built in an appeals mechanism under the proposed legislation.<\/p><p> There is nothing peculiar to fishing that renders it materially different to other examples of administrative tribunal operating in other sections of society.  Particularly, there is no reason a penalty points regime could not be instituted for minor fisheries offences.  Therefore, the Bill aims to complement the fixed penalty notice system rather than replace the system provided for in the 2006 Act.  The option of a hearing in court is retained as part of the primary legislation.  The Bill will also satisfy the European Commission position, as it has again called on member states to ensure a system of sanctions that has a deterrent effect, amending where appropriate legislation so that sanctions have a dissuasive effect.<\/p><p> The aims of the Bill are outlined in the document and Senator O'Donovan will touch on them.  They seek to improve and widen enforcement mechanisms, have an appropriate fine system to match infractions, deal with less serious offences through a new penalty points system and provide an exemption to the forfeiture of gear.  For example, somebody at the moment could have a small vessel tied up for a relatively minor fishing infraction, meaning he or she cannot fish.  Gear is confiscated as a secondary consequence and the person will also end up in court.  There is a major cost to the State with this legal route, and there is also a major cost for the owners of the fishing vessel.<\/p><p> This Bill may not be perfect - I am not saying it is - but we have given it the best shot we could.  We have met representatives of the fishing industry up and down the country.  We were in the Minister's own beautiful county of Cork partaking in an array of public meetings.  West Cork is a lovely part of the country that I visited with Senator O'Donovan, and we have also met fishing representatives from the offshore islands, Mayo, Donegal, Galway, etc.<\/p><p> This Bill will not solve the problems of the fishing industry, and I know the Minister is working towards dealing with quota issues, etc., but it will at least eliminate the criminal nature of small technical fishing infractions involving small vessels.  In opposition, a Fine Gael Deputy, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, who is no longer a Member of the D&aacute;il, brought forward a very similar Bill, although I am proposing that we go further, reduce fines and introduce an appeals mechanism in order to satisfy the constitutional requirement as highlighted by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister will this evening accept what we are trying to achieve in the Bill and at least come half way to meet us.  As I stated on the Order of Business this morning when we discussed the quota issues, we all need to wear the green jersey over the next two to three weeks, leaving party politics outside the room.  We must give the Minister, his officials and the Department our full support, and I hope the Minister will return the favour tonight by at least acknowledging what we are trying to achieve.  We are willing to work with him in every manner in trying to ensure we can support the smaller fishing vessels, and particularly those 75% or 80% of vessels under 15 m in length.  That would be a step in the right direction for the industry.  C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le maith aige and I appreciate the Minister being here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700033#HH00600","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385565000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I take great pleasure in seconding Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's Bill during Private Members' time.  It is an old issue with me and I could write a thesis on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Some of the effects and implementation of that Bill has halted me since that time, although on Committee Stage we managed to have 113 amendments.  Some of those were technical or Government amendments.  There was widespread revolt against the measures that, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill termed it, criminalised fishermen for relatively small offences.  To be technically correct, the Bill was not the first to introduce criminal sanctions, as the Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill 1959 had criminal sanctions for various offences.<\/p> <p>The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act of 1959 had criminal sanctions for various offences and to say that there would never be criminal sanctions for serious fishing breaches would be a joke.  We will never have that utopian situation.  We have a problem out there and while this Bill is not a panacea for all of the ills we face in the fishing industry, it will address some of them.  The former Minister gave me and others who are no longer Members of this House, a clear commitment that after three years, if certain aspects of the Bill were not working or were too severe and draconian, he would revisit it.  That did not happen.  The Fine Gael Party at that time gave clear commitments, particularly to the lobbyists from coastal communities that, once in office, it would revoke the entire Bill.  I do not think that is possible.  However, it is possible to ameliorate some of the severe measures in the legislation and to ensure that relatively minor offences are dealt with fairly.  Indeed, at the time of the debate on the legislation, on the suggestion of myself and others, the idea of the District Court dealing with minor offences was introduced.  <\/p><p>I have been involved with the fishing industry since I was a gars&uacute;n and my family has been involved all the way back to my great, great grandfather's time.  I have never seen such a droch mheas or lack of belief in the future of the fishing industry.  I am not being political in saying this or criticising the Minister.  There is a general level of despair which is growing, mainly because of the issue of quotas, which I will not go into now because the Leader has promised a debate on it before Christmas.  There are grave concerns about the future for small, inshore fishermen and the damage that SACs will do to them.  There is a lack of trust among fishing organisations in politicians generally, Ministers in particular, including the current Minister, and the Department.  That must be healed if at all possible.  If the SFPA really wanted to implement the full letter of the law of this Bill and of the legislation that we as Oireachtas Members hold guard over, every fishing vessel from Killybegs to Kerry, Cork and around to Howth would be tied up.  Fishermen acknowledge that and they recognise that the SFPA operates as a &quot;good cop&quot; in as far as it can.  However, the situation is very serious.  <\/p><p>The Minister has to go to Europe again in December to negotiate on the quotas.  It is like the three-card trick - we win one, we lose one and we see what Europe will give us.  The fishing industry is supporting approximately 12,000 jobs, directly and indirectly.  There was a plan in the 1990s to develop our aquaculture industry with a view to producing 25,000 tonnes per annum.  I am not going to dwell on that tonight because it is another day's work.  There is absolutely no doubt that some of the measures in the 2006 Act must be revisited.  I hope that when the Minister responds to this debate, he will at least accept the thrust and principle of this Bill.  <\/p><p>The easiest thing for me, having lost my D&aacute;il seat in 2007 and having been hammered by the fishing communities of West Cork, would be to fold my tent up and move on but that is not the way I should represent the people of coastal communities.   I have met representatives of many fishing organisations while touring the country with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, visiting Donegal, Ros An Mh&iacute;l, Waterford and Cork, among other places.  The absolute frustration and lack of belief in a future for the fishing industry we encountered is very concerning.  This is true of the big-boat fishermen, the inshore fishermen and those operating the processing factories.  At one stage, there were 11 or 12 processing factories along our coast but now there are only four.  I would don the green jersey with the Minister in the context of extracting better quotas from Europe.  I also believe that we would enhance our exports of fish by having value-added processing onshore, thus creating more jobs and making the industry viable.  <\/p><p>Fishermen get extremely frustrated when they are tied up in port - as happened on Kilmore Quay recently, with several boats tied up - while at the same time off our coastline foreign vessels are catching species of fish which Irish boats are prohibited from catching, or for which they have severely restricted quotas.  That is a very serious issue although I do not wish to dwell on it now.  <\/p><p>I support what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has said in this debate.

They must be addressed at some stage.  Now is not the time for those issues but I look forward to a comprehensive debate on them soon, as the Leader has promised.  This Chamber, now that it has been saved, should be used more frequently.  Debates should not be pushed out to the end of the year.  I asked several times earlier this year for a debate on these issues but because of the Irish Presidency, I bowed to the fact that the Minister was extremely busy.  I now hope that we will have a number of debates on key fisheries issues before Christmas or, failing that, early in the new year.

However, I cannot accept the fact that we have Fianna F&aacute;il Members here trying to change a law which their party introduced when in government.  They criminalised fishermen themselves; they have recognised that fact and now that they are in opposition, they want to change their own legislation.  I respect them for doing that.  They have admitted that their own Minister made a mistake but they had to vote with their own Minister, as we do with ours.  Indeed, we have had to support some difficult measures in recent years.  The fact remains that Fianna F&aacute;il is the party that criminalised fishermen for the offences that are mentioned in this Bill.  Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and O'Donovan have said that they have visited the fishing communities all over the country and I believe that is why this Bill has been put forward.  Those communities are livid because of the 2006 Act.<\/p><p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, coming as I do from the south east of Ireland, where we have quite a sizeable fishing industry.  I am aware of the significance of the fishery regulations and the impact they can have on the fishing communities all over the country.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill rightly said, when in opposition in 2010, Fine Gael brought forward a Bill which proposed the introduction of administrative sanctions for minor fisheries offences.  This Bill was rejected by the then Government, led by Fianna F&aacute;il, on the grounds that it was unconstitutional and undesirable.  That Bill has been referred to today as if it represented <i>manna<\/i> from Heaven.  However, the programme for Government contains a commitment that this Government will &quot;replace the criminal sanctions system for minor fisheries offences with an administrative sanction system to bring Ireland in line with other European jurisdictions&quot;.  As I understand it, the Minister is preparing a Bill to amend the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act of 2006.<\/p> <p>This will address the programme for Government commitment.  Government Senators oppose the Bill on the basis that it contains provisions which are considered flawed.  The Bill provides any offence may be subject to a fix-penalty notice with a fine set at &euro;400 for the first offence and &euro;800 for the second.  The Bill the Minister intends to bring forward will contain an amendment for the system of fixed-penalty notices for minor fishery offences.  It will also propose that the on-the-spot fines will be used in place of the current criminal process for fisheries offences, both small and large, and sets out fines at low levels.  This Private Members&rsquo; Bill is not confined to the minor offences nor does it distinguish between offences that ought to be tried and those which might be dealt with summarily.  The fixed penalties set out in the Bill do not meet the criteria set out by the EU as they are disproportionate and dissuasive.  There is a real danger that this Bill could create a lax fisheries control regime for both Irish and foreign vessels operating in our waters.  This would be damaging to our fishing industry which is entirely dependent on sustainably managed fish stocks.  The Bill would also infringe the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and see the European Commission re-open an infringement case against the State as it did in 2003 and 2005 to address control failures.<\/p><p>The Minister is amenable to introducing his own legislation to address this Private Members&rsquo; Bill&rsquo;s objective.  Being a politician, however, I cannot resist pointing out that Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to rectify legislation that it introduced which criminalised fishermen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700035#KK00400","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385566200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  While I am not opposed to the general objectives and thrust of this Bill, the detail is another matter.  Seafood exports are worth &euro;415 million to the economy, a little known fact among the public.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has drawn our attention to the fact that 11,600 people are directly employed in this sector.  Many of the areas where these jobs are located do not have an extensive employment base outside of this industry.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan pointed to the frustration among fishermen disqualified from fishing due to quotas watching foreign vessels on the horizon fishing those very stocks.  Illegal overfishing is not victimless as it impacts on fishing communities, law-abiding fishermen and future quotas.  It is right and proper that there is a robust system of penalties in this regard.<\/p><p>This Private Members&rsquo; Bill proposes criminal sanctions on foreign fishing vessels which enter exclusive Irish fishing areas and administrative sanctions for first and second fisheries offences by way of prescribed notice as opposed to criminal sanctions.  As the Leader pointed out, in 2006 the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, from that renowned fishing port of Trim, County Meath, saw fit to introduce legislation in this area against the advice of the then Opposition.  Now Fianna F&aacute;il wants to reverse his legislation.<\/p><p>Due process in criminal proceedings takes a long time.  This adds to the frustration of those who believe they are abiding strictly to the law.  This Private Members&rsquo; Bill proposes making dealings with minor fisheries infringements much quicker.  While I welcome this general thrust, the Minister cannot accept the Bill&rsquo;s details.  He has committed to bringing forward separate legislation which will address the commitment in the programme of Government for the introduction of an administrative system of sanctions in this area.  It is ironic to point out, however, when in opposition, Fine Gael proposed a similar Bill to this which the Labour Party supported but it was rejected by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government.<\/p><p>The fixed-penalty notice provisions in this Private Members&rsquo; Bill are not necessarily confined to minor offences which is contrary to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Penalties must be proportionate, effective and, most importantly, dissuasive.  A Supreme Court ruling last month confirmed that penalties must be sufficiently severe to comply with EU regulations.  The Bill&rsquo;s proposed on-the-spot fines may not comply with the constitutional mandate that all offences should be tried by a court of law.  The Minister has proposed he will deal with this when he introduces similar legislation.<\/p><p>We thank the Opposition for belatedly introducing this Bill.

The Bill must be taken in its broader aspect and I know the Minister's bona fides on this issue, that he has done his best on the European quota scenario in Ireland.  However, we must go back to 1973 when we started in the quota system to see how the Irish fishing fleet has been decimated, particularly the smaller vessels along the western coast.  In my home area of Rossaveal we used to have a thriving fishing community with lots of boats fishing out of Rossaveal and the Aran Islands and smaller ports.  Fish factories employed up to 200 or 300 people.  Those fish factories are very seasonal now and employ very few people.<\/p><p> We need to take a broader view on where we are going with the fishing industry.  There has been a major imbalance in how the quota has been shared out nationally.  That must be laid at the door of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations which had scope to change how the quotas were divided among the bigger and smaller players in the industry.  Many previous Ministers could have done much to revitalise the fishing industry along the western, south-western and south-eastern coasts by having a better division of the quota which would have given the smaller polyvalent vessels a better chance to take in and land more fish that would have been processed here on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> We all know we have an ageing population of fishermen in Ireland.  Young people are not being drawn into the industry because it is so hard to make a living and is very dangerous.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports fishermen and their families in making a decent livelihood for themselves.  That is where the debate should be focused.  We do not support the Private Members' motion because it is blatant political opportunism from Fianna F&aacute;il.  The real issue for fishermen is quotas and the dumping of millions of tonnes of perfectly healthy fish into the sea.  This is a ludicrous practice which should have ended years ago and we welcome the fact that there have been moves at a European level to tackle this, although it is taking a very long time.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the EU's commitment that the practice is to end within six years.  It was ludicrous to allow millions of tonnes of fish to be dumped back into the sea because of EU bureaucracy while Irish fishermen were coming under more pressure from the EU because of low fish stocks.  It is imperative that the stated six-year target is met and preferable that the practice be phased out before then.  The end of this practice is crucial for the survival of European fish stocks and the Irish fishing fleet.  Steps must be taken to ensure there is effective policing of this issue and the illegal practices of non-Irish fleets in Irish waters.<\/p><p> The recent briefing, Unknown Waters, by the New Economics Foundation, NEF, makes a case for making the industry more sustainable, profitable and capable of promoting employment.  It said:<blockquote>We know nothing about the health of half of our fish stocks.  Lax government controls and enforcement means 30% to 40% of the fish we land comes from illegal, unreported or unregulated sources.<\/blockquote>NEF and others argue that this issue can be addressed by assembling adequate data on fish stock and the proper enforcement of laws that prevent over-fishing.<\/p><p> We forthrightly opposed the imposition of criminal sanctions in the 2006 Bill.  They were wrong then and are wrong now.  The Government promised, in opposition, to get rid of these criminal sanctions and replace them with administrative sanctions.  I welcome the commitment that the Minister is examining that and will bring forward a Bill to that end, but it is taking a long time and the fishermen need swifter action.  There will be legacy issues of a number of the cases that are in court and must be dealt with, people who have, under the present regime, been hauled before the courts because of minor administrative infringements on the regulations.  One of the most significant issues we have with the Bill is that there is no recourse to the courts for an appeal and that is a weakness, which is why we will not support it.  We need to change the criminalisation of fishermen.<\/p><p> Instead of looking at the fishing industry as a negative, we need to examine what we can do to revitalise coastal communities and make our ports viable again.  The Oireachtas sub-committee is making recommendations such as having a specific heritage licence for the smaller traditional vessels which would allow them to fish free of quota.  We have mentioned that before and it should be examined.  The levels of quota they would use would be relatively small but it would revitalise the industry and the communities where those people live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700036#LL00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385566800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this very important issue pertaining to the Irish fishing industry.  Ireland has 7,500 km of clean coastline which contributes &euro;700 million in national income and supports 12,000 local jobs.  It is vitally important that this resource be protected when necessary from abuse by a minority.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a system of fixed penalty notices for minor fishery offences.  This will bring Ireland into line with other European countries.<\/p><p>I commend my colleagues on the other side of the House on taking the initiative and publishing their own Bill but agree with the Minister that the sanctions contained therein do not present a sufficient deterrent.  The effectiveness of these deterrents is particularly important as illegal fishing can impinge upon those working in the sector, and may have long lasting consequences for fishing stocks and the communities which are dependent on all operators acting fairly.  By moving to replace criminal sanctions with an administrative sanction scheme I anticipate that, similar to road traffic offences, those working in the industry will have a very clear understanding of the range of offences and the consequences of any infringements.  Such a system will take time and consideration before it can be put in place.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister that any sanctions must be capable of acting as a real deterrent.  This is particularly important where an income or a profit may be likely to derive from an illegal act.  The quotas which apply have been hard won by the Minister and his Department to benefit the whole of the fishing community.  With the demand for quality seafood products increasing it is important that produce from Ireland remains on the shelves.  In previous years Ireland was made to pay, by means of annual deductions from the national quota, for undeclared landings of mackerel.  A recurrence in a buoyant market could be detrimental to the fishing sector.<\/p><p>The Bill removes the automatic confiscation of fishing gear on conviction.  The removal of such a provision would further diminish the effectiveness of the sanctions against illegal fishing.  It is important to remember that this sanction is only applicable upon conviction of a criminal offence.  This sanction is not overly harsh.  In many professions, similar sanctions restraining individuals are applied.  For instance if a solicitor contravenes the professional code, his or her practising certificates may be withdrawn.  If an individual chooses to jeopardise the livelihood of others and the sustainability of fishing stocks, real and effective sanctions are the only means of protecting this resource for everyone else.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and acknowledge the positive work his Department has been doing in this area, particularly for his part in bringing all parties to the point of agreeing to the phased introduction of a ban on discards from January 2014 and negotiations on quotas.

I want to express my solidarity with my colleagues, Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and O'Donovan on the legislation as it is a major irritant to the fishing industry, particularly because owners of small vessels have been equated with larger sea going vessels in the context of criminals sanctions imposed.  I know that arguments have already been made.  Section 28 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 provides for stiff maximum penalties.  The fines are extremely onerous, up to &euro;100,000 for boats greater than 18 m in length.  The current system seems unfair and inequitable.<\/p><p>The Bill recognises that serious quota breaches and environmental infringements require the full rigour of fisheries enforcement.  Ireland, as I am sure the Minister is already aware, is the only major maritime jurisdiction in Europe to retain an exclusive licence on criminal sanctions to control sea-fisheries offences.  Why is Ireland the only major maritime jurisdiction to retain an exclusive reliance on criminal sanctions?  I am sure the Minister will address my question in his response.<\/p><p>Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales have all introduced a fixed penalties notice regime which dates back to 2008.  As the Minister will be aware, the purpose of the Bill is to introduce a system of administrative sanctions to provide efficient punishments of minor offences, benefiting both the State and fishermen.  Therefore, the Bill aims to complement, through the fixed penalty notice system, rather than replace the system provided for the 2006 Act retaining the option of a hearing in court.  We believe that the Bill satisfies the European Commission's position that member states are again asked to ensure a system of sanctions that has a deterrent effect and to amend, as appropriate, their legislation so that sanctions have a dissuasive effect.  We argue that the current regime does not lead to sanctions having a dissuasive effect and is an unfair and inequitable imposition, particularly on the small operators in the fishing industry.

We are all concerned about the potential cut in quotas and wish him well in his endeavour.<\/p><p>I thank the Opposition for tabling the Bill and bringing the matter to the attention of the House.  The Minister is well aware of the issues.  It is worth pointing out again, although I do not like to revisit the past, that the existing sanctions were introduced by Deputy Noel Dempsey when he was a Minister.  The legislation tries to tidy up and recognises, in the House, the damage that has been done and that fishermen were criminalised.  The Government is committed to tidying up the matter.  The Minister is committed to sorting out the problem and will bring forward legislation.  <\/p><p>I do not blame the Opposition for using Private Members' time to highlight the issue because I have no doubt that they are extremely embarrassed by their past actions while in government.  I do not blame the Senators but I blame their party and its leadership who facilitated the sanctions.  <\/p><p>I agree with a lot of the sentiments expressed by all Members, including Members across the floor, particularly on processing issues.  I would like to see a lot more jobs in the fish processing sector.  We could create thousands of jobs if we processed the fish caught off our shores and exported a somewhat finished product as opposed to just exporting the fish.    <\/p><p>The Minister comes from an area that has a proud fishing tradition and I refer to Crosshaven and all along the Cork coast.  I have no doubt that he is committed to maximising the return from fish caught off our shores.  I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong but I think just over 1% GDP is generated by fishing.  That figure should be a lot higher for an island.  Fish is one of our natural resources that needs to be maximised.  Successive Governments have failed to invest in the fishing industry or actively support job creation initiatives.  I would go as far as to say that we need a tax incentive scheme.  The term &quot;tax incentive scheme&quot; are dirty words to some because of what went on for the 14 years when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government but they should not be.  We should examine the introduction of tax incentives in order to encourage proper processing and promote fish related industries.  It would mean that fish caught off our shores could be brought to our shores for processing as opposed to travelling to France and other areas. <\/p><p>Ireland must play to its strengths in agriculture, the fishing industry, dairy exports and so on.  The fish sector merits a significant concentration, investment and, if needed, tax breaks to increase the 1% GDP to 3% GDP.  Thousands of jobs could be created if we go about it right.

I shall make a couple of general points in response to some of the comments before addressing the Bill itself.<\/p><p>I shall commence by referring to the fisherman missing off the south-east coast, off Kilmore Quay.  His name is Mr. Patrick Barry, a lobster fisherman and father.  The search continues and our thoughts are with his family and the rescue services trying to locate him.  Unfortunately, it is another difficult situation for a fishing family. <\/p><p>I wish to counteract some of the pessimistic comments made about the future of the fishing industry that I heard here this evening.  The end of the year is always a difficult time, particularly for the white fish or demersal fleet.  Every December we negotiate quotas and then we work together with the industry to decide how to use the quota on a monthly basis throughout the year.  Often times we use a lot of quota earlier in the year and run out of it towards the end of the year.  However, the industry makes the decisions on how to use the quota allocation throughout the year.  December is always a difficult month in terms of fishing quota because we will have run out of some of the total allowable catch quota and fish stocks.  At this time of year the fishing industry is always frustrated and we are feeling it at the moment.  It is important that we look at quotas in the round.  Last year seafood exports from Ireland increased by 17% in value.  That is a much more impressive growth than what has happened in the dairy and beef sectors or any other sector in the food industry.  It increased by 17% in one year.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700038#NN00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1385567400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700038#NN00600","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1385567400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>This year and last year the raw value of quota that was negotiated for Ireland surpassed the &euro;200 million mark.  We have never reached that level before.  We face challenges in the seafood and fisheries sector but we are doing very positive things at present.  The greatest frustration for fishermen is relative stability and who gets a percentage of available quota in waters that Ireland has the responsibility for.  Of course we want to take some quota from Spanish, French, Dutch and British interests, and others.  Everybody who understands the system knows that relative stability is not going to change anytime soon unless we can get a majority of countries and Ministers in the European Union to support change.  Sadly, that is not likely to happen.  Therefore, we must focus on what we can change for the fishing industry and we are doing that in a number of areas.  Let me give the example of a new quota species.  Ireland has two thirds of Europe's quota in boarfish which I hope will be dramatically increased in December.  We secured a significant portion of the quota and are working to add to its significant value.<\/p> <p>Our quota currently is about 60,000 tonnes.  In the past, all of that boarfish would have either been dumped over the side or gone into fishmeal, at a value of &euro;70 or &euro;80 a tonne.  We are now developing markets that can secure &euro;400, &euro;500 and &euro;600 a tonne for that product.  There are exciting and interesting things happening in fishing.<\/p><p> We have also invested heavily in terms of adding value.  The reason for the increased value for seafood exports in Ireland is because we are adding more value to fish that are caught in waters here in Ireland through grading, processing, packaging and so on before we export.  The processing sector is where significant numbers of jobs have been created in towns like Killybegs and others.<\/p><p> We are also encouraging more foreign landings into Ireland, which I know is a frustration for some fishermen, to allow us grade and process those fish here.  The blue whiting story, for example, off the north west coast has hugely exciting potential which is delivering much capital investment in terms of processing facilities for blue whiting.  That is very valuable to our fishing industry.  Obviously, I would like to see Irish boats catching more fish within the rules and in a sustainable way but the second best option, if we cannot catch the fish, is that boats that are catching fish that are not under Irish flags would land it into Irish ports where we will process and grade their fish for them, and create employment doing that.  That is happening in an exciting way.<\/p><p> There are positive developments in this sector.  There is a future, and what is probably the most radical Common Fisheries Policy that we have seen in 30 years has been negotiated and agreed under the Irish Presidency.  Finally, we have a plan to rid ourselves of the scourge of the discarding of fish.  About 1.2 million tonnes of fish is caught in Irish waters and landed to market.  There is probably another 400,000 tonnes of fish caught in Irish waters and dumped over the side dead.  We will end that.  We are changing the quota system now from a landed catch quota to a catch quota and there will be an obligation to land everything one catches, with some flexibilities and exceptions that can allow management systems deliver that on board fishing trawlers.<\/p><p> There is a good deal happening in seafood, processing, adding value, packaging and grading.  We are doing everything we can to help the fishing industry, in terms of the catch industry, to secure as much fish as they can within sustainable rules.  If I have credible science that suggests we have to ease off on a stock or we will lose that stock, it would be irresponsible of me to ignore that, and I will not ignore it even if  we have to make unpopular decisions in the short term to build up stocks in the medium and long term.<\/p><p> In the past two years with help from the Marine Institute, BIM and the rest of the team that negotiates on behalf of the industry we have done a good job in terms of quota allocation on the basis of science.  We got a much better outcome than many people predicted going into those negotiations.  This year, however, the science is very negative particularly around the whitefish and demersal sector.  There are very worrying recommendations in terms of reductions in stocks such as haddock in the Celtic Sea and prawns in the Irish Sea.  We have to compile a scientific argument if we are to change those recommendations.  I will do everything I can to try to do that.  <\/p><p> On a more personal note, since the day I was elected to the D&aacute;il I have wanted to be a Minister for the marine because of my background and how I have grown up.  The idea that I am somehow disconnected from the fishing industry is something I hope is not the case.  If fishermen feel that way, certainly I regret that is the case.  I speak to my colleagues in the European Union about this on a fairly regular basis.  I do not know any other senior Minister who sits around the Cabinet table in the European Union that gives the kind of access I give here to the fishing industry and fishing organisations who meet me and contact me by telephone on a regular basis.  In fact, on the way here I got a text from the head of one of the fishing organisations updating me on mackerel and relationships with Norway, the European Commission and so on.  If there is truth in what Senator Denis O'Donovan has said I regret that and will try to change it, but I hope that is not the case.<\/p><p> In terms of the Bill, I appreciate the work of Senator Denis O'Donovan and Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill in drafting this legislation and accept that it was done with a view to introducing an improved regime for the appropriate control of fishing activity.  I believe that all in this House want to see a strong and vibrant fishing industry that supports employment in our fishing fleet, fish processing and ancillary activities in our coastal communities.  I also consider that there is general support in the House for the introduction of a simplified system of fines to deal with minor fishery offences.  When in opposition, Fine Gael brought forward its own draft of such a Bill and today we have a Bill brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il.  <\/p><p> Since my appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I have sought to develop a good understanding of the issues and constraints that have impacted on setting fines for fishery offences.  I have held detailed discussions with the Attorney General on how a system that gives the option of avoiding a court hearing may be put in place for minor fishery offences.  I am now working with the Attorney General on legal issues to enable the preparation of a Bill amending the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to introduce a system of fixed penalty notices for minor fishery offences.  This proposal follows the commitment in the programme for Government that criminal sanctions for minor fisheries offences would be replaced with an administrative sanction scheme.  Following advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that an administrative sanction scheme would not be appropriate, I am now working to introduce a system of fixed penalty notices in respect of minor fisheries offences which, in fairness, is what the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill is seeking.  The Attorney General has given her support for this approach and is the first to do that for some time.  I am awaiting legal advices on the technical content of such legislation. The intention is that fishermen who have committed minor fisheries offences will have the option of avoiding a criminal conviction.<\/p><p> The scheme I am working to develop is broadly similar to the approach set out in the Bill before the House.  However, the complications with the Bill under discussion today, and indeed with the previous Fine Gael Bill, relate to ensuring that any new regime does not undermine effective enforcement of fisheries law, is compliant with the provisions of the EU control regulation and does not breach the provisions of the Constitution, particularly Article 38 and Article 40.3.2&deg;.<\/p><p> It is important to understand that any action the State can take is constrained by the obligation to act within the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and the Constitution.  The Common Fisheries Policy is applicable across all member states and determines that sanctions must be set at a deterrent level which must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  It is, in any case, in the interests of our own fishing industry that effective controls are in place.  To do otherwise would see the waters under Irish control become a soft target for inappropriate fishing.<\/p><p> I am not in a position to support the draft Bill being introduced here today for the reasons I will outline.  I want to make clear, however, that I do intend to bring forward new legislative proposals that introduce the option of a fixed penalty notice for minor fishery offences and, hopefully, we can do that before Easter.  <\/p><p> In terms of this Bill, there are significant problems with the approach proposed that undermine the option of accepting it here today with a view to introducing amendments as it progresses. The main issues of concern are the following.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes the introduction of a fixed penalty notices for a &quot;relevant offence&quot;.<i><\/i>The offences are not specified and it is for the Minister to identify and prescribe those offences in a table.  There is a fixed penalty notice of &euro;400 for a first offence or &euro;800 for a second offence, both are maximum, to be paid within 28 days from the date of the notice.   A third or subsequent offence &quot;shall&quot;<i><\/i>be dealt with by way of prosecution under sections 38 and 39 of the 2006 Act.  Section 39 of the 2006 Act deals with prosecutions by the DPP, in other words, indictable offences.<\/p> <p> Section 38 deals with summary prosecutions by the Minister of offences other than those specified in a table.  This suggests indictable offences are intended to be dealt with in the first instance by way of a fixed penalty notice for a first and-or second offence.  Further, as these offences are to be prescribed in a table, they cannot be dealt with under section 38 which is confined to offences in a section of the Bill other than those specified in a table.  Section 3(6)(<i>c<\/i>) clearly envisages the issuing of a fixed penalty notice &quot;for multiple fisheries offences&quot;<i><\/i>arising from the same incident.  This approach has a high risk to fall foul of the requirements of EU law.<\/p><p> The appeal system is set out in detail.  The Bill provides for the appointment of an appeals committee in line with procedures adopted by the Minister after consultation with various semi-State bodies and industry, including the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, the Irish South and West Fishermen's Organisation and the Inshore Fishermen's Organisation.  When an appeal is determined by the appeals committee, that determination is to be sent to the Minister with its reasons.  If the appeals committee finds in favour of the appellant, it shall make a recommendation to the Minister as to the action to be taken in relation to the notice.  The Minister can accept or reject the recommendation and while the Minister's decision is final, the Minister may consult various bodies, including the fish producer organisations to assist with his or her deliberations.<\/p><p> The approach taken in the Bill is that fishery offences are criminal offences, but these are dealt with through an administrative procedure.  This approach would not conform to the provisions of the Constitution, particularly Article 38<sup><\/sup>and Article 40.3.2<sup>o<\/sup>.  The reason for this is that the provisions in the Bill exclude the courts from dealing with these offences.  The Minister is the prosecutor and judge.  Further, the appeals system is not through a court of law but a committee.  The system envisaged is purely an administrative one in which the Minister is the prosecutor, judge and jury.<\/p><p> In terms of the Bill, it is proposed to introduce an amendment to remove the forfeiture of gear as a consequence of conviction.  The amendment also removes the forfeiture provision in respect of fish found in any other place other than the fishing boat.  In simple terms, if illegally caught fish are found in a cold store on land or being transported in a truck, they could not be subject to forfeiture.  The analogy is that a criminal involved in a bank robbery could only have the money stolen confiscated when the money is found in his or her car.  The Irish courts have determined that the requirement for forfeiture is a proportionate response to Ireland's obligations under EU law in the enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The rules of the Common Fisheries Policy require that the penalties be effective and dissuasive, in addition to being proportionate.  The removal of the requirement for the forfeiture of fishing gear and restricting forfeiture of fish to those on board a vessel would significantly reduce the penalties imposed for a conviction for a serious fishery offence.  That is not the direction in which we need to go.<\/p><p> Instead of effectively addressing illegal fishing, the Bill risks promoting a culture of non-compliance where those detected would be confident that penalties imposed would be lower than the economic benefit from the illegal fish caught during the fishing trip.  In its current form, the Bill would remove the current deterrent arrangements in place that protect against illegal fishing and risk promoting increased illegal landings and other unacceptable fishing practices by fishing vessels from all member states and third countries and any such Irish vessel operating in the rich fishing grounds inside Ireland's 200 mile zone.  I do not believe that this would be in the interests of the vast majority of law-abiding fishermen, both Irish and foreign, and it would make illegal fishing a more attractive option for operators around our coast, many of whom have no association or links with our fishing communities.  I am confident that it is also not the intention of the Senators who have proposed the Bill to achieve such an outcome.  I believe our ambition - that of those proposing the Bill and that of those in my Department who are going to bring forward a new Bill - is similar.  My objective is to give fishermen who are responsible for a minor fishery offence the option to pay a reasonable fine, proportionate to the offence, and in that way avoid a criminal conviction.  Any such system may only legally be applied to minor fishery offences and should only be considered for such offences if we are serious about protecting the rich fishing grounds in our 200 mile zone which we control.  Most importantly, strong dissuasive sanctions should be applied to operators responsible for serious fishery offences, otherwise we are at nothing.  If we do not protect the stock into the future, we will continue to see a shrinking fishing fleet and fewer people will enter the industry.  <\/p><p> The law is and has to be applied equally to the thousands of vessels which operate in our waters, irrespective of the flag member state of the vessel.  The existing legalisation provides for graduated maximum penalties based on vessel size and the forfeiture of catch and gear.  These sanctions apply equally to Irish, Spanish, French, Dutch, British or any other operator found to have infringed the rules in Irish waters.  They must and will remain for serious offences.<\/p><p> Much work has been carried out in recent years at EU level in the area of control and enforcement of fisheries.  Last year Ireland implemented the provisions of Council Regulation 1224\/2009 - the control instrument which provides for an effective system of control, inspection and enforcement to ensure compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In line with Ireland's priorities, these new regulations promote a level playing field in controls across the European Union.  There was a view in the past and there is a view to a certain extent today among many in the Irish fishing fleet that the controls are not applied evenly, but I can assure Members that we are doing everything we can - I believe this is shown by the data - to provide a level playing field in enforcing the rules, irrespective of whether the operator is Spanish, Dutch, British or Irish.  This has led to the introduction of the electronic reporting system, as well as legislating for the weighing of fishery products, certification and verification of engine power, landing declarations, rules for sales notes and so on.  The EU regulations require financial sanctions to be at least five times the value of the fisheries products obtained in the committing of a serious infringement and at least eight times the value in the case of repeated serious infringements.  This proportionality requirement means that a fixed penalty notice would not meet EU requirements for serious infringements unless we were proposing to enforce massive fines, which clearly I do not believe is on the table.<\/p><p> The EU control regulation requires member states to implement a points system for serious offences.  The number of points that must be applied to the licence holder of a fishing vessel for each serious offence is set down and when the accumulated points reach a certain level, the licence for the fishing vessel is suspended or may potentially be permanently revoked.  I am finalising the arrangements for the introduction of the EU requirement for licence holders and have discussed them with the fishing industry.  The EU control regulation requires that a similar system be introduced in each member state for skippers of fishing vessels.  The regulation leaves it to member states to devise the scheme for skippers and, accordingly, I intend to bring forward legislation to implement this requirement.  I plan to combine legislation to deliver on this EU requirement with legislation to implement an on-the-spot fine system for minor fishery offences.<\/p><p> The proposed legislation involving on-the-spot fines will apply only to minor fishery offences.  I hope  we can secure support for such a system across party lines in the House because it is the right thing to do.  I would also like to secure industry support for this form of penalty for minor offences.  I have advised the industry, in general terms, of my intentions and so far have received a positive response.  I have asked my Department, in working with the Office of the Attorney General, to expedite the preparation of draft legislation to deliver on this approach.  It is my intention that the Bill will be prepared as soon as possible and following the receipt of detailed advice from the Attorney General.  I expect that the Bill will identify a finite range of fishery offences to which penalty notices for on-the-spot fines can be applied, having regard to such criteria as the benefit to the offender and repetition of the offence.<\/p> <p> I hope that, in the interest of trying to progress this issue politically, Fianna F&aacute;il Members will withdraw their Bill knowing that a Bill will be introduced within the next few months, which they will be able to scrutinise.  I have explained, probably in too much detail, why I cannot support the current legislation.  It is not legally sound, although I support the sentiment behind it.  We are working with the Attorney General to come up with legislation that is legally sound and that can ensure fishermen are not turned into criminals for minor fisheries offences while, at the same time, ensuring we have appropriate penalties for crimes in order that we have a level playing field and fishermen respect the rules under the new Common Fisheries Policy.  If we do not have that, we will have a free for all and nobody in the fishing industry wants that because as happened to cod in the Irish Sea, we will overfish it and spend decades trying to replenish stocks. <\/p><p>We have a good Common Fisheries Policy now which will be a challenge to implement but which will produce exciting results for the industry.  We will introduce, as we have committed to in the programme for Government, a system of fixed penalty notices for minor offences and I hope to introduce that legislation before Easter but certainly before the summer.  It is my intention to do so before Easter if I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700038#NN00700","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385569200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  The fishing industry at times is not overly represented in either House and by bringing the Bill forward, we are trying to highlight an anomaly that is undermining the industry and that needs to be rectified and legally clarified.  I fully acknowledge, as do my colleagues, that most sections in the 2006 legislation were accepted by the Labour Party and Fine Gael but they opposed the criminal provisions in it.  Senator O'Donovan introduced many amendments to the legislation but, unfortunately, the then Minister with the full backing of his civil servants was unwilling to change the criminal sanctions.  Politically, it was the wrong thing to do.  I blamed the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, at the time and I said it publicly on many occasions.  It was wrong then and it is wrong now but we are in opposition.<\/p><p>I was asked by Senator O'Donovan to examine this issue as my party's Seanad spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine.  This was my first opportunity to do so.  We consulted industry stakeholders and we introduced the Bill.  We have gone further than the Private Members' legislation introduced by Fine Gael in 2009 by providing for an appeals system.  The Bill may not be perfect and there may be constitutional issues that need to be addressed.  However, we do not have civil servants or the advice of the Attorney General to guide us when drafting legislation.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Minister's constructive contribution and his acknowledgement that there is a need to do something about this.  For example, the issue of a small fishing trawler facing the possibility of a criminal sanction for a minor offence while factory ships overfish needs to be addressed.  During our discussions, we met young fishermen who have left the sector because of the threat of criminal sanctions under this legislation.  We want to encourage young people into the industry and none of them should be faced with criminal sanction or be forced to leave the industry because of this.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for his constructive response.  I did not expect him to accept the Bill but I am grateful that at least he accepts the thrust of the legislation.  I very much look forward to the Government Bill and we will scrutinise it carefully because that is our job.  As the Minister mentioned, we did not highlight the specific measures to be covered under the penalty points system because that should be left to the discretion of the Minister of the day and his or her officials rather than a party in opposition.  It would be wrong for us to do that and that is why we left it up to the Minister in the Bill.  It is only right that he or she would draw up those tables.  It is up to him or her or the Department to decide by way of regulation or otherwise the severity of sanctions based on a penalty points system.  I look forward to this provision in the Government Bill.<\/p><p>Given the Minister's acceptance of where we are coming from, we will not divide the House on this Bill.  In opposition, we have a responsibility to scrutinise but we also have an obligation to be responsible and to try to work with the Government and merge into one lane to benefit an industry.  That is what we are trying to do.  It is not right to punish us as individuals for what happened in 2006.  I was not a Member of the House and Senator O'Donovan tried his best to amend the legislation at the time.  Those who were responsible may not be in either House now.  It would be grossly wrong of us not to do anything about it because of what we have said publicly and what was said in 2006.  This is a genuine effort to try to do something about it.  We will work with the Minister and if his Bill embraces the thrust of what we have proposed, he will have Fianna F&aacute;il's support for it.  I will withdraw my Bill based on the Minister's contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700041#QQ00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1385569200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I do not just refer to today or yesterday in the lead-up to the closing date, it is a case of weeks of frustration for me and constituents dealing with property tax issues.  One man paid his property tax this year on two properties, an apartment and a house.  He received his bill on 18 October for four times the amount he paid this year but based on one property.  He made contact with the helpline on 30 October, spent one hour on the telephone and was transferred to head office to sort out his query but the issue could not be resolved.  When he next went onto the website, it was indicated that his ID did not match his PPS number.  He followed up with an e-mail on 4 November.  He rang again on 8 November and a man called Daniel told him he would send an e-mail on his behalf, but there was no reply.  He rang the helpline again on 14 November.  He was informed that the waiting time to speak to someone in head office was at least 25 minutes.  The saga went on and on.  He eventually sent two e-mails and, as of today, has had no call-back, having been promised that would happen.  My office telephoned the helpline yesterday and asked someone to please ring him before close of business because he was getting frustrated.  He tried to make contact with the local property tax helpline and was told someone would get back to him, but as of today he has received no call-back.<\/p><p>This is only one person.  I have also had occasion to ring on behalf of clients.  The most typical problem is that people are being overcharged for their properties.  For some strange reason, the tax appears to have increased by four times the amount it was this year.  People cannot get an answer from the helpline as to what is going on.  They are told the matter must be dealt with by head office, but after holding for half an hour, they are told head office cannot deal with it either.  It is frustrating for the general public and everyone involved.  In one case, every time a woman tries to log on, she gets a message stating: &ldquo;Actions outstanding since 2013&rdquo;.  In the case of another person, I was told they had not paid the tax, despite the fact that I was able to provide the receipt number on the telephone.  Nobody involved in the helpline seems to be able to answer even the simplest of queries.  I do not know why there is a helpline because those involved are not able to answer queries.  I hope the Minister of State will say he can wave a magic wand and get the helpline working properly.<\/p><p>Another problem is that nobody can seem to get an answer as to what will happen if one does not identify by close of business tonight the way one will pay.  What will happen to such people and what penalties will be imposed on them?  Nobody will answer such queries.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and will comment further at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700042#RR00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1385569800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am very much aware of the frustration to which she refers.  It is an issue that has been raised with me by my constituents.  First, we must acknowledge how difficult it is for so many people to pay the tax.  It is an entirely new category of taxation that represents a gigantic change from where we were before the crisis.  With both of these points in mind, we must make it easy for people to deal and engage with the system, given that the vast majority want to pay.  That is something that should be and is very important to the Government and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>Owing to the scale of the change introduced, it has prompted a huge response from the public as people seek to engage with the tax and understand their liability.  The vast majority have been willing to pay the property tax.  Revenue has answered in excess of 700,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 200,000 letters or e-mails since March.  It has taken LPT from being a concept to a fully functioning tax in a short period, including the enactment of legislation, the construction of a brand new property register and the provision of a customer service for such a large volume of taxpayers.  I am further advised that because the LPT is a new tax it is difficult to anticipate service volumes and, as a consequence, the number of agents required.<\/p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that exceptional delays in accessing the helpline, the primary contact point for LPT queries, were experienced by some callers in the days immediately following the issue of the 2014 notifications, in late October and early November.  I expect that was the cause of at least some of the difficulties to which the Senator referred.  Access was also hampered on an intermittent basis on those days by technical issues with the service provider's telephony system which have since been resolved.<\/p><p>In response to the demand for service, Revenue ensured significant extra resources were deployed to the helpline within two days of the peak period and also deployed extra resources to its own internal support service to cater for the more complex queries.  Contingency plans have also been put in place to further rapidly increase the number of agents on the helpline should it be necessary to do so.  In total, there are now 310 agents fully deployed to the LPT telephone call-handling service.  In addition to the extra staff deployed, callers can now leave their telephone contact details on the system during busy periods in preference to waiting for service and will receive an out-of-hours call-back from the LPT team.  Revenue also extended the helpline opening hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. from 6 to 14 November and has recommenced the extended hours for the peak filing period from 25 to 29 November, inclusive.  It also extended the paper filing date by one week to 14 November to allow people additional time to arrange their 2014 payment method.  The combined initiatives of additional deployments, extended opening hours and the extended paper deadline have already significantly reduced waiting times on the helpline and I am assured that even further resources will be made available should they be required.<\/p><p>The dedicated helpline to which the Senator refers is operated by a private sector call service company, Abtran.  While every effort is made to assist the public in complying with their LPT obligations, Revenue observes strict data protection standards and is obliged to maintain and protect the integrity of internal confidential records.  For that reason, the queries handled by Abtran include information on general aspects of all areas of the LPT, including payment methods, valuations, exemptions and deferrals.  The external helpline also provides an online filing service to those wishing to file their returns and payments by telephone, provided the person requiring assistance has his or her property ID and PIN numbers to hand.  Callers inquiring about their property register records or payment records must be transferred to the internal Revenue helpline in order that their records can be accessed and amended, if necessary.  Likewise, if a person contacting the helpline does not have his or her property ID and PIN number available, he or she is referred to the internal helpline for assistance.<\/p> <p>Again, the protection of data is paramount and Revenue has to ensure that property IDs and PINs are distributed securely.<\/p><p>The Senator also mentioned that wrong payments cannot be handled by the external helpline.  This scenario usually occurs on foot of an incorrect property valuation.  Persons wishing to change their declared property valuations are required to submit a request directly to Revenue together with supporting evidence and documentation.<\/p><p>I am advised that every effort has been made by Revenue to deal with the current high volume of calls.  During the period from 24 October to 19 November 2013, Abtran handled 117,170 calls and the internal Revenue helpline handled 25,895 calls.  Given the scale of the local property tax, LPT, operation and the level of demand for service around filing dates, it is inevitable that some delays are experienced in accessing services.<\/p><p>A key aspect of the service provided by Abtran is the flexibility to scale resources up and down in response to demand.  With effect from mid-October there was a requirement to increase capacity to handle calls in regard to the 2014 filing dates and the number of agents engaged increased incrementally to the current levels.  The number of agents employed was further increased this week to support the online filing date of 27 November.  The number of Revenue staff engaged in the internal helpline increases in line with the external service staffing levels. Up to 80 Revenue staff members are now assigned to support the internal helpline and further contingency arrangements are in place for the filing date of 27 November.<\/p><p>Revenue has worked to reduce call waiting times.  The average waiting time during October 2013 for the external helpline was six minutes and I am advised that the average waiting time for the external helpline is currently less than one minute.  On peak filing days the average waiting time for the internal helpline was 15 to 18 minutes with longer waiting times occurring occasionally, while the waiting time for the internal helpline is currently averaging nine minutes.  The longer waiting time for the internal service is directly related to the complexity of the issues raised by callers and to Revenue's commitment to resolve the issues and to fully satisfy the callers' requirements.  I can confirm that callers were asked to call back at a later time during the peak filing period of 13, 14 and 15 November only.  The call service was available until 8 p.m. on these dates and callers were advised to call later to avail of shorter waiting times for the internal helpline.  The facility to leave a message requesting call-back from Revenue is also made available on a daily basis, particularly during busy periods.<\/p><p>I  acknowledge the work done by the Revenue Commissioners in taking the LPT from concept to a fully functioning tax in such a short period of time, including the enacting of legislation, the building of a brand new property register, the provision of customer service to such a large volume of taxpayers and, crucially, the contribution of &euro;215 million to date to the Exchequer.  I also want to acknowledge, as I did at the outset, the great number of people who, despite the massive difficulty they face in their daily lives, have paid this new form of taxation.  That has been difficult for many people.  While this tax represents a major change in our tax system it has allowed us to ensure that further tax is not imposed on income and on work and that we can continue to build on our efforts to ensure our economy recovers.  I emphasise that this has difficult for many people and acknowledge the difficulty they have gone through in paying this tax, and the other difficulties that I outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700042#RR00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385570400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

In updating her on the average waiting a number of people had to persist with to pay this tax which is difficult for them to pay, I do not believe it is acceptable that they should have to wait for 18 minutes for a response to their query or for their call to be answered, although I can understand the reason, at times, it takes a long time to resolve what can be difficult and complicated issues.  On foot of the long waiting times that have developed, I emphasise, as set out in my reply, that the Revenue Commissioners have responded to them by putting in place extra resources and changing, where possible, the way in which matters are being dealt with.<\/p><p>On the Senator's request for an extension of the local property tax online filing deadline, I confirm that earlier today the Revenue Commissioners made an announcement on that on foot of a number of people like the Senator who have raised this issue.  They communicated that due to the exceptional level of filing over the past two days and the unprecedented number of calls to the local property tax helpline, they have decided, as they did last May, to extend the local property tax filing deadline.  Property owners now have until 5 p.m. on Friday evening to file their 2014 LPT return.  This will still allow Revenue time to implement the individual's preferred LPT payment option for 2014.  This helpline will be open from 8 a.m to 8 p.m. today and tomorrow and from 8 a.m. on Friday, 29 November.  As was the practice last May, any taxpayer who has submitted a genuine query, whether by e-mail, letter or voicemail, to the helpline in respect of their 2014 obligations in advance of the filing date, will be treated as having complied with his or her requirements on time.  I emphasise that point. <\/p><p>Having regard to the significant change that this tax represents to our tax code, if taxpayers have put in place a genuine query in advance of the filing date, this will be treated as having complied with their requirements.  For this treatment to apply, however, they must file their return promptly when the query is resolved.  <\/p><p>The Senator sought that the deadline be extended for a longer than that indicated but this change has been made on foot of the issues that the Senator and other colleagues have raised.  We recognise the degree of complexity involved and the difficulty it is causing people.  However, a great number of people have complied with it.  The contribution it is making ti supporting our national finances is immense and that is recognised by the information that I have confirmed to the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700043#SS00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1385570400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I think Senator Moloney will be happy enough with that reply.

I have raised this issue three times on the Adjournment, including with the Minister of State as far back as 2011.  We have, therefore, discussed the issue many times and the Minister of State will be aware of the background.  Commitments were given by the previous Government in 2011 not only to build a palliative care unit but also a full oncology unit on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital, which would have provide a multidisciplinary unit covering all modalities of cancer care under one roof.  It was estimated at the time that it would cost approximately &euro;70 million.  Capital funding was not available but the Government gave a commitment to at least proceed with the palliative care unit through matching funding from the local hospice and the local community.<\/p><p>I am seeking an update about the project.  I accept that members of all parties and none would like this project to be built as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, the south east is one of the few areas that does not have a dedicated specialist palliative care unit.  There are four community home care specialist palliative care teams with consultant leads but while the teams do fantastic work, they need in-house facilities for those who cannot be cared for at home.  The population of counties Cork and Kerry is 510,000 but the area has 24 specialist palliative care beds while the south east with a population of 463,000 has access to two inpatient beds.  Some 1,300 patients in the area are seen by the specialist community teams with 850 patients seen in acute hospitals.  I am sure they receive fantastic care and treatment.<\/p><p>We need this palliative care unit.  Advances were made and there seemed to be progress on the previous occasion I raised the issue but the project has still not been finalised.  Will the Minister of State update the House on the current position and how quickly this will be delivered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700044#TT00100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1385571000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  He is correct that palliative care is an issue on which there is no disagreement among individual public representatives or political parties.  Cork has always been well served by both the hospice movement and palliative care teams and we consider ourselves fortunate in this regard.<\/p><p>  However, the financial constraints, which have unavoidably applied to all sectors of government, including the health sector, over the last five years have meant that the development of palliative care has advanced at a slower pace than we wished.  Notwithstanding current budgetary difficulties, a great deal of good work has been done over the past number of years to improve what we can provide and this will continue.  There is good co-operation and engagement between the HSE and voluntary organisations and there is ongoing engagement with voluntary hospice organisations in counties Waterford, Kerry, Wicklow, Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, the midlands and Blanchardstown to address gaps in service provision.<\/p><p>  The HSE's clinical care programme for palliative care is working with acute services, services for older people, mental health services, community services and paediatric services on a range of initiatives to give patients access to palliative care no matter what part of the health services they engage with.  The HSE performance report for 2013 indicates that up to June 2013, 94% of those seeking specialist palliative inpatient beds received this service within seven days and 99% received the service within one month.  In 2010, the <i>Economist<\/i> Intelligence Unit ranked Ireland as having the fourth best developed palliative care service out of the 40 countries surveyed.  The objective always is to respond to the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of patients and to achieve the best quality of life for the patient and family.  The ultimate aim is to make sure that patients get the right care, at the right time, by the right team, regardless of where they are being cared for.  It is my objective that this philosophy will be applied across all care settings in order that all people will get the palliative care that they need regardless of their age and of whether they die in a hospice, an acute hospital or at home. <\/p><p>  The HSE is progressing the development of the specialist palliative care inpatient unit on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital in partnership with Waterford Hospice Movement.  The unit is one element of the overall capital project for the site which will comprise 20 specialist palliative care inpatient beds, palliative day care, therapy and associated accommodation.  There will be three wards of 24 single rooms.  Arrangements are being put in place to fund this project in order that all capital costs are covered, including construction cost, design fees, equipping, etc.  The Waterford Hospice Movement is also endeavouring to make a significant contribution towards the palliative care element of this project.  At this stage, it would not be appropriate to release specific figures as contracts are not yet signed and this is, therefore, commercially sensitive.  The enabling works for this development are being progressed.  It is expected that the design team will be appointed in early 2014 and it is anticipated that construction will commence in early 2015.  It is hoped that the new Waterford hospice will be operational by 2018.  This is good news but we need to keep an eye on progress to make sure the project remains on track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700044#TT00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1385571000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said the design team will be appointed next year, construction will begin in 2015 and the unit will be fully operational by 2018.

I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  The gist of the motion is that I was contacted by Slane Community Forum and Slane Local Heroes about the Slane Hub.  It is an office which serves a multi-function purpose.  It is a meeting point and an information point for the community and tourists.  The Slane Hub developed from the Local Heroes initiative begun around the country by our colleague, Senator Quinn.  The Slane Local Heroes initiative has been one of the more successful ones.  It is fair to say that since it got up and running the village has transformed from every point of view.  It looks fabulous and there is a great community spirit, which always existed but has been very much enhanced, and more tourists are coming to the town as well.  The Slane Community Forum won a runner-up prize at the national Pride of Place event held in Belfast.  It was joint runner-up with the New Ross Quayside Redevelopment.  In this particular year that is an indication of the calibre of the community in Slane and the tourism product it offers.  The special award was for a tourism diaspora initiative.  Great efforts are being made to attract members of the diaspora to Slane.  My colleague, Councillor Wayne Harding, organised a gathering for former workers of the mill in Slane.  That was one of the very successful initiatives this year which brought some people home from abroad for the project.<\/p><p>The Slane Hub has applied to Tourism Ireland to be registered as an official tourist office.  Unusually, as I understand it, they are not looking for funding.  They just want the official designation to be featured on the website and to be automatically included in information provided to tourists.  The office is up and running and people are doing a fabulous job already in providing significant tourism information to people.  It would enhance the service provided immensely, and it would enhance the status of the village of Slane, if the office were designated as an official tourist office.  Approaches were made to Bord F&aacute;ilte and they were somewhat rebuffed and told that it could not happen.  I felt it was a case of bureaucracy gone a little wrong.  The Slane Hub is offering something to the State and the State should be grateful as it will only enhance the tourism product of the village, region, county and country.  I urge the Minister of State to be practical and to accede to the request which I understand will be at no cost to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700045#UU00100","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1385571600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I congratulate the community in Slane on its recent award and for supporting The Gathering, which was so successful.  I was in Meath recently and am aware of its many tourism attractions.  It is an area that could be further developed with the co-operation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the local community.  It is a beautiful county with much history.  We could do more to promote it.  I am delighted to see such a group coming together that is aware of the attractions in its area.<\/p><p>I am pleased to attend the Seanad today to clarify matters for Senator Byrne and the Slane Community Forum in regard to the designation of the Slane Hub as an official F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourist office.  At the outset I would like to advise Senators that the operation of tourist information offices is a day-to-day operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland itself.  The management and staffing of the offices, their opening hours and locations are administrative and operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its management.<\/p><p>Given the pressure on the public finances and in response to changes in the needs of tourists, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, like many other State agencies, continues to reconfigure service delivery, reshape its services and prioritise the locations where tourism information offices are provided.  As part of that, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working in partnership with local communities, where possible, in the provision of tourist information by local groups and businesses.  Indeed, during 2011 and 2012, F&aacute;ilte Ireland established a good track record in that regard, when co\u00adoperation with local communities ensured that many tourist information offices that might otherwise have closed remained open.<\/p><p>It is pleasing to see many communities taking responsibility for the operation of their local tourist information offices across the country.  To date, approximately 40% of these offices have been taken over by local authorities, chambers of commerce and community groups.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland currently licences approximately 50 such businesses across the country to operate as visitor information points.  In addition to providing supports through free literature provision, training and a mentor contact person, F&aacute;ilte Ireland also monitors service provision at the offices through agreed key performance indicators.  The visitor information points run by local interests are the subject of an operational or quality agreement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The agreement entitles a local office to carry the F&aacute;ilte Ireland logo as a mark of the standard it has received to provide assurance to consumers and tourists.  I wish to emphasise that F&aacute;ilte Ireland works in partnership with local authorities and communities on this issue.  Decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis in consultation with interested local groups.<\/p><p>As it stands, F&aacute;ilte Ireland already partners with and provides support to a number of tourist offices in County Meath, while conducting an ongoing review of allocation of resources to its tourist office network operations.  I understand there has been ongoing communication between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Slane Community Forum and Meath &amp;amp; Boyne Valley Tourism regarding tourism office designation for the Slane Hub premises.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland advise me that a request was received on the 19 November 2013 from Slane Community Forum applying for and seeking details on the application process for designation as an approved F&aacute;ilte Ireland visitor information point.  I am pleased to advise the Senator that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is examining the submission and will be in touch with the forum in the coming days to discuss the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700045#UU00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1385571600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I am pleased the Minister of State has given a positive response.

I have been in contact with the forum on the matter for some time.  The forum has been rebuffed for a number of reasons.  One is due to the location of a tourist office 13 km away in Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  That is not correct, but in any event, even if it were there, they are two separate and distinct offices and there is no cost to the State.

I am delighted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is present as the matter is directed to him.  It is in all our interests to proceed in a sure-footed manner when managing the public purse.  In view of our expected exit from the bailout, I wish to ask the Minister whether he would consider amending the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to require a statement each year or a report to be laid before the Oireachtas regarding first, the contingent liabilities of the State based on current policies, including pensions and guarantees, and second, the policy measures needed to live within the expenditure caps the Government has set for future years.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister for Finance to provide a transparent roadmap for the Oireachtas and the general public that will show the impact of Cabinet and Government decisions on our finances and that such a roadmap would be laid before the Oireachtas each year.  Such a report would give us a better idea of the impact of policy changes and proposed reduced budgets.  We are well aware there is always a price to be paid and trade-offs to be made for changes in policy.  The reform process in which the Government is engaged is not adequately designed at present because it is not transparent.<\/p> <p> I have the IMF document from July 2013 here and in regard to Ireland's fiscal transparency assessment it clarifies specifically that Ireland needs a statement of fiscal risks that will cover contingent liabilities as well as pensions and guarantees.  As the Minister knows, a contingent liability may be something such as a liability for a toll road, where if enough cars do not use it, the State will have to pay a certain amount to make up the difference.  Another example might be the deposit guarantee scheme, although it is not considered a contingent liability currently because of its legal form.  However, like the insurance fund, if the State had to pay, it would have to levy other depositors.  Therefore, the deposit guarantee is essentially a contingent liability, because if it was required, the State would have to raise the revenue to pay out.  The IMF states this clearly in Table 3.3. Ireland: Selected Contingent Liabilities of General Government, 2011\/12. <\/p><p>My motion requests an annual statement of these contingent liabilities to be laid before the House.  Some contingency liabilities are listed in the stability programme update, but other similar liabilities, such as the examples I have given, are not listed.  Thus, we have an incomplete picture.  The IMF recommends a comprehensive statement of fiscal risks, including more information on these liabilities.  While I welcome the exit of the IMF, we should learn from its advice so that our nation never repeats its mistakes.  We should be committed to reforming practices so as to improve practice at Civil Service, ministerial, public transparency and accountancy level.<\/p><p>My second request is that an annual statement outlining the policy measures required for us to live within the expenditure caps will be set out by the Government for future years.  The Government announces expenditure limits in the budget each year.  However, it does not give the figures on estimated expenditure.  The amendment I would request from the Minister would produce two sets of figures.  For example, it would produce the expenditure levels for 2015 and 2016 with no policy change and also the expenditure caps as proposed by the Government for those years which would assume some specified or unspecified policy changes.  The Oireachtas could then see the gap between option one and two and could debate the policy options for bridging those gaps in a meaningful and timely way.  The Members, who have been elected by the public, could then have some say and could come up with ideas that could influence the final shape of the choices made.  This would give Oireachtas Members more ownership of the process.  This would be much better than the current situation, where policy choices are frequently concealed from the Oireachtas until after the Government has irrevocably made up its mind and the Oireachtas is then obliged to adopt those decisions on a take it or leave it basis.<\/p><p>EU Directive 2011\/85\/EU recommends that the Government spell out this no policy change scenario, but as things stand, the Government is not doing this adequately transparently.  As the Minister can see, the Government is obliged to do some of what I am requesting by the end of 2013, but it has not done so yet.  Will the Government amend the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 in this regard to meet these commitments on an annual basis?  The current budgetary process and forecasting would then, therefore, be more transparent and more useful to the Oireachtas and the general public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700045#UU00600","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385572200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Healy Eames for her very interesting contribution, which was a little different from the matter notified to my Department.  I will deal with my prepared response first and then address what she has said.<\/p><p>I have no plans to amend the Fiscal Responsibility Act as suggested by the Senator as there is no need to do so for the following reasons.  With regard to the first statement she seeks, regarding contingent liabilities, I am sure she is aware that statement 1.11 in the 2012 finance accounts sets out amounts that have been guaranteed by the Minister for Finance under various statutes, and where a pay-out under such a guarantee would be a direct charge on the Central Fund.  The Senator should also be aware that in recent years, the finance accounts have also included a footnote to statement 1.10 on the State's pension liability in respect of the occupational pension schemes of public servants.  The &euro;116 billion figure set out in the 2012 finance accounts for this pension liability was compiled in 2009.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has commenced work on an exercise to update the accrued liability figure in line with a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is intended to have an estimate of the new figure by early 2014.<\/p><p>On the issue of State pensions, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 makes provision for the carrying out of actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund every five years.  The most recent one was published in June 2012 and is available on the Department of Social Protection's website.<\/p><p>The Senator probably knows that the six-pack reforms adopted in 2011 by the EU included the legal requirement for member states to report annually on: the outstanding amount of government guarantees; the liabilities of public corporations; off balance sheet PPPs; non-performing loans; and the participation of government in the capital of corporations.  Some of these requirements are already met in the finance accounts and Central Statistics Office publications and the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office will ensure that all these requirements are met in full.<\/p><p>Finally on this point, separate to the EU-IMF programme, the IMF carried out a fiscal transparency assessment, which was published in July 2013.  The Government established a steering group, under the supervision of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to implement, as appropriate, the actions detailed in the IMF assessment.  The steering group has commenced work and this should lead to better presentation of contingent liabilities in the future.<\/p><p>I will now address the second statement that the Senator suggests should be a legislative requirement.  The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014, published in December 2011, introduced the medium-term expenditure framework.  This new framework allows for structural, medium-term planning and prioritisation within each area of spending, with full public input and parliamentary oversight.  A key feature of the new framework was the introduction of multi-annual Ministerial expenditure ceilings that are set on a nominal gross expenditure basis and operate as upper limits on expenditure for each year within a three-year period.  The ceilings operated on an administrative basis until July 2013 when the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013 put the multi-annual ceilings on a statutory footing, ensuring that this reform is now a permanent structural feature of Ireland's budgetary framework.  The ceilings are set out on a rolling three-year basis and each year, the three-year frame of reference for the expenditure framework will be extended to include a new, outer year.  The Act is fully consistent with the EU budgetary frameworks directive and ensures that the multi-annual ceilings are binding over the three-year period.<\/p><p>An administrative circular was published in September 2013 setting out the rules and operational arrangements for the workings of the Government and departmental ceilings.  The circular sets out specified limited circumstances under which the ceilings may be varied and the rules have been set to specifically ensure that any variations to the ceilings are compliant with the overall European and national fiscal rules.  Furthermore, the circular sets out a number of mechanisms designed to incentivise Departments to adhere to the expenditure ceilings, including: current expenditure carryover which will in future years allow the carryover of unspent current funds from one year to increase the current expenditure ceilings for the next year - this will be subject to a number of safeguards and technical conditions; and sanction mechanisms which will deal with cases where ceilings have not been observed.<\/p><p>The first comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE, took place in 2011 and set out recommendations for making savings that informed subsequent budgets.  The next CRE process will begin in the coming months and will be led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All Departments will be required to co-operate and prioritise key areas of spending for the coming years.  The CRE involves a line-by-line examination of current expenditure across all departmental expenditure programmes.  It will set out Government priorities and policies and it will be drafted in full compliance with the Government and ministerial expenditure ceilings.<\/p> <p>I hope the Senator understands why I do not agree it is necessary to amend the legislation in question as the matters to which she referred are covered by law.  I understand why she has raised the matter.  It is important full information on the issue be provided for the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the public.  If we were debating this issue last June, the Senator&rsquo;s suggestions would be correct.  However, significant progress was made in July and September and we have caught up with the issues which she has raised.  The book of Estimates is published every year and shows the annual allocations to each sector.  With the Budget Statement in October, the Estimates debate will take place between the months of October and December rather than June the following year when half of the moneys will already have been spent.  The Senator is in the same space as we are, but we have made the legislative changes.  The next issue is that the material published be not only comprehensive but also user-friendly in order that people will not get bogged down in statistics that are hard to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112700046#VV00200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385572800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.
