Brexit is one of my top priorities and was central to my decision-making on the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2 million in current and &euro;65 million in capital funding I secured as part of budget 2019.  For example, I provided an additional &euro;5 million to the local enterprise offices, LEOs, &euro;3 million to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2 million to IDA Ireland, &euro;1 million to InterTrade Ireland, ITI, and extra staff for regulatory bodies of my Department to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the new future growth longer-term loan scheme and the new IDA Ireland regional property programme.<\/p><p>The &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, which was launched in March 2018, provides working capital facility of one to three years to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.<\/p><p>The future growth loan scheme was announced in budget 2019.  Its purpose is to provide a longer-term facility of eight to ten years in order to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment.  This &euro;300 million scheme is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Loans of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;3 million will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.<\/p><p>In May 2018, the rescue and restructuring scheme was extended to include temporary restructuring support for those enterprises with acute liquidity needs.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland, EI, has established additional supports including a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, an online Brexit SME scorecard, a Be Prepared grant and a new eurozone strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.  In addition, the agile innovation fund provides up to 50% in support up to &euro;300,000.  EI also recently launched a customs insights online training course to help all businesses understand how customs work.<\/p><p>To help build the enterprise capability under the regional enterprise development fund, EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region, with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>As part of budget 2019 I also allocated an additional &euro;10 million to the IDA Ireland regional property programme, which will prioritise investment in the Border region, with new advanced units to be built in Dundalk, Monaghan and Sligo.<\/p><p>The ITI Brexit advisory service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-Border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit.  ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.  To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit advisory service.<\/p><p>ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme worth up to &euro;2,250, which enables businesses to obtain professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, with advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.<\/p><p>The LEOs are the first stop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing a business.  They have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit.  In addition, 402 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring focused solely on Brexit.<\/p><p>The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit, including technical assistance grants for micro-export, which are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities.  Furthermore, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p><p>The majority of these schemes are open to all SMEs and not just EI agency clients.<\/p><p>On state aid, in November 2017, a technical working group was established, comprising representatives from the Directorate General for Competition in the European Commission, my Department, EI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises affected by Brexit in line with state aid rules.<\/p><p>Much has been achieved by the working group, including the development of the future growth loan scheme and the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s rescue-and-restructuring scheme to include temporary liquidity aid.

It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner&rsquo;s team in addressing any state aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implications become known.

On 19 December, the Government published our contingency action plan, which outlines our approach to no-deal Brexit planning.  As part of that plan, the Government last week published the general scheme of a Bill that would be necessary in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The draft omnibus Bill - the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill - focuses on measures protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as my Department is concerned, Part 3 of the omnibus Bill consists of nine heads containing legislative provisions relevant to functions under my Department.  They are aimed at improving the range of supports offered by Enterprise Ireland to help companies face the challenges of Brexit and remain competitive at a global level.  Specifically, the intention is to increase the ability of Enterprise Ireland to provide a competitive and flexible offering to its client companies in terms of research and development grants and to allow it to provide low-interest debt instruments.<\/p>  <p>  In increasing Enterprise Ireland's power to provide lending supports to businesses, we are helping to preserve the value of the State's investments in these businesses and assisting companies through restructuring or redevelopment programmes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the legislative provisions contained in the omnibus Bill, my Department is progressing six statutory instruments that are also required to deal with Brexit.  These are largely technical in nature to effect necessary changes in different policy areas: health and safety; company law; and the export of dual-use goods.  These legislative changes are part of a wider suite of measures, both legislative and non-legislative, being undertaken by my Department to prepare for Brexit, including the deployment of new business supports, additional funding to the agencies and regulatory bodies, engagement with the European Commission on state aid issues, and ongoing direct engagement with business representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100004#B00800","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1548931200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am puzzled by that response.

When I examined the section of the Bill relating to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, though, it became obvious that it was not new.  In fact, it is a copy-and-paste job of the Industrial Development (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2018, which the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation had sight of in October.  I appreciate that such provisions will assist our enterprise agencies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but these amendments to the Industrial Development Acts were not designed or drawn up in the past few months in preparation for a hard Brexit.  They were on the way regardless.

This figure includes &euro;24.8 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Through SFI, Department has also commenced the roll-out of a new &euro;100 million programme of investment in PhDs and research masters through new centres for research training.  We are investigating the roll-out of a new tranche of PRTLI funding currently but the Department will not be found wanting in respect of investment in the research and development infrastructure of our universities and institutes of technology.  We are making that investment.  Since 2012, there has been a dramatic increase in the amount we have put into research equipment, universities and institutes of technology, including increases in 2016 and 2017.  We will continue to put that money in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100005#C00800","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","time":1548931800,"counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100005#C00850"},{"type":"question","time":1548931800,"counter":39,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[4872\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100005#C00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the analysis undertaken on the effect on businesses here if in the event of a no-deal Brexit border controls were implemented in continental ports checking goods arriving from Ireland; and the measures she has considered to mitigate the negative impact on business here.","asker":"1294","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1548931800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am interested in a specific aspect of what might happen if there was to be a no-deal Brexit.

My Department has conducted extensive research on a wide range of issues affecting businesses with regard to Brexit.  In February 2018, my Department published an independent expert study undertaken by Copenhagen Economics entitled, \"Ireland and the Impact of Brexit\".  This study examined the implications of Brexit for the economy and trade and quantified the impact of new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit.  The suite of Brexit supports that have been put in place for businesses through the enterprise agencies under my Department's remit\u00a0have been informed by this report\u00a0as well as\u00a0other studies and analysis undertaken across government. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to exports moving directly from Ireland to\u00a0continental Europe, Brexit will have no impact in terms of new or additional customs controls; the Single Market will continue to apply.  For goods transiting through the UK using the landbridge, there may be implications as a result of a no-deal Brexit.  To facilitate the import and export of goods, the Government&rsquo;s preparedness and contingency planning for Brexit has, from the start, included issues relating to the continued effective use of the UK landbridge.  This is a priority for the Government given its importance for exporters and importers as a means of access to the rest of the Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  Issues relating to the optimal arrangements and necessary infrastructure for customs and related inspections at ports and airports are primarily matters for the Revenue Commissioners and for my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance\u00a0and Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>Retaining the effective use of the land bridge post-Brexit has been discussed at both political and official level with both the UK and the EU.  As a result of these contacts, the importance of maintaining the land bridge has been recognised through the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft withdrawal agreement, which reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU member state or another country, or vice versa.  In a no deal scenario, however, it is anticipated that the land bridge, at least in the initial period, may be subject to delays.

That all sounds great but it does not address the fact that there are very serious shortcomings and mistakes on the part of two other State bodies that do not suffer from funding difficulties, namely An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the DPP.

This was a complex case.  Many positive steps have been taken by the office since then.  In 2008, for example, the ODCE had no forensic accountants or digital forensic expertise.

There is no quick-fix available for this issue.  The senior Minister and I cannot stand up in the House and say that we will bring down the cost of insurance within two or three months.  However, I believe that the recommendations in the two reports, the input of the various Departments that are dealing with this, and the second phase of the report of the PIC, when implemented, will mean that, in the medium term, insurance companies will have no choice but to bring down the cost of insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100008#F00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","time":1548933600,"counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100008#F00300"},{"type":"question","time":1548933600,"counter":73,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[4434\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100008#F00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to protect business along the Border in view of Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1548933600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>What are the plans of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to protect businesses along the Border in view of Brexit?

However, I will do my best to reply.  Regional development is a key priority for my Department.  We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment throughout the country.  My Department and its agencies have been working hard towards that goal.  Significant progress has already been made with 58% of all IDA Ireland client-supported employment now located outside of Dublin.  This figure is the highest ever in the history of the agency.  Our aim is to increase this percentage further in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA Ireland's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment, FDI.  Not only does such a supply of properties help the agency to secure high-quality jobs, it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.  It, therefore, remains an important means by which IDA Ireland can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland.  IDA Ireland currently owns 29 properties.  Of these, 14 are occupied by IDA Ireland clients.  The remainder are available for prospective or existing investors.  I will provide the Deputy with a table setting out the location of these various properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100010#H00800","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1548934800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>It appears that there is a continuation of a two-tier approach to regional job creation in respect of IDA Ireland site visits up to quarter 3 of 2018.  The trend of over-concentration of IDA Ireland site visits on the eastern seaboard remains unchanged, with nearly one in every two taking place in the region.  Out of a total number of 461 visits nationwide in the first nine months of 2018, 45% were to the capital city.  During the same period, eight counties, including Longford, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny, received three visits or fewer.  I was very concerned about the figures relating to County Wexford, particularly in light of the fact that Rosslare is located there.  This is a concern.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the two regions to which I refer continue to struggle in the context of job creation.

In the south east, particularly Waterford, Cork and Wexford, IDA Ireland has the same opportunities to meet client companies and advise them as to suitable locations to establish operations and about areas that have competent workforces, a good quality of life and the necessary infrastructure.  Ultimately, however, the companies make the decisions and we cannot force or cajole them and say \"Oh please don't locate in Dublin.  Please come down to Waterford\".  As much as the Deputy and I would like to see companies setting up in Waterford and as other Deputies would like to see them in their regions, it must be accepted that IDA Ireland offers the same facilities all over the country to encourage FDI companies to set up in the regions.

There is a large concentration of the population in the capital but, unfortunately, out of the total number of jobs created by IDA Ireland in all counties with cities, Waterford fared the worst, with only 471 jobs created there last year while 1,458 were created in Limerick, 1,971 in Galway and 3,177 in Cork.  It is disappointing that three times the number of jobs created in Waterford, the constituency I represent, are being created in other cities.

In the past four years, 44,000 FDI-driven jobs have been created outside Dublin.  Again, I emphasise that all of us in the regions and the Government want to see things moving out of the capital.

Regional development, not just in the Border area but across Ireland, remains a key priority and my Department and its agencies are focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country.  The recent annual results of the IDA demonstrate that we are making significant strides.  In 2018, for example, 56% of all new jobs created by the agency were in locations outside Dublin.  Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the Border region, posted net gains in jobs last year.  There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital.  In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin.  This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the agency's history.

We want the Labour Court to do its job and work with management and Government and with nursing unions to make recommendations as a basis for a way forward that can avoid the impact of strike action for two days next week.

The Government is sincere about that but we have to do it within the parameters the Taoiseach has outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100012#K00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1548936000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The exorbitant cost of the national children's hospital is going to have a serious impact on the delivery and progression of other projects over the next number of years, and that much has been confirmed by the Minister for Health and the Department.  Despite the massive implications, nobody involved in the process appears to want to take any responsibility.  It seems the Government has set its face against any statutory review by either the Comptroller and Auditor General, as was hinted at by one of the T&aacute;naiste's ministerial colleagues recently, or any other State organ.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, whose job it is to supervise procurement and public expenditure, is still refusing to appear before the Joint Committee on Health to account for his Department's role in the process.  The Minister for Health, for his part, and the Department are hiding behind the review of the process being conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers at a cost of &euro;450,000 in taxpayer's money, to add insult to injury.<\/p>  <p>  At at meeting of the Joint Committee on Health on 16 January, Mr. Tom Costello, chair of the board of the national children's hospital, said: \"If we were to start again on a project of this scale and complexity we would adopt [exactly] the same procurement approach.\"  That seems to be a head-in-the-sand approach.<\/p><p>No lessons have been learnt.  Nothing is going to change and the taxpayer simply has to get on with it.  What we need to know is what projects will be affected.  At the Committee of Public Accounts this morning I put it to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Jim Breslin, whether a number of projects, including the second cath lab for Waterford, are under consideration.  That funding was promised to Waterford Oireachtas Members and regional Oireachtas Members.  There is a raft of capital projects which we now understand is under consideration.  We were told that money was guaranteed and yet today at the Committee of Public Accounts the Secretary General of the Department of Health said it had not been signed off on and it is under review.  It is one of a number of capital projects that is under review by the Department.  Other projects affected are the new MRI scanner at Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar; the upgrade to wards in Cavan hospital; the national radiation oncology programme in the T&aacute;naiste's county of Cork; and the second cath lab in Waterford.  We need straight answers.  Only a few minutes ago the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, said in my ear that the Minister had said the project was safe.  Which is it?  We had the Secretary General at the Committee of Public Accounts telling us it was under consideration and a local Minister of State saying the funding is secure.  There will be victims and casualties as a result of the massive overrun.  Services will be cut, capital projects may not go ahead and the T&aacute;naiste must spell out very clearly to people across the State, either in Mullingar, Cork, Waterford or wherever else, which capital projects are under consideration and not signed off on and which are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100012#K00800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548936600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health has made it very clear that he is committed to the second cath lab in Waterford.  It is part of the service plan for 2019.  The Taoiseach has said very clearly that the funding challenges in relation to the national children's hospital will not result in the cancellation of any commitments that have been made.  In the nature of capital expenditure, as others in this House who have been involved in significant capital expenditure management linked to Government are aware, there may well be delays and space to ensure that the extra &euro;100 million or so - half of which is in the Department of Health - that is linked to the increased cost of the national children's hospital this year, can be found by delays that may happen in relation to other big capital expenditure projects.  We are spending billions of euro this year on capital expenditure.  Capital expenditure is up by 25% on last year.  I reassure people that we are not going to cancel other projects that have capital commitment, but the scheduling of payments for some of those projects that may be affected by means of enforced delays through planning or permitting systems or other delays will be looked at in order to create the space and the funding to facilitate the increased cost of the national children's hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the PwC review, the Government is committed to doing an independent and thorough investigation into the process and how the estimated expenditure of delivering the hospital increased as it did, so that we can learn lessons from that to make sure that when we spend a committed &euro;116 billion of capital expenditure over the next ten years we ensure that projects are kept within budget and that we do it in a way that is transparent and open.  When PwC finalises its report it will be published so that we learn lessons from it.  Many public projects are coming in on time and within budget.  The national children's hospital is a project that we need to learn lessons from and that is the whole point of getting an independent piece of professional work done, which I accept costs money, but in the context of the overall cost of this project and the potential savings from lessons learnt, we hope that it will be money well spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100013#L00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1548936600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I cannot accept the responses to the questions I put.

In some cases, those individuals would have waited months or years for those appointments.  Next week, if the strike goes ahead, we will see another 25,000 cancellations.  The knock-on effect will be delays across the entire health system, just as are experiencing the worst weather we have had this year.  It will take months to recover those lost times, which will result in prolonged suffering and increased anxiety for thousands of people.  It is not as if we do not already have serious delays in the health system.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, in previous Governments I negotiated two public sector pay agreements.  I know all too well the constraints in terms of public spending and ensuring that agreements are adhered to by unions and workers, but by the same token, every single public sector agreement, certainly the ones that I was involved in, always had to deal with anomalies and inequalities that were presented at the time through side deals and special arrangements.  That has always been a feature of the agreements.  Specific issues have been raised by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, such as in relation to the acknowledged fact of the difficulty in retention and recruitment.  Nurses have expressed legitimate concerns.  As others have said, this is only the second strike by nurses in 100 years.<\/p><p>It is quite clear that this is not something they resort to lightly.  No nurse, as was evident on every picket line at every hospital yesterday, wants to be on strike.  Nursing is a vocation and our nurses are among the best in the world.  They want to be back at work but they need to know that their profession will be respected and secure in the future. <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach said in this House that all disputes end in a settlement.  He is right, but that only happens when both parties are fully engaged in an effort to find a solution that will address the real and genuine grievances set out while sustaining the public finances.  It is now incumbent on him and the Government to instruct public officials to engage with the INMO to work through these issues and find a mutually acceptable settlement.  The Government cannot stand on the sideline and expect a settlement to be arrived at without its direct intervention.  The Labour Court did not intervene yesterday because it judged the parties to be too far apart.  It is up to the T&aacute;naiste and the Government to reach out to nurses and find a solution.  Will he, therefore, assure patients who are worried about next week's appointments that the Government will make an intervention to resolve this dispute before the strike takes place?  That will clearly require flexibility and imagination; all settlements do.  Both of those are in short supply in the Government's approach to this issue to date. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100013#L02200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548937200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I agree with virtually everything the Deputy said apart from the final line.  The Government respects nurses.  The Government accepts and understands that no nurse wants to be out on strike when he or she could be at work.  There is an understanding that the INMO has not done this likely.  The union does not do it often.  This is a reflection of the frustration and anxiety in the nursing profession.  We want to work with nurses to address those concerns, but as the Deputy has said, we have to do it within the parameters of the pay agreement.  We must not unravel that agreement when there is still significant time for it to run and when as a Government we have committed hundreds of millions of euro to the delivery of our side of that agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants to look at how we can be flexible.  That is why we asked the Public Sector Pay Commission to look at this and to look at issues like qualification allowance, location allowance, dual qualification allowance increases and a series of other ways in which we can maintain consistency with the agreement while making a special arrangement within its confines, as the Deputy said.  If we move beyond that, other unions will immediately demand the same, as he knows.  My clear understanding is that the Government wants to be fair, open and imaginative regarding how we solve this problem, but we have to make sure we can afford any solution we sign up to.  We have to make sure it does not fundamentally undermine a pay agreement which is hugely important for the broader economy and for public sector workers across the country.  We also have to make sure that it does not involve shifting significant financial resources to salaries from other elements of healthcare.  Moreover, it must not require the Government to borrow to meet the pay commitments it signs up to, which would be madness.  Most people recognise that.  We want to reach out and talk and we want the Labour Court to be allowed to do its job.  We want to find a way of closing the gaps that will allow the court to make recommendations that we hope can be a basis for agreement.  However, we have to do that within the confines of an agreement that the Government and INMO has signed up to. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100014#M00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1548937200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Industrial relations are complex and challenging by their nature.

That is the nature of every single agreement because the public sector is a complex, multifaceted organisation.  That flexibility, imagination and creativity has not existed in the Government's approach to this issue to date.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which wants to protect the overarching public sector wage agreement - it is the ally of the Government in that regard - knows that there is the flexibility in the agreement to address the nurses' genuine grievance.

There were recurring themes on the dozens of picket lines visited by myself and my Socialist Party colleagues.  We heard of nurses that have no time to talk to patients, which is a fundamental of being a nurse; their feelings of guilt when their 13-hour shifts end; three midwives looking after 23 mothers and their babies on a ward; and trolley beds on wards, which is the overflow from emergency departments.  Hospital wards have frankly become dangerous due to ongoing deterioration in the nurse-to-patient ratio.  Are we to wait years before this Government recognises there is a crisis in nursing, just like we had to wait with the housing crisis?<\/p><p>Let us be clear.  This crisis applies only to the public health system.  There were no pickets at private hospitals yesterday because they do not have to adhere to pay agreements.  They pay inducements to recruit and retain their nurses.  This is about patients and the public health system but it is also about pay.  They may have been portrayed as angels over the years, but nurses do not have gossamer wings when the landlord comes looking for the rent.  We hear of nurses getting up at 4.30 a.m. because they cannot afford to live in Dublin; nurses for whom mortgages are a thing of the past; and nurses who have been eating beans for the last week up to payday.  As one nurse in Connolly hospital said, this is about long-standing abuse of women workers.  We hear about the gender pay gap.  This is the gender pay gap in action, perpetrated by our own Government. <\/p><p>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that a society that cannot afford to pay nurses is a sad society we should not tolerate?  I note the editorial in <i>The Times <\/i>Ireland edition urging the Government not to pay nurses.  That is how billionaires like Mr. Rupert Murdoch and the establishment feel.  They think we do not need a society, just like Margaret Thatcher said.  What we saw yesterday was the most powerful display of worker solidarity.  Fire-fighters, prison officers and patients visited picket lines. <\/p><p>There was a conveyor belt of pizzas, cakes, donuts and coffee of all kinds because there is an innate solidarity among workers.  The T&aacute;naiste's attempt, and the attempt of others, to divide and conquer workers by pitting them against each other will fail.  I note the mealy-mouthed words of the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I have not heard Labour say &ldquo;pay the nurses&rdquo; like a labour party is meant to do because it is reticent about that.

First, I would not be playing tough man talking about penalties on nurses because that would stir up massive support from the public, but the Government is in a dilemma because that penalty and threat fails against workers if it is not applied to nurses.  That is the reality.  I call on the trade union leadership not to allow this strike to linger on but to harness the overwhelming support we saw yesterday between workers and launch a united trade union campaign to give nurses, midwives and psychiatric nurses a reason to stay or to return.  Also, equal pay across the public sector should be restored.  We cannot recruit teachers either.  All workers, public and private, need a pay rise.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's alternative to paying the nurses?  Do not just pat them on the back and tell them how great they are; they need pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100015#N00800","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1548937800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I will tell the Deputy what it is not.

One of those commitments was the building of a 50 bed unit in St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon, another was the building of a 50 bed unit in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon and the final commitment was the building of a 50 bed unit at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, which is desperately needed because of the issues with the accident and emergency department.  Will the T&aacute;naiste assure me today that none of those three projects will be put on the back foot or pushed down the line because of the overspend in the new children's hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100016#O02200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1548938400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The capital plan is being reviewed and finalised by the HSE, which was mentioned earlier in this House.

I am introducing this Bill because we are increasingly concerned at use of unregulated and unaccountable security firms by banks and other organisations to enforce court orders.  It is extremely serious and we believe it requires legislative action.<\/p><p>We first raised this matter with the Minister in September, following the controversial Frederick Street protests and evictions in which private security firms were seen to be quite heavy handed, causing significant controversy.  At the time, I contacted the Private Security Authority to complain about the conduct of those involved in that eviction and in the enforcement of a court order.  It informed me that it had no responsibility for that.  I was told that those who were undertaking repossessions are not covered by the Private Security Services Act.  <\/p><p>It is a fact that a clear loophole exists in the Private Security Services Act 2004 and, obviously, that is of major concern.  I raised this with the Minister at that time and I called on him to act or advised that we would bring forward legislation.  To date, we have not seen any legislation or the heads of a Bill.Therefore, I am introducing this Bill.<\/p><p>The accounts provided from the recent eviction in Roscommon were appalling, with private security personnel being given apparent free reign to do as they wished to the people being evicted.  It brought to mind scenes from our past of people being thrown out on to the side of the road.  It is also a cause of concern that the Garda did not intervene to prevent this and, according to reports, it closed off the road to facilitate these actions by these bank enforcers.  Clearly, there is a major anomaly and oversight in that people who are involved in the enforcement of court orders and evictions, and all that involves, are potentially unregulated.<\/p><p>Our Bill would amend section 2 of the Private Security Services Act 2004 by adding a new category of security personnel to come within the remit of the Act, and under the scope of the Private Security Authority.  It reads: &quot;persons involved in the execution and\/or enforcement of Court orders including Orders for Repossession&quot;.<\/p><p>This Act generally involves the regulation and oversight of security staff.  For example, sections 29 and 30 of the Act are explicit in stating that all operating with the sector must identify themselves clearly, and show ID to anyone who requests it.  The authority also covers areas such as the ability to grant and renew licences; issue identity cards to licensees; where appropriate; suspend or revoke licences; establish and maintain a register of licensees; specify standards to be observed in the provision of security services by licensees or particular categories of licensees; specify qualifications or any other requirements, including requirements as to training for the granting of licences; undertake or commission the compilation of statistical information and other records necessary for the proper planning, development and provision of those services; investigate any security services being provided by any person; establish and administer a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints against licensees; monitor the provision of private security services generally; liaise with licensees; and advise the Minister on any matter relating to its functions.<\/p><p>None of this currently applies to this area.  There is no licensing, ability to revoke a licence, requirement for identification or any route for complaints.  That situation is unacceptable.  We expect door staff in our bars and people who are doing security in shops in our high street to be subject to regulation and high standards, yet people involved in the most intrusive, hard edged and indeed potentially violent security work are not subject to any regulation.  It is incredible and unacceptable and this Bill seeks to resolve that.  The lack of accountability is shocking and those who are forcing evictions and acting in a violent or abusive way must be held accountable, must be subject to regulation and must be capable of having a complaint made against them.  Our Bill would rectify that.  It would ensure that anyone involved in an eviction would be subject to standards, oversight, licensing and would carry identification.  They could also be the subject of complaints.  That is the bare minimum we can expect.  The Bill will provide for that and I hope the Government will support it.<\/p> <p> I am aware that there were recently threats against Government Ministers relating to evictions.  I condemn that.

Promoting positive mental health and well-being is important to us all, particularly as mental health can be a complex and emotive issue.  This applies particularly to vulnerable young people who must face evolving pressures and expectations while having limited experience or perspective.  Having spent years working directly with young people, I am very aware that they face entirely new challenges that are beyond the experience of older generations.  Alongside these are new opportunities to connect and communicate with each other and with services and it is incumbent on us as policymakers to make the most of them.  It is encouraging that during my time as Minister of State I have found wide agreement in both Houses of the Oireachtas and among external stakeholders to develop our mental health legislation, policies and services.  The Government has consistently prioritised investment in mental health and the HSE has been implementing new or expanded improvements year-on-year.  I remain as open as ever to suggestion or constructive criticism that will result in a better CAMHS service.  These are often allied to linked improvements around primary care, disability care or early intervention and prevention measures.  We must also include enhancements beyond the health system such as those relating to education, justice, childcare or online safety.  The best interests and mental well-being of young people must be our first concern in every policy area that deals with them.<\/p><p>The ongoing reform agenda in mental health services has led to much needed change on many fronts, destigmatising mental illness and encouraging open discussion and a recovery focus.  Delivering modern mental health services requires adequate resourcing.  Beyond that it requires a new outlook to maximise the impact of existing structures and provision.  This ranges from addressing acknowledged staff recruitment and retention difficulties to further rebalancing primary care and specialist interventions such as CAMHS.  The implementation difficulties we face do not relate to a lack of funding for the key HSE mental health care programme <i>per se<\/i>.  While the fundamentals of our policies and services remain on course, informed by past experience and future needs, there is real scope to do at least some things differently, rather than endlessly expecting more funding to solve problems that can be otherwise addressed.  Securing a supply of trained and skilled staff, particularly at consultant level, is a multi-year project and with other countries also experiencing shortages, it is clear an innovative approach is required.<\/p><p>Even in the face of these challenges, developing mental health services remains a priority for the Government and, in line with programme for Government commitments, further investment will continue as overall resources and service pressures allow.  Budget 2019 provided an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health, which brings overall HSE mental health funding to nearly &euro;1 billion this year.  Our aim has been that services become more person-centred, user-friendly, responsive to need and recovery orientated.  We have had to respond too, given that demand for CAMHS has increased by over 20% for referrals since 2012.  Increasing demands and complexity of cases continue to emerge.  A single specialist service such as CAMHS cannot be expected to address all issues.<\/p><p>CAMHS is a specialist clinical service for those under 18 with mental health difficulties that affect their thoughts, feelings and behaviours every day.  It is not for everyone nor is it designed to be.  Only a small percentage of the population requires access to this service.  Some conditions treated in CAMHS include moderate to severe depression, anxiety, eating disorders and self-harm.  It has never been a goal to increase referrals to CAMHS.  Reducing the number of young people who need this intervention is key, not simply from a resource perspective, but for the sake of the well-being of children and young people.  There are now 70 CAMHS teams in place across Ireland.  The vast majority of interventions in CAMHS occur in a community setting and this is in keeping with both A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare principles and recommendations.  Young people with moderate to severe mental health difficulties are referred to specialist mental health services by primary care practitioners such as GPs or psychologists.  Specialist mental health services are provided by multidisciplinary teams.  These services are concentrated in community teams where only those with needs above that threshold are referred to specialist inpatient settings.  Over 90% of mental health needs can be successfully treated within a primary care setting, with a need for fewer than 10% to be referred to specialist community-based mental health services.  Of this number, approximately 1% have needs that require inpatient care and nine out of every ten of these admissions are voluntary.<\/p><p>The HSE is committed to ensuring all aspects of CAMHS services are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved access and reducing waiting lists.  In 2015, the HSE introduced a new standard operating procedure for CAMHS.  This has helped improve the service overall, including by reducing inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units.  It has also been a learning experience, prompting services to feed back on how procedures can be improved.  On foot of this, a revised standard operating procedure, SOP, is being rolled out.  Demographic pressures mean it will always be challenging to maintain the trend of improving access but the HSE is committed to ensuring the admission of children to appropriate units as much as possible and this situation has improved considerably over recent years.  The total number of children on CAMHS waiting lists was approximately 2,560 at the end of November 2018.  The HSE has prioritised reducing CAMHS waiting lists and particularly the number waiting over 12 months, which was 295 in November.  In conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE, I continually monitor the data nationally to see where further improvements can be made.  I have recently spoken to the managers of all the community healthcare organisation, CHOs, and I stressed that I would not be introducing waiting list initiatives because I prioritise real long-lasting reform over short-term solutions.  Around 18,000 CAMHS referrals are expected in 2019.  Cases assessed by professionals as being urgent are seen as a matter of priority.  It is important to point out the figure is an increase from around 12,800 referrals received in 2011.  This is a significant additional case load that health professionals are dealing with and is something that is too often overlooked by those who criticise the services.  Occasionally, we should all take a step back and look at the very good work being done by the HSE instead of constantly highlighting negative situations because it will not encourage any person to step forward for help at early intervention stage.<\/p><p>There are 76 CAMHS inpatient beds in four acute units nationally with plans for additional beds in the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the new national forensic mental health complex now being built at Portrane.  This is due to open in 2020.  I will undertake an on-site visit there on 5 February 2019 and this major capital project is progressing well.  The key relevance to the debate today is the fact that a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit, the first of its kind in the country, will be provided at Portrane.  This should reduce to a great degree the need to send our more complex cases abroad for treatment.  As stated, older adolescents can at times be admitted to adult units.  This takes place only after efforts to place them in CAMHS units are unsuccessful due to capacity or clinical needs.  All admissions of young people under the age of 18 years are notified to the Mental Health Commission in accordance with regulations.  All such admissions are also notified to the HSE national mental health service by the regions.  It should also be noted that clinicians are not in favour of cut-off points such as a person's 18th birthday.  Where inpatient treatment is nearing completion but might need to be continued beyond a person's 18th birthday, consideration may be given by the CAMHS inpatient team to complete the intervention as an inpatient within the CAMHS unit.  In such cases, best interest principles must apply.  Such principles must take into account the needs of the individual young person who has just turned 18 as well as the other children or young people who are on the unit.  HSE national mental health services work closely with local and national CAMHS inpatient services to ensure the clinical needs of the young person are assessed and addressed within the most appropriate setting for the young person and their family.  <\/p><p>On 23 January, I convened a meeting with all nine HSE CHOs specifically to review CAMHS.  By bringing specialists and managers from across the country together, I am pushing knowledge transfer and co-operative working.  The success of day hospital facilities and of nurse-prescribing in respect of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, in some regions was of interest to me.<\/p><p>I will be working with the HSE in order to identify how these initiatives can be expanded.<br\/><br\/>Another initiative aimed at improving early intervention for young people with emerging and mild mental health difficulties is the enhancement of primary care psychology services through the employment of assistant psychologists.  The recruitment of 114 new assistant psychologists is now complete and over 2018 they have become actively involved in primary care teams providing psychological interventions for young people.  This major development aims to ensure that young people whose clinical needs are at primary care level receive appropriate intervention, and do not end up on secondary care waiting lists due to lack of appropriate assessment and resources in primary care.  Another measure I have brought forward is the training and appointment of ten new advanced nurse practitioners specifically for CAMHS.  When these have completed training later this year, they will be directed to areas of greatest service pressures, including reducing waiting lists.<br\/><br\/>A priority for me is to introduce a new approach to prevention and early intervention in youth mental health care.  One obvious and tangible spin-off is not only to provide the level of care appropriate in individual cases, but also to help reduce pressures on the specialist CAMHS service.  This initiative has been included in this year&rsquo;s HSE service plan.<br\/><br\/>In the context of developing CAMHS, and other initiatives relating to prevention and early intervention, the HSE service plan for 2019 will: continue to implement the recommendations of the youth mental health task force; implement the agreed development of a 24-7 contact line, crisis text line and other e-mental health digital responses; work with sports, community and voluntary groups to develop resilience and reduce demand for mental health services; develop a seven-day-per-week service for CAMHS to ensure supports for vulnerable young persons in line with Connecting for Life; progress day-programme and day-hospital services within CAMHS; develop eating disorder specialist community teams in both adult and CAMHS services; enhance Jigsaw and other early intervention services specific to those aged 18 to 25; enhance access by older adolescents to specialist mental health services and, for those requiring acute admission, their continued appropriate placement and care in child and adolescent-specific settings; and implement the recently developed CAMHS advocacy model.The new funding coming through this year will obviously also be used to enhance existing CAMHS teams, whether acute or community-based.<br\/><br\/>In the context of pursuing new avenues overall, which will also directly or indirectly benefit CAMHS, we now know from a clear evidence base that many young people wish to avail of information and support on mental health through online channels.  While this is not the silver bullet to all problems, the experience of this where is works well in other countries shows significant potential to effectively address many issues here, including benefits for CAMHS.<br\/><br\/>I have made digital mental health service improvement a key priority.  The HSE has embraced this project because the benefits for services are so clear.  The digital mental health service encompasses developing online content, signposting of supports and services, and an active listening service based on the provision of text support.

Perhaps the Minister of State's speech could be made available to Members.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue of CAMHS.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for arranging this debate and for his continued work in highlighting mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  Demand for acute CAMHS is increasing.  More than 2,500 children are now waiting for a first appointment.  Almost 300 of them have been waiting more than a year for first assessments.  This is an intolerable wait for children to see specialists.  It is a scandal that children and young people are waiting so long for treatment.  The failure to give people with mental illnesses the timely help they need is irreparably damaging their lives.  Long waits for access to necessary mental health supports can be deeply distressing for people.  From childhood to later life, it is vital that mental health support is available for children and young people and their families.  I want to put these waiting times into context.  In the UK, there is a new guaranteed maximum four-week waiting time for children with more complex problems to access National Health Service, NHS, CAMHS.  Recently, there was outrage in Scotland that delays for access to CAMHS had extended to 18 weeks.  In Ireland, the wait can be over 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  Why are our CAMHS in such short supply?  There are a number of reasons, but they are ultimately caused by the Government's failure to prioritise children&rsquo;s mental health.  There are a significant number of child psychiatrist vacancies.  For example, a child psychiatrist travels to Wexford from Galway every weekend to provide cover because for the past six months there has been no child psychiatrist in Wexford, which has a population of 150,000.  The conditions within which the CAMHS staff work in are horrific.  They are so bad, they in part led to the last child psychiatrist in Wexford leaving.  There have been endless false promises about a new facility.  The situation is regrettably similar in many other parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  There are shocking waiting times for primary care psychology.  Again, taking my county of Wexford as an example, the wait is three years and no urgent cases are being seen.  This means that an opportunity is lost with mental health issues where there could have been an intervention at an early stage and a resolution found.  Instead the issue goes untreated and may progress to a more serious issue, necessitating CAMHS intervention which ultimately puts more pressure on CAMHS.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has failed to roll out Jigsaw nationwide.  It is an absolute scandal that non-qualified specialists are working as consultant psychiatrists.  Children are still being admitted to adult wards in breach of their human rights because there are not sufficient beds in the system.  Many of the beds that are there are not operational throughout the year.  Children with autism cannot get the mental health care they need.  Only 12 whole-time equivalent staff in the whole country work in the mental health disability sector.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the confidence and supply agreement, an extra &euro;55 million was made available for mental health services and new initiatives in the budget.  However, the Government spent almost that amount on agency staff last year.<\/p>  <p>  Whenever the Department was challenged about long waiting lists last year, we were told not to be complaining because there were going to be an additional 4,000 referrals to CAMHS, an increase of 40%.  Anyone with the most basic knowledge of CAMHS knew this was a farcical promise.  The latter proved to be the case, with only a little over 10,000 people seen - an almost identical number to the year before.  Thankfully, that promise is not being repeated this year.<\/p>  <p>  Psychiatric nurses are escalating their industrial action and they have our strong support.  They are voting with their feet.  The number of vacancies in psychiatric nursing has increased by 40% since 2017.  Psychiatric nurses are overworked and highly stressed and the facilities in which they operate are understaffed.  Their own mental health is under strain.  The Minister needs to engage with them.<\/p>  <p>  Children and young people's mental health is clearly not a priority.  What do we know about young people and their mental health?  We know that approximately half of all mental illness starts before the age of 14 and therefore it is critical that children get the mental health supports they need as soon as they need it.  We know that if we catch mental illness early we can treat it and prevent it turning into something more serious.  We know there is a crisis in young people&rsquo;s mental health.  There is a crisis with those young people accessing mental health care.  Many vulnerable children under the age of 18, including some who may be suicidal, are being forced to wait unfairly for the care they need and deserve, or are being denied care because CAMHS are overloaded.  Our children are being let down.<\/p>  <p>  We also know that with timely and appropriate intervention our children can recover.  What are the consequences of the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide appropriate and timely mental health care for our children?  The first obvious point is that they get worse.  Like any physical illness left untreated, a mental illness worsens without intervention.  This means that when intervention is provided, if it is provided, the condition has become more ingrained, the treatment required is more severe and the recovery period is significantly longer.<\/p>  <p>  While all this has been happening, very often a child&rsquo;s well-being will have spiralled downwards.  His or her ability to participate in society will have been impacted.  He or she may find school difficult and may drop out or face expulsion.  He or she may become susceptible to criminal gangs that seek to take advantage of his or her vulnerability.  He or she may end up in prison or, worse, take his or her own life.  Fundamentally, children are being denied their basic human rights to health care so that they can recover and live healthy empowered lives.<\/p>  <p>  None of this is necessary.  The Government needs to take urgent action to address the crisis in CAMHS.  There are solutions and our children can recover, but this will only happen if their recovery is prioritised.  Unfortunately, there is little sign of this happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100022#Y00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1548942000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time.  I will focus on a major issue with children's mental health and disability teams in Galway.  While the figures seem to indicate that CHO2 is brilliant, those figures are distorted.  They relate to the intellectual services and the disability services within those.  Last April, a meeting was held in Merlin Park to deal with children who were primarily diagnosed with autism, but who are down under the section to do with CAMHS.  Some 200 parents attended along with the Galway Autism Partnership, GAP.  Every parent in that room was promised that they would be receiving a letter because they were transitioning them away from CAMHS, just as the Minister of State said in his introduction and they were putting them on the right pathway for the intervention.<\/p>  <p>  That does not mean to say that all the children might not have needed some formal level of intervention with CAMHS, but a pathway was being put in place.  Regrettably the assessments have only started in the past couple of weeks.  Not all of those parents have received a letter to date which is very unfortunate because some people in that room had been waiting for a letter for more than two years.  These are parents with children in fourth, fifth or sixth class.  They were concerned about them going into first year and what provisions would be put in place for them in the secondary school.  However, nearly 12 months later, that letter has not been released, which is very unfortunate.<\/p><p>I see that there is nothing on a six, nine or 12 month waiting list but I know that is not the case and does not reflect the situation on the ground.  Before I came in here to speak on this issue, I rang the Galway Autism Partnership group and was told that the assessments are just starting but that they have been outsourced.  Parents are not confident at the moment because they are not getting the letters.  The group also bemoaned the fact that children with intellectual disabilities are at a disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>children with physical disabilities and that is not right.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister of State knows, early intervention is key here but that is not what is happening.  Children are waiting far too long for the necessary intervention.  Intervention should not wait until the critical stage and should be provided through CAMHS.  It should be provided earlier through the primary care sector.  We must provide more support for primary care services.  The Minister of State made reference to e-care and we must do far more to bring primary care practitioners on board.  Many primary care units are not capable of providing the intervention that is required.  The Minister of State spoke at a meeting of the mental health committee about virtual consultations at primary care centres.  That would be a great way to provide relief to families and children but it must be rolled out across the country.  It has not reached the west as far as I know, but if it has, I ask the Minister of State to tell me what level it is at because I would positively promote it.  Schools should also be told about that service if it is available, but to my knowledge it is not.  At this moment in time, as far as parents and the wider community are aware, the only way to get an assessment and support is through CAMHS.  We know that the service is short staffed and that there are enormous problems at all levels in terms of providing support.<br\/><br\/>There is a severe lack of mental health beds for children in Galway.  Young children are ending up on adult wards which is totally unacceptable.  Dr. Niall Muldoon appeared before the mental health committee and spoke passionately about children's experience of being on adult psychiatric wards.  It is shocking to think that we would do that to children.  Obviously, they had some problems on admission but they came out with even more problems.  Facilities in the new children's hospital are expected to be brilliant but in the meantime we must ring-fence more mental health beds for children around the country.  The CAMHS inpatient beds in Galway are for children in 11 counties.  We must ring fence more beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100022#Y00300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548942600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue today.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for scheduling this discussion and the Minister of State for his input.  It is 2019 and I had hoped to be coming in here in a more optimistic frame of mind but I am still disappointed.  In his opening remarks the Minister of State referred to investment, recruitment, a lack of funding and so on.  I would like to provide a synopsis of the current situation.  We still have growing waiting lists for initial and follow-up assessments and we still have a shortage of staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists.  We have no transitional services for older teens and young adults and no 24-7 community mental health services.  The Minister of State made reference earlier to 76 beds but as of last week, according to a reply to a parliamentary question, we only have 72 beds, of which only 39 are operational.  We have gone backwards with regard to beds.  In November, 49 out of 74 beds were open which means that we have lost two beds and closed ten since then.<\/p>  <p>  There is a huge difficulty with the implementation of the operating procedures within CAMHS, according to the Jigsaw report commissioned by the Minister of State.  The report was very frank and honest but the level of engagement by the service providers with the authors was very disappointing.  Perhaps they were over stressed and did not have the time to complete the survey.<\/p>  <p>  An earlier speaker referred to services for children with intellectual disabilities which are actually non-existent.  This is so frustrating for everyone.  A number of weeks ago, a family was forced to make a young child a ward of court so that the child could be sent to England for help.  That is the reality of what is happening in this country.  Waiting lists were also referred to earlier.  In my own area, there are almost 2,500 waiting for a CAMHS appointment, more than 300 of whom have been waiting for more than 12 months.  A full 26% of the total on waiting lists nationally are in CHO 4, covering Cork and Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to be negative here.  The people who work in the system deserve our respect because they are doing their best.  It is understandable that members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association are engaged in industrial action today.  Their main concern is not pay but patient safety and a lack of resources.  There were 82 young people admitted to adult wards in 2017.  In January 2018, there were 623 staff in CAMHS but by January 2019, that figure had dropped by 4% down to 597.  Again, we are going backwards.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about funding.  While I would not go so far as to describe what he said as disingenuous, it was certainly misleading.  He referred to 2018 and an additional &euro;84 million.  I have a copy of a presentation given by the HSE in the AV room a number of weeks ago, which the Minister of State attended.  In 2018, the figure was &euro;35 million; in 2017, it was &euro;15 million; in 2016, it was &euro;35 million; and in 2014, it was &euro;25 million.  The Government is putting information into the public domain suggesting that it has spent additional money and that things are going to get better but that is misleading.  The facts speak for themselves in that we are going backwards.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that the Oireachtas mental health committee is reconvened.  We need a vehicle that has the power to hold the HSE and everyone else in the system to account.  This is vital if we are to make progress.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke previously about the revolving door and said that no child should be turned away.  However, there are still major issues with regard to those with a dual diagnosis.  Children and young adults are presenting with a combination of problems and are being sent from pillar to post because nobody wants to take responsibility for them.  There is no accountability or responsibility in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  This is not a personal attack on the Minister of State.  I would like to sit down with his advisers to determine where they are getting their information because it is not the same information that we are getting through parliamentary questions and through feedback from the general public.<\/p>  <p>  I have run out of time and will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Mitchell.  I look forward to talking to the Minister of State again about the future of mental health care in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100023#Z00200","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1548942600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very serious issue.  Unfortunately, mental health services in this State are in a very bad way.  We have problems with waiting lists, staffing levels and resources, to name but a few.  This is having a very direct and noticeable impact on the people who need these <\/p>  <p>services.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to tell the Minister of State and the House about a woman with whom I am dealing.  Her young son was referred to the CAMHS team in my area.  He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and oppositional defiant disorder, ODD and threatened to take his own life.  One can only imagine how his mother was feeling and what she went through.  She was incredibly upset by the whole situation and was extremely worried about her son but was told that she would be waiting for up to a year for her son to be seen by the CAMHS team.  That is not good enough.  <\/p>  <p>  We have heard from staff who work in this area who speak of being unable to meet the level of demand.  Under-staffing and the inability to recruit staff is placing enormous pressure on our mental health services.  In my own area, the CAMHS staffing level last year was two thirds of what was recommended in A Vision for Change.  We must ask why the staffing levels are so low.  <\/p><p>A Vision for Change was published in 2006.  Why, 13 years on, are we still facing these issues?  The reality is that in comparison with 13 years ago, many more young people are presenting to CAMHS and presentations are generally much more complex.  Yet, in 2018, the number of mental health services staff decreased by 4% between the start of the year and November.  This is a recurring theme in agencies dealing with our young people.  Tusla is another example of where teams are operating with low staffing levels and cannot meet the demands placed on them.  What does the Government propose to do to recruit and retain staff?  I am concerned, as I am sure is every other Member, that we will end up in the vicious circle of a lack of staff resulting in stress and increased workloads on existing staff and, in turn, an inability to retain staff.  We need to break this cycle.  The Government needs to examine what initiatives it can take to help.<\/p> <p> Mental health services funding and resources, unfortunately, have always been an after-thought.  This cannot continue.  The Minister and the Government have an obligation to our young people.  They need to ensure that adequate funding and resources are available to mental health services and that children, wherever they are in this State, can access treatment and services in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100023#Z00300","speaker":"1362","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548943200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  Mental health issues are the leading cause of disability among young people aged between ten and 24 around the world.  According to research carried out by the Royal College of Surgeons for the Health Research Board in 2013, by the age of 13, one in three young people in Ireland is likely to have experienced some type of mental disorder; by the age of 24, this rate will have increased to more than one in two; more than one in 15 young people had engaged in deliberate self-harm; and, by the age of 24, one in five young people will have experienced suicidal ideation.  Census 2016 showed that the percentage of people with a psychological or emotional condition increased by almost 30% between 2011 and 2016.  This included a 140% increase in mental health conditions among 13 to 19 year old women and an 89% increase among adolescent men of the same age.<\/p><p>According to some reports, shockingly, 15% of 11 to 13 year olds have experienced significant psychological illness.  As of May 2018, more than 6,500 children and young people were waiting for their first psychological appointment.  Ireland is one of a small minority of OECD countries where young people are more likely to take their lives than older age groups.  To address this, there is an urgent need to provide 24-7 access to mental healthcare for young people, including free access to counselling in schools and colleges, and to integrate mental health into the school curriculum.  Crucially, there must be a major increase in funding for mental health services and a major expansion of youth mental health services.<\/p><p>I would like to focus on one of the key underlying causes of these issues.  I believe that economic inequality, exploitation and the multiple forms of oppression that exist in capitalist societies are a major factor.  According to the late social writer, Mark Fisher:<\/p><blockquote>Capitalist realism insists on treating mental health as if it were a natural fact, like weather ... we need to ask: how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are ill?  The &quot;mental health plague&quot; in capitalist societies would suggest that, instead of being the only social system that works, capitalism is inherently dysfunctional, and that the cost of it appearing to work is very high.<br \/><br \/>It is not an exaggeration to say that being a teenager...is now close to being reclassified as a sickness.  This pathologization already forecloses any possibility of politicization.  By privatizing these problems - treating them as if they were caused only by chemical imbalances in the individual's neurology and-or by their family background - any question of social systemic causation is ruled out.<\/blockquote><p>The psychologist, Oliver James, also links the increase in mental illness to neoliberal capitalism with its emphasis on individual competitiveness.<\/p><p>The PNA commenced its industrial action today.  This is relevant to this debate because, as with the magnificent strike of INMO members yesterday, higher pay for psychiatric nurses is crucial to solving the crisis of recruitment and retention in mental health services.  On top of staff cuts, and an ever-growing mental health crisis, low pay is one of the main causes of the chronic understaffing of mental health services and the endless waiting lists.  Low pay for mental health workers stems from the wider problem of cuts and ongoing underfunding of mental health services.  The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care found that pay is a significant factor hindering recruitment and retention and, therefore, the problems in the mental health services are at root a problem of insufficient funding.  According to the PNA, as of last summer, there were 500 vacancies for psychiatric nurses in the health service but the total number of additional nurses needed to implement the Government's long-term strategy, A Vision for Change, is closer to 2,000.  The number of mental health beds was cut from 12,484 in 1984 to 1,002 in 2016.  We need a major reversal of the cuts and increased funding in mental health services and, crucially, a major increase in funding for youth mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100024#AA00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1548943200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I would like to focus first on the now redundant Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, of which my colleague, Deputy Gino Kenny, was a member.  The committee identified that the problem in CAMHS stems from the lack of early intervention, early diagnosis and early assessment.  All of us have dealt with cases involving parents who are concerned for their children at an early age and cannot access assessments for them.  In one such case, the parents are engaging with the legal system on behalf of their child who is almost two years waiting for an assessment.  The future for this young boy if he does not access early intervention will be a lifetime in CAMHS.  He will probably end up on medication.  Owing to the lack of psychologists, speech therapists and nurses, bed occupancy in CAMHS at any given time is 50%.  I know this because Linn Dara, one of the units providing a national service, is in my area and we regularly picket it since 11 of its 22 beds are regularly closed.  Young children who do not get early assessments and intervention from psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, etc., end up in CAMHS or being medicated.  Service users are being failed by a lack of psychologists.  Psychologists are walking away from the job in frustration because all that is available to these children is medication rather than the therapies they deserve.  We will then treat them as adults with serious mental health difficulties in a system which has utterly failed them.<\/p><p>It is 13 years since a Vision for Change was launched.  I think last week was the anniversary of its launch.  It is not just this Government but successive Governments, successive Ministers and the Department of Health have failed to implement that vision.  Of 108 beds, 50 are usually occupied while the rest of them lie empty.  As Deputy Barry said, psychiatric nurses are starting an overtime ban today and will be joining the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in strike action in another week and a half.  That is not something they do for pleasure, for joy or for the craic or because they are selfish professionals.  It is because there is a crisis in our mental health services which the Minister of State - this is not a personal - and those who preceded him have utterly failed in terms of young people.  Legal cases will be taken and will force the HSE to deal with this problem.<\/p> <p> The new head of the HSE said that the primacy of early intervention is where the problem with CAMHS starts.  Ms Anne O'Connor was head of mental health and she now saying that CAMHS is a secondary service but it is the early service that is lacking.  I speak for tens of thousands of parents who are distressed, concerned and worried about their children who are not getting the services that they need.  We are going to end up with mental health services that are in a continuous crisis situation where if one system fails, the following systems fail and there is no future for people who are in desperate situations.<\/p> <p> I do not know the Minister of State is going to address this but I would argue that multiple issues need to be addressed.  One of them, crucially, is staffing and the psychiatric nurses are doing something about that and are putting it up to the Minister of State and the Government to pay them properly so that they can retain their numbers and continue to recruit the numbers needed.<\/p> <p> I am sure child psychiatrists would love to do something similar and put it up to the Government because they are exiting the service and are voting with their feet by pulling out of the service.  It is in crisis.  The mental health committee should give the numbers needed to get out of this crisis.  That committee should reconvene.  The necessary steps must be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100024#AA00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548943800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>It is nearly a year since Dr. Kieran Moore resigned from his position as consultant child psychiatrist in CAMHS in Wexford and there is still no replacement.  He specifically cited the working conditions in the CAMHS facility at Slaney House, Wexford, as reason for his resignation.  We understood in September that the new CAMHS facility at Arden House would be open in a matter of weeks.  In response to a parliamentary question I submitted in November, after no sign of the facility opening, I was told that the new facility at Arden House would be opening in the first quarter of 2019.  We now hear that the work required for the new facility at Arden House has only recently gone to tender and that the facility will not be open now until July.  I am unsure how we expect to attract consultant child psychiatrist to replace Dr. Moore if we have not improved the working conditions that he cited as the reason for his own resignation.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately half the positions on CAMHS teams nationally have been vacant for a number of years.  The staffing levels in CAMHS Wexford, north and south, in 2017 were 48% and 42%, respectively, of the recommended staffing levels in A Vision for Change.  Consistently throughout 2018, almost 3,000 children and adolescents were waiting for a CAMHS appointment.  The children and young people on that waiting list are waiting for a first appointment, which is their initial assessment, and not for actual treatment.  They will then have to endure a protracted waiting period.<\/p>  <p>  The problems with CAMHS need to be seen in context.  The pressure on CAMHS is compounded as a direct result of the lack of adequate alternatives.  CAMHS has become, as the national director of mental health services in the HSE said, a catchall service.  This is a crucial point.  CAMHS is a specialist service for the most severe mental health cases but is being swamped by inappropriate referrals because the options in terms of referrals from GPs for children and adolescents who present with mental health problems are so limited and narrow in scope.  The waiting list for primary care child psychology services in Wexford are over three years long at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The over-medicalisation of mental health services is also a massive problem.  Public psychotherapy and counselling services for children and adolescents are limited.  Places like the Ferns Youth Diocesan Centre in Wexford are doing very good work but there are not enough of these counselling hours available.  There are private practices but not everybody can afford them.<\/p>  <p>  A Vision for Change states that the consensus among users and service providers was that psychological therapies should be regarded as a fundamental component of basic mental health services rather than being viewed as additional options that are not consistent consistently available.  This is one of the main messages of A Vision for Change consultations, that people want alternatives to medical medication, including access to counselling and psychotherapy.  A Vision for Change states that all individuals should have access to a comprehensive range of interventions in primary care for disorders that do not require special specialist mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  There is, as far as I can see, a very broad consensus among almost all mental health service stakeholders that the lack of accessible counselling services is a massive problem and that it is at the heart of much that is wrong with our mental health services.  This is one of the strongest messages expressed in the interim and final reports of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  A related issue also highlighted in the committee's reports was that there was an over-reliance on medication as a response to preventing mental health ill-health issues in the absence of alternatives in primary and community care levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish College of General Practitioners and the Mental Health Reform Coalition have repeatedly referred to what they see as an over-dependence on medication in our mental health services.  The Ombudsman for Children told the Oireachtas committee that children themselves have identified a rush to medicate them in their treatment.  I find this an incredible statement.  If so many people who work in the mental health services are crying out for talk therapy supports, if this need is so clearly laid out in A Vision for Change and if the national director of mental health services is making similar noises when speaking of the pressure on CAMHS, then why has so little progress been made to make these changes?  Perhaps the Minister of State might address this point.  It does not seem to be an ideological based position based on the evidence of the of the various groups I just mentioned.  Will the regulation of psychotherapy help?  Maybe it will.  I know many psychotherapists are concerned about how their skills have been ignored so much to date.  They are very wary of the proposed tele-counselling model.  Tele-psychiatry may be a work around because of the global shortage of consultant psychiatrist but tele-counselling, according to many counsellors, fundamentally misunderstands the nature of counselling and psychotherapy.<\/p>  <p>  While people are crying out for talk therapies, psychotherapists and counsellors are being routinely exploited by the Government's policy of indirectly funding psychotherapists and counsellors via the voluntary and charitable sector.  These charities, often funded by Tusla, for example, routinely advertise and recruit qualified accredited and pre-accredited psychotherapists on a voluntary basis and expect them to work for nothing.  I can give many examples of this and a number of psychotherapists and counsellors raised this issue with me recently.  We have created culture in which psychotherapists are sometimes expected to work for nothing.  This is a misdirection of public funds and it only serves to lower the standard of available counselling.<\/p>  <p>  There are at least 5,700 accredited psychotherapists registered with the two main accrediting bodies in Ireland.  They will have at least a level 8 honours degree in psychotherapy and counselling.  They are experienced, skilled and eager to work but do not fit the HSE's qualification requirements for the grade of counsellor.  We have a farcical situation where if someone presents with suicidal ideation, he or she is routinely referred by the HSE to the services of Pieta House, for example.  I spoke to psychotherapist this week who works with Pieta House.  She regularly counsels such clients who are referred from the HSE, yet she herself does not fit the criteria to work in the HSE itself.  Even more bizarre, she is a supervisor of psychotherapy and counselling and supervises therapists who work for the HSE.  We need to re-examine the qualification criteria for the grade of counsellor within the HSE to remedy this farcical situation.  If we can create the grade of assistant psychologist, we can certainly look again at the counsellor or therapist grade.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister of State to increase investment in talk therapies.  The mental health services spend roughly &euro;400 million per year on drugs while some &euro;10 million is spent on counselling.  The Minister of State may correct those figures but if they are even close to correct, I am sure he would agree this kind of spending is disproportionate and needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> I am not blaming the Minister of State for all the problems we face in this area and I believe he is genuinely interested in making things better.  I listened to his speech, in particular where he said we are perhaps too eager to give out about the HSE and what it is and is not doing.  He will have to forgive us, given there are so many problems.  Surely he would agree we need to move faster to get to a place where we use more psychotherapy, although I know that is not easy.  I know there is an effort to try to regularise the industry in a way that has not been done before, although it has been talked about for over 20 years in these buildings.  There has to be an urgency about it but I do not see that.  Nonetheless, I am not blaming the Minister of State for that and I am sure he is up against serious obstacles in trying to make it happen.<\/p> <p> Only this week, three psychotherapists came to see me to highlight some of the issues I have raised.  They are very conscious that, in this House, we change things around and we make things happen in lots of different areas, but it is very disappointing that we have not got to where we want to go in terms of making better use of all the psychotherapists in Ireland, who would make themselves available and who are interested in working.  As the Minister of State knows well, there are far more of them than there are psychologists and they are far more available.  We need some joined-up thinking.  It will mean a massive improvement in this whole area when we get to that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100025#BB00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548944400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State knows, the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, are extremely important.  Unfortunately, they are under-coordinated and under-resourced.  As many other speakers have said, early intervention is the key, preventing escalation to more serious mental health issues.  Intervention may not only involve the individual but may also involve the family, so there are wider issues in regard to adolescent mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, early intervention is the key and the main intervention is talk therapy, counselling and psychological intervention.  As Deputy Wallace said, there is a tendency to the overuse of medication.  If one is waiting months or years for treatment, the temptation is to medicate, which is perhaps not in the best interest of the patients.  It must be kept in mind that this is due to the difficulty in accessing talk and counselling services.  If medication is prescribed, which may be necessary, it should be for the shortest possible time to prevent overdependence on medication.  Early access is the key.<\/p>  <p>  The current issues in regard to young people are lack of self-confidence, lack of self-esteem, low mood and low motivation, which carries through into poor school performance.  Bullying and peer pressure in school can put severe pressure on individuals.  There is also the issue of sexual awareness, social media issues caused by social pressure, the issue of body image which can also be part of social media issues, domestic issues and family breakdown, homelessness and drug and alcohol abuse which unfortunately can be serious issues in adolescence.  These are all issues which need to be addressed but they can most commonly be addressed through counselling and talk therapy within primary care and do not necessitate referral to psychiatrists.  Psychiatry should be the last resort for adolescent mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is the CAMHS teams, which are under-resourced.  Many CAMHS teams are missing vital components.  Social workers are very important in CAMHS teams, as are counselling, psychotherapy and, of course, the psychiatrists themselves.  The national youth mental health services task force reported some two years ago with many recommendations.  One of the recommendations was for a national lead in youth mental health and to have a youth mental health lead in each CHO area.  I wonder what progress has been made in that regard.  There was also a proposal to set up an interdepartmental team, Pathfinder, which would oversee mental health policy and prioritise youth mental health initiatives.  What progress has been made in those areas?<\/p>  <p>  Overall, we must have early intervention and the co-ordination of our voluntary and community sector with our health services.  If there is better co-ordination, we will reduce waiting lists and improve early intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100026#CC00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1548944400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  We do not dedicate enough time to this very important issue, which is almost pushed under the carpet despite the serious issues that exist in our mental health services.  The mental health service for children and adolescents falls short of what is needed and is failing young people and their families.  We have got to a place where, as a society, we have become more comfortable in expressing our concerns around mental health and, in many ways, mental health awareness has never had a higher profile, with sufferers encouraged to seek help.  Sadly, currently we have neither the capacity nor the staffing in place to adequately respond to children and their families who are seeking help.  This beats all.  We need proper investment by the Government in mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  A Vision for Change recommended that 8.24% of total health spending should be directed to the mental health services but we are well below that target, which is not good enough in this day and age.  The demand for our mental health services is rising and therefore it is a no-brainer that funding for mental health services must also rise.  What is even more appalling is that A Vision for Change identified a progressive decline in the amount of expenditure being allocated to the mental health services, from 13% in 1984 to 7.3% in 2004.  Rather than reversing this reduction, this Government and previous ones have flatly ignored this finding, and the Government has continued to cut back on mental health services funding.  This is not acceptable by anyone's standards.<\/p>  <p>  Across the water, our neighbours in the UK spend 10% to 11% of the health budget on mental health services.  Why are we so behind in regard to investing in our mental health services in this country?  This chronic underfunding has manifested in a failure of State agencies to provide adequate mental health services to children and adolescents.  The Irish Medical Organisation has stated that good patient outcomes are most likely if patients have timely access to advice, assessment and treatment but, unfortunately, CAMHS is currently under-resourced and is still far below the level of capacity recommended.  This means each team is forced to serve a larger population, creating additional pressures on each team and longer waiting times for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is pushing for online services to be available to mental health patients but, in all honesty, if I was a parent of a child who needed to access the mental health services, I would not be jumping up and down if I was directed to go online to deal with the problems through a computer.  I would want to meet a person face-to-face to discuss the child's mental health issues and, from there, to come up with a treatment plan.  The last thing I would want is to talk to some robot in cyberspace.  The Minister of State needs to get real.  He needs to concentrate on providing a full service to children and adolescents whereby these children and their families can access real help on the ground and meet with a health professional face-to-face, and not wait months on end for appointments.  If the mental health service on the ground is running efficiently and meeting the patient's needs, maybe the Government could then look at investing in some sort of cyberspace app.  For now, it needs to look at the service being provided on the ground and to make sure families are being seen to in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot stand here today without mentioning my support for the psychiatric nurses and the other nurses and midwives.  Some 6,000 members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association have been left with no option but to engage in industrial action.  These nurses will refuse to work overtime today and tomorrow in a dispute over pay and staffing.  The Government is putting its head in the sand but it needs to wake up and realise the problems with recruitment and retention of nurses will not go away.  The Government needs to co-operate with nurses and listen to their concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100026#CC00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1548945000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle, for allowing time for this vital debate.  I will provide some context.  I was here, or nearly here, when A Vision for Change was introduced.  I had many a battle with the then Minister of State, John Moloney, when he introduced it.  We had a vision but that is all we had.  There was no funding, no jobs and nothing was put in place.  It is the 13th anniversary this year of that ten-year plan.  That sums it all up.<\/p>  <p>  I have nothing personal against the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  Deputy Neville is also present.  I compliment his father on all the years he spoke about it when it was not popular to talk about mental health.  He was a champion in that regard.  We all have a duty to pony up and deal with the issue.  There is an epidemic of suicide.  CAMHS in Tipperary has a waiting list of three to four years.  Adolescents are going into the paediatric ward in Clonmel.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he helped me as best he could when I discussed a case with him.  They were there for between seven and ten weeks waiting to go to the centre in Cork, which has difficulties with capacity.  I refer to troubled adolescents who were in the wrong environment and they did not need to be in a paediatric ward but in a special place where they could have someone to talk to.  There is a lack of psychologists and psychiatrists.  A Vision for Change did not provide one bed in Tipperary.  That is what it did for us.  It made sure that everyone was sent to Kilkenny, but Kilkenny does not want our patients because the hospital there is overrun with its own patients.  Deputy Aylward tells us that every day of the week.  That is no disrespect to the people in Kilkenny.  People have to travel there in taxis because no bus service is provided.  There are significant cracks in the system.  It is all a big crack.<\/p>  <p>  Four times as many people are dying from suicide as from road deaths.  I do not want any road deaths.  There was an horrific incident last weekend.  We are putting significant energy and effort into road safety at the moment but I think it is over the top, OTT.  Some of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, advertisements on television at the moment are nothing short of a disgrace.  They are having a mental health impact on young people.  The advertisement that is on the television should not be shown.  I have written to the director general, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Taoiseach.  It should not be shown because it is impacting on young people's health.  Unfortunately, tragedies happen, but four times the number of people die by suicide.<\/p>  <p>  I was at a funeral on Tuesday evening of a friend of mine who was failed by the system in Kilkenny.  It was a Tipperary patient who was not looked after.  There was another case in Cork of a very troubled woman whose grandfather was a Member of this House.  It is so sad.  I had a call this morning about a 75 year old man who was a friend of mine.  We all get such calls every day of the week.  There is an epidemic and we are not dealing with it.  The HSE is not fit for purpose to deal with the situation.  We talk about A Vision for Change and the ten-year plan, but here we are on its 13th anniversary and we have no plan and we have lost our vision.  We will need to get the cataract bus to make sure we have some kind of vision to see what we are doing or where we are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100027#DD00100","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1548945000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I thank Deputy McGrath for mentioning my father in the context of the debate on mental health and where it has come from since 2006.  As he correctly outlined, only a handful of people spoke about this issue at the time and we see many more people are elected now, across the political divide, who do so.  I very much welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody is saying the services are perfect or that there is not much work left to be done.  The mental health sector was the Cinderella of the health services for many years but a light is being shone on it politically more and more in recent years, in particular with this D&aacute;il following the election of Deputies from all parties and none with a specific interest in this area.  That has culminated in the production some months ago of a report by the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  Deputy Browne proposed that the committee would be set up, with the support of the Government.  A robust report was put together by the committee.  Other Members who were on the committee are present.  The report highlighted some of the issues involved and the nuts and bolts of the mental health service.  I again call for the committee to made permanent.  I seek an update from the Government on where we are at in terms of the establishment of the committee on a permanent footing.  The Minister of State will be aware that I am pushing the matter hard behind the scenes.  I would like to see that happen because I do not want us to take our foot off the gas.<\/p>  <p>  We started to shine a light on A Vision for Change and to investigate its implementation, not only from a political point of view but from the point of view of a management structure.  Such oversight is necessary for us as politicians to understand the intricacies of what is happening in the mental health services in order to be able to solve the problems.  It is easy to stand up here and make sweeping political statements to get headlines without understanding the nuts and bolts of what is going on behind the scenes.  It is incumbent on all of us to educate ourselves as much as possible on an issue such as this which is sensitive, and we must watch our language each time we speak about it.  I call on the Government, along with support from all the parties, to put the mental health committee on a permanent footing.  That would send a message from the Oireachtas and show that we are taking the issue seriously and putting it on the map.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a reduction in the number of people on the waiting list for CAMHS in the CHO 3 area, which covers Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare.  According to the figures from October 2018, the number of people waiting has reduced by approximately 45.  The service has had its challenges.  The major challenge with CAMHS is the global competition for consultant psychiatrists.  That is something we will have to try to resolve.  Previous speakers referred to the industrial dispute involving nurses in the PNA.  The PNA came before the committee and made a presentation to us.  I would very much welcome a solution to the industrial dispute that is going on at the moment concerning the pay agreement.  All sides must continue to work towards a solution.<\/p>  <p>  There have been developments in the mental health area more widely across government.  For example, in the education sector, 300 hours of well-being classes have been introduced in primary schools.  We need to start thinking outside of the mental health area and the health area generally and look to other sectors.  I know of private companies and organisations that are introducing mental health and well-being initiatives to deal with stress in the workplace.  There is a commercial kickback as people miss fewer days and are more productive at work.  That is starting to happen on the ground and I welcome such a development.  I would like more of a cross-departmental approach to mental health rather than a narrow approach.  More research and collaboration could be co-ordinated by the mental health committee and that could have a knock-on effect.  We speak all the time about early intervention, helping people, educating them and showing them how we can put patterns of resilience into place.  That could be though sports, the arts or employment.  Given that people spend most of their week at work, the workplace is an obvious place to focus.  In so doing, we could help people who fall between the cracks or who are in a vulnerable situation.  Organisations such as Jigsaw are important for youth mental health.  Another important body is the National Office for Suicide Prevention.<\/p>  <p>  The latest statistics I have show that the suicide rate in Limerick city reduced from 21.8 per 100,000 between 2013 and 2015 to 15.4 per 100,000 between 2014 to 2016.  I recognise the voluntary groups that operate in this area in Limerick city who do a lot of work with the public and provide intervention on the bridges as well.  That should not go unnoticed.  We must give credit where it is due.  It is a collaborative approach and we must work on it together.  We must be mindful of what we say so that we do not send the wrong message.  I understand Opposition parties highlighting where they see problems within the service but I do not want to send the message to the public that people cannot interact with the service or that they should not try to access services.  I implore people to approach the services if they are in a crisis situation.  I also implore them to go to their Deputies, friends, families or whoever else and to engage with the services if they require help.  We must be mindful of that.<\/p>  <p>  I know I am over my time.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for driving the mindfulness and mental health initiative within the Oireachtas.  There is a saying that charity begins at home.  We must not only preach to ourselves but we must practice it in order to send that message out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100027#DD00200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1548945000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I also welcome the opportunity to contribute on this issue.  I will pick up where Deputy Neville left off and commend the Ceann Comhairle.  He promoted some excellent initiatives last year together with Dr. John Hillery and several others from the College of Psychiatrists Ireland on mental health and mindfulness.  I reiterate all of the calls for the cross-party mental health group to be made a full committee of the House.  I have been listening to the debate and it is apparent that it is not just an issue for the Department of Health; it involves education, sport, rural affairs and every other Department.  If we do not have a single overarching committee doing fantastic work supervising that and monitoring it, then we will continue to have a silo mentality and people will get lost.  This is an all-party approach and we need a committee to oversee matters.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Browne, who since 2016 has brought significant energy to the issue within our party but also in pursuing budgetary allocations.  Were it not for his persistence, money would not have been ring-fenced for mental health services this year during the negotiations for the budgets for 2018 and 2019.<\/p><p>One good thing is that there is now a much greater awareness of mental health and much less stigma attached to approaching services for help.  However, the services were designed for a different era.  They have not caught up with demand or with the change in respect of early diagnosis.<\/p> <p> Deputy Neville referred to consultants.  We still have a major problem attracting consultants of any discipline to come to Ireland under the 2012 contract introduced by the then Minister, Senator James Reilly.  As long as that contract remains in place, there will continue to be vacancies.  This is not just an issue for mental health services, it applies across the board and we have to face up to that.  There is international competition for healthcare professionals, but we are exporting some of the best trained professionals in the world to Australia and Canada.  I spoke to some of them in recent weeks when they were home for Christmas.  They want to come home, but they will not do so while the contract to which I refer and the conditions in which they would be obliged to work remain in place.  We can fill these vacancies with our people.  It will not take a huge amount of money to revisit the issue of the contract.  There must be an awakening in the Department of Health in that regard.<\/p> <p> The role of social media in childhood and adolescent mental health issues is absolutely extraordinary.  I would not like to be a teenager in the current era.  It is tough enough to be a teenager at any time, but teenagers today must contend with the ubiquity of phones.  During the week, I heard my colleague, Councillor Cathal Crowe, talking about the latest craze on Snapchat.  Random fights on school buses are being recorded and posted online.  That is having an impact.  Pressure is being put on people in a way it never was before in the context of how they should look, how they should sound and to whom they should listen.  It is extraordinary.  We have to ensure that our services understand and are equipped to deal with this and that professionals within the services have an understanding of the impact of social media on daily lives.  Constant and aggressive training and reskilling are needed to keep ahead of these crazy practices.  The social media companies can no longer wash their hands of this.  We need more than just a Government response.  All the social media companies - these are multi-billion euro firms - must invest and take responsibility for the content that goes on their sites.<\/p> <p> There is massive frustration among people.  It is different in different regions.  There is no sense of co-ordination and the CHOs operate like silos.  The CHO in my area is facing many challenges but the people on the ground are working incredibly hard.  We still have one consultant psychologist post which has been approved but not filled, posts for doctors in training that have not been filled and posts for two social workers that have been approved and not filled.  The CAMHS inspection report from July indicates that an additional nine occupational therapists and 18 social workers are required.  That is the shortfall in just three counties.  I could go through the list.  Until we tackle the recruitment crisis in the healthcare sector generally, we can have all the statements, good intentions and support for services that we like but to no effect.  We have to fix that first, and then the Minister of State can start building a service that will deliver.<\/p> <p> I will finish where I began by stating that the Ceann Comhairle has done a massive amount of work.  I encourage him to encourage the Business Committee to place the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care on a permanent footing.  All parties would support such a development.  The kind of resources that the Committee on Public Accounts and other committees have must be allocated in respect of the joint committee in order to get it up and running and give it teeth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100027#DD00300","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548945600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Despite what I can only describe as the mantra of the Government regarding additional resources, extra staff, new facilities and so on, it must be clearly stated that mental health services and supports are nowhere near where they should be.  The Government states that funding towards mental health services has increased during its tenure to more than &euro;1 billion.  This may well be the case but just as with many other areas of the health service, increased funding is not having the effect it should.  Staff levels, recruitment and, most especially, retention are under severe pressure.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to place on record my solidarity with and support for all nurses across the State who were either on the picket lines yesterday or represented there by work colleagues.  I wish to extend the same good wishes to all our nurses who have emigrated and who, from London, Dubai, Australia and elsewhere, communicated their solidarity with their colleagues.  Psychiatric nurses are also due to commence industrial action this week.  This is attributable to exactly the same issues of pay and staffing levels.  Psychiatric nurses and other staff working in the sector have my complete and unwavering support.  I commend them and wish them success in their endeavours.<\/p>  <p>  Early intervention is critical when dealing with mental health issues.  It is absolutely essential, just as with any other illness.  Early intervention cannot happen if there are extensive waiting lists and a sheer lack of capacity.  In my CHO area, CHO 1, which covers my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the counties of Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal, there are ten vacant posts.  There are 40 young people who have been waiting between three and six months to be seen by CAMHS.  Some 38 have been waiting between six and nine months and 17 have been waiting as long as 15 months.  This is according to the most recent figures available.  A further 145 have been waiting for three months or less.  That is a total of 240 who are currently waiting.  This reality confirms a serious lack of capacity.  There is no other reason for these startling figures.  This issue is not political.  We all need to work together to address it.  The Government must first admit that there is a crisis and secondly embrace an all-party approach to delivering marked improvements.  I suggest that in all sincerity.  It is in all our interests to work together on improving mental health service provision.  Our young people are precious and they need our support.

Patrick is ten years old and he first engaged with the HSE services more than four years ago.  The family feel they have been let down for all that time.  In February of last year he was diagnosed with ADHD.  At the time, CAMHS suggested an autism assessment.  In June he was sent for an urgent assessment to the autism services in Sligo-Leitrim.  He has waited since then.  The email states:<\/p><blockquote>[W]e would like to ask you to get involved in a situation that is seriously affecting our family. A situation that, if left unchecked, has the potential to end in tragedy.<br \/><br \/>I have forwarded on to you a complaint that we made to the HSE today.  We feel the time has come for the services concerned to stop playing tennis with our lives. Passing the buck continuously between each other achieves no resolution. We all know that neither CAMHS nor Autism Services has the right person in post at present.  So they need to fund a service outside of Leitrim to support our little boy.<br \/><br \/>We feel that if this was the child of any member of government then the case would have been resolved in 7 days, not 7 months and we demand that our children be given the respect and support that is fair.<\/blockquote><p>This family is in absolute despair.  That lady has telephoned and emailed me about the situation several times in the past week.  I have contacted the services in Sligo-Leitrim.  Those services just do not have the necessary person in place.  The last thing we heard from them is that Dr. Mark O'Callaghan, the principal clinical psychologist, has suggested that the little boy will be referred to Dr. Yvonne Kelly.  There is already waiting list of two months at a minimum to see Dr. Kelly.  What are these families going to do?  The Minister of State indicated that there are 70 CAMHS teams.  How many of those are fully staffed?  As far as I can see, none of them are.  All of them probably have 50% of the required staffing.<\/p><p>These are serious situations.  If that child was at home with a broken leg, would he be left for seven months?  No, he would not.  He could not be.  We need to take the situation as seriously as that.

She has said that on 1 February she is going to go public.  I spoke to her before I came into the Chamber.  She told me to name her and her child.  I am not going to do that now.  It is time for the Government to realise that we have a crisis in CAMHS and autism services.  That is probably true of all parts of the country, but I am particularly interested in the north west.

It sounds promising, as though a service is being provided for young people with mental health issues. We know the mental health issues that young people face.  The Minister of State knows it from his own experience and I know it from my teaching and voluntary youth work.<\/p><p>I know the difference a service of support and an individual in a supported setting can make.<\/p> <p> The issues I would have seen at second level up to the time I left teaching ten years ago are those that are presenting now at a much younger age.  The mental health issues I would have been dealing with at second level are being seen in primary schools now.  I am talking particularly about self-harming, suicide ideation, aggressive behaviour, violent behaviour and serious threatening of classmates.  That is happening at a time when teachers and principals are snowed under with bureaucracy and endless amounts of paperwork.  I would say it is senseless paperwork in many cases in that it is not adding to the quality of the teaching or to the quality of the relationship between the student and the teacher, which is paramount when it comes to mental health issues.  It is the principal, the teachers, the guidance counsellor and the chaplain who will be responding to these issues initially, and for quite some time also, while they are waiting on services like CAMHS.<\/p> <p> Before speaking on this issue I asked two teacher friends - one at primary level and one at second level - for their reaction to the acronym \"CAMHS\".  From one I was told that the waiting lists are far too long and that CAMHS is more reactive than preventive.  They asked what a child needs to do to be guaranteed to see someone in CAMHS in a swift manner.  They said that communication with schools leaves a lot to be desired and as the referral is made by the GP the school can be left behind in the paper trail.  The other teacher said that CAMHS is very good when the child can be assessed but it looks as if it is over-burdened with every mental health issue.  That teacher made the point, which I am aware of also, that there is a gap in services in terms of the hard-to-find services for those between the teenage years and early adulthood.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p> Another reality is the statistics on the numbers waiting for an appointment.  The statistics from August 2018 show 2,453 waiting for an appointment, 169 waiting more than three months, and 313 waiting more than 12 months.  Do we have statistics on the presenting issues behind all those figures?  I wonder, and perhaps this does happen, if there is a type of triage service that indicates the different levels of urgency behind those particular cases.  I acknowledge the target of 72% being seen within 12 weeks.<\/p> <p> I saw the report from the National Youth Mental Health Task Force.  Its recommendations were sound in looking for a detailed assessment of services and supports currently available to identify gaps and to scope the improvements, but we know about the gaps.  Any school or youth project could tell the Minister of State at this moment what those gaps are and can also advise on what exactly is needed.<\/p> <p> We hear of the so-called normal mental health issues, and I use that word \"normal\" very loosely, for young people.  We also know the very negative mental health effects on those who are homeless.  However, we now have children who are homeless and the normal mental health issues of anxiety and stress are compounded for those young people who are living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  We are shoring up massive problems for CAMHS in the future.<\/p> <p> Returning to the point about CAMHS being reactive rather than preventive, I would point to the range of programmes for primary and second levels in the past such as Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet but they are very relevant today because of the material and the skills they sought to build.  I would also point to social, personal and health education, SPHE, and today we are moving into the Wellbeing programme.  Those programmes are all worthwhile and effective if the time allocated to them is sacrosanct and the teachers have the skills to deliver them.<\/p> <p> I agree with the Wellbeing programme but it must take account of the local area and local issues because there are areas of greater need and greater difficulty.  I know what children in the north inner city have been facing, including the violence and the murders they have seen in their community.  They see active addiction, people smoking, shooting up and injecting.  They see the paraphernalia of drug addiction.  Some of them are being intimidated into dealing drugs and some of them have family members who are dealing.  Families are being intimidated also over drug debt.  The Wellbeing programme must be cognisant of that, recognise the issues in an area or a community and be specific to those areas.<\/p> <p> Wellbeing is a preventive programme.  I know the demands on the school curriculum.  We saw the committee report on relationship and sexuality education the other day but what is needed is a programme in critical thinking that can be applied to any situation or any mental health, relationships or sexuality issue.  Wellbeing is also about physical health and physical education and games are important in that respect.  None of the preventive measures could help with delays in accessing CAMHS but they could prevent some people having to access CAMHS.  The schools and youth projects are picking up the pieces while young people are waiting on CAMHS.  They were the youth projects that suffered so many cuts in the past.<\/p> <p> Substance abuse service specific to youth, SASSY, is an organisation where children and young people can self refer.  Parents and teachers can refer also for those who have addiction issues.  I believe we could examine that model and support it even more.<\/p> <p> It is about joined-up thinking in terms of mental health issues of young people.  I refer to the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Justice and Equality, Education and Skills and now Communications, Climate Action and Environment also because of social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100028#EE00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548946200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State is aware, there is an ongoing crisis in children's mental health services.  Thirteen years after the publication of A Vision for Change, the services are still completely understaffed.  Too many children continue to be admitted to adult units.  Waiting lists and waiting times are long and a renewed focus is needed to reduce deficiencies in the services.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been a visitor to my county and I know he is passionate about this issue.  In my area I have found that the source of the problem is recruitment and the staffing issue.  For example, in July last year, the number of vacancies fell from 51 to ten, which was a positive development in the service.  However, there are 248 children currently on the waiting list to be seen.<\/p>  <p>  All of us have had different experiences of parents coming to us with their children, some of whom are very young, who need that assistance and intervention.  The effects of that spill over into their attendance at school, their ability to go to school which is something most children take for granted.  We cannot emphasise enough the importance of proper mental health services within our regions.<\/p>  <p>  An issue that arose was of children being admitted to adult units.  I am sure many Deputies are aware of similar problems.  I was not really aware of that until parents came to me about it.  I refer to one young first year student who was being admitted to an adult service.  The parents were more than shocked and as a result they refrained from taking up that hospital bed because they felt it was not the right place for their child and would add to his illness. That meant they had to give 24-hour care to their child at home.  They had three other children in the house.  I am not sure how they managed that but they were insistent that was the only way to deal with their child's problem because going into an adult bed or unit was not appropriate for the child.  We are all in agreement that is not the way to deal with children who suffer from mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The number of children admitted to adult mental health units stood at 65 as of September 2018.  If this trend was to continue for the remaining months of 2019, up to 86 or 87 vulnerable young children will be inappropriately accommodated this year, a number that will exceed the previous year.  The total number so far is greater than that in 2016 and shows that the standards in this area have regressed, having improved for a number of years prior to that.  The Mental Health Commission said it is a clear breach of human rights and in terms of a child's dignity.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, we also saw a 20% increase in the number of children admitted to adult mental health units.  That is unacceptable and it is not the right way to deal with this problem.  It is also contrary to State policy.  It is especially disappointing as there has been progress in previous years and to see that halt, and in some cases reverse, is an indictment of the way we are treating children with mental health conditions.<\/p>  <p>  We are also concerned that the Department of Health does not track the number of times a child has been readmitted to the same adult mental health unit.  The A Vision for Change mental health strategy made clear that Ireland needs at least 100 beds for children and adolescent patients to meet the demand.  However, the closure of beds during 2017 meant that at one stage just 52 beds were available for children and adolescent patients.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot emphasise to the Minister of State how passionately I feel about this issue.  I know the Minister does also, as do many Members in the House.  We all know children, be they relations or constituents, whose parents come to us about this issue.  It is usually the last chance saloon for them because they have tried all the other options available to them.<\/p>  <p>  School principals are up against it in terms of keeping their students in school because when a mental health issue gets a grip on young people it is very difficult for them to get control.  Parents and schools need this support.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of putting the funding into this area and ensuring that A Vision for Change really is a vision for change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100029#FF00500","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1548946800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  While there are still many challenges in the area of the provision of mental healthcare, the one positive thing that has happened in recent years is that we are now talking about it an awful lot more freely than we ever did.  It has been destigmatised and it is okay for people to talk about their mental health in a way that they never would have.  People do not feel vulnerable about doing so.  In that regard, I welcome the fact that we have debates such as this on a regular basis in this House.  I compliment the work that the Ceann Comhairle has done on this over the past 12 to 18 months.  Many Members are contributing to the destigmatisation of mental health in a positive manner.  If anything good has come from recent years, that has.<\/p>  <p>  However, as previous speakers have outlined, there are still many challenges.  It is not good enough that we can now talk about it as freely as we can talk about our physical health if the supports and services are not in place for the people who have an issue with their mental health and they cannot access help.  Previous speakers have outlined the long waiting lists, the fact that adolescents and children are cared for in adult wards and the unacceptable practices that continue to prevail.  We need to address that in a meaningful way but we will not be able to do so unless the Government starts to consult the medical profession and deals with the challenges it is facing.  If those challenges are not addressed, we will not be able to recruit the relevant people across the various disciplines and services where they are needed.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the many community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations working in this area.  Without them, the waiting lists would be more severe.  I am thinking of Good 2 Talk in Mullingar, which is a free or low cost counselling service if people can afford to give some money.  The Minister of State is aware of it and we have engaged on it previously.  I mention the challenges and the bureaucratic form filling and procedures that it has to go through every year to get a small percentage of its annual funding from the HSE.  I refer to the Transformative College in Mullingar.  It comprises a group of people who set up a caf&eacute; where people can go to learn new things and engage with others.  It does not even have a permanent home anymore.  A caf&eacute; in Mullingar is allowing the college to use its facilities a number of nights a week when it closes.  The college is operating on a shoestring.  When it goes to the HSE to seek funding, obstacles are put in its way instead of the HSE telling it that it is doing fabulous work and asking how the HSE can help to make things easier.<\/p>  <p>  Before Christmas, I visited the Athlone Institute of Technology.  It is a third-level institution with in excess of 6,000 pupils.  The level of service being provided there is simply scandalous.  A protest was carried out by the students asking for greater supports.  This is the time in life when people transition from a family environment where they have the support of their parents to living on their own.  If the Minister of State takes anything on board from my contribution, I ask him to consider how dedicated supports can be provided to that cohort of individuals.  I am talking about third level students and I am using Athlone Institute of Technology as an example.  The Minister of State needs to go back and look at the good work of the cross-party group on mental health.  It was an initiative of my colleague, Deputy Browne, and it was embraced by the Government.  Unfortunately, it was time specific and the Minister of State needs to look at reconstituting that committee and letting us work together in a collaborative approach to see how we can address the many challenges that currently exist with positive mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100030#GG00100","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1548946800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>CAMHS is an area in which I have taken an interest.  Part of my interest stems from an experience I had before I was elected, when I spoke to a community mental health nurse I was representing about an allowance that he may have been due.  He asked if I minded him leaving his phone on during the meeting because he had several children in his care who were effectively on suicide watch.  I am grateful for that experience in a way because it was something that I had not encountered until that point and I was struck by the fact that this person was trying to provide a service in strained circumstances and was trying to do his best but he was very stretched.  It had not occurred to me that this need was there among children and adolescents and I did not know about the extent of that need.  I talked to people who provide that service and they are fantastic.  The Minister of State will acknowledge that they are working in very strained circumstances.  They would like to do more and they would like to provide a real safety net.  I know from speaking with people in my community that youth mental health is a particular concern and people want to able to see those services and that safety net provided because they can see that not having those services in place for children can lead to problems in later life.  The longer they go without help, the harder it is when that help eventually arrives, if it arrives when they are adults.<\/p>  <p>  There is no one, in this Chamber or outside it, whose life has not been touched by a mental health issue, either concerning themselves, their family, their friends or people in their community.  We have become very aware of the scale and disparate nature of mental health illness recently and I say that to refer to my initial point that I was not aware of the extent to which child and adolescent mental health was such an issue, that help was so badly needed and what could be done when it was done right.  People are now starting to talk about the scale and the challenge that is posed by consistent and persistent underfunding of services which leads to understaffing.<\/p>  <p>  A cursory look at the state of affairs reveals that the CAMHS service has barely half of the necessary staff needed under A Vision for Change.  I recall when the strategy was launched.  It was a ten-year project but it is now 12 years' old.  It has ceased to have any meaning because so much of it remains unimplemented.  Waiting lists for a first assessment have gone through the roof.  At the end of October, 2,250 children in my area were waiting to access services, 286 of whom were waiting more than a year simply to access their first appointment.  Some 105 of those young people had been waiting in excess of 18 months.  It gets to the stage where none of this can be called early intervention because of the length of the wait.  It ceases to be early intervention.  In my community of Fingal, we only have 63% of the staff necessary for CAMHS with 177 young people waiting for a first assessment.  Every expert in child and adolescent mental health says that early intervention is vital to avoid enduring and worsening problems into the future.  I do not need to convince the Minister of State of that because he is aware of it but we only have 63% of the staff necessary.  I represent an area that has one of the youngest populations in Europe and the number of young people is growing quickly.<\/p><p>That is brilliant but the services are not there for them.  We do not have enough people to provide those services.<\/p> <p> Mental health issues are emergency health issues.  The Minister of State would not expect someone with a physical health emergency to wait over a year for treatment, yet young people with mental health problems are expected to wait.  In 2019, we need to see increased and targeted investment from this Government to help those soaring waiting lists and ensure people can access the services they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100030#GG00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548947400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I am glad to be here to participate in the discussion.  The comments I will make have been prepared for me by the excellent Emma Smith, a young transition year student, with whom we have had the pleasure of working in our offices during recent weeks.  She makes the point that in discussing this matter we must start by recognising that CAMHS has been a vital source of aid for young people who struggle with a form of mental illness, a learning difficulty, a speech issue and so on, and also for their families.  It is vital.  The level of interest in the debate today shows that.<\/p>  <p>  We must view CAMHS in the context that, thanks to years of austerity, it has been chronically underperforming.  It is the young people and their families who are being put under an unbearable strain as a result of that situation.  The numbers of people on waiting lists are scandalous.  As of September 2018, we know 1,369 young people had been on the list for more than three months, 470 had been on it for more than six months, 241 had been on it for nine months, 222 had been on it for more than a year and so on.  In my area, 46 vulnerable young people were left waiting for an appointment for more than six months.  That is incredible and a cause for extreme concern.  Six months is far too long to leave a young person to suffer, particularly because he or she is at a crucial stage of his or her development and any delay can and will have life-long consequences for him or her.  Not only that, but with the services being in such catastrophic disarray, they were putting young people at serious risk.  It has been said that 70 children under the age of 16 years died by suicide in Ireland last year.  That is devastating.  We, as a Parliament, must ask how can we standby and allow this to happen?<\/p>  <p>  Waiting lists are inevitable when staff numbers have been dropping relentlessly.  The services are only operating at roughly half the recommended number of full-time staff.  We must be honest about that.  The staff numbers in CAMHS are down for the same reason they are down in the Defence Forces and nursing, namely, because there is a recruitment and retention crisis.  Years of cuts have resulted in staff being seriously overworked and overworked staff who have been kicked around by successive Governments for years do not tend to stick around if they can get out at all.  Unfortunately, that is the situation we are in.  The Government tells us we are out of the austerity woods but it fails to recognise the importance of the scars that have been left right across our public service.  In this case, it is vulnerable children.<\/p>  <p>  We know many regions in the country have next to no professionals.  There are only 84 working to provide assessments and treatments for all of Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath and Louth.  Worse again, there are only 49 for Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford and south Tipperary, which have a population of nearly half a million people.  The chronic understaffing has meant that children are being inappropriately admitted into adult mental health inpatient units.  The fact that there were 82 admissions in 2017 is utterly shocking.  I cannot imagine how devastating it must be for a child, particularly a sick and vulnerable child, to experience something like that.  Worse again, we know that the low levels of staff are inadequately trained, and such inadequately trained staff in inpatient units means that seclusion and physical restraint are becoming normalised, which is an horrific prospect.  Children suffering from a mental illness are getting no better treatment than in the Victorian asylums that operated in the past.  For those children who are treated by CAMHS, care plans, individually formulated to suit the patient, are time and again overlooked despite the fact that all the evidence shows that these plans are the cornerstone of a successful recovery.<\/p>  <p>  We need to address these shortfalls or an entire generation who so desperately require help and guidelines will be left behind.  It is important we recognise that it is not about quantity over quality.  Pressure on staff to get people through the system has become immense.  A stress on numbers turns cases into quotas.  It is no longer about helping a child adequately but instead it becomes about doing as little as possible for as many possible.  That is not a solution.  This is the institutionalisation of improper care.  If the issues with CAMHS are not solved, it will go down as one of our country's biggest failures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100031#HH00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1548947400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I want to place on record my disappointment that these services are not appropriately staffed with the qualified people who are necessary to deal with the numbers who are turning up for the services.  I have seen that at first hand in Kilkenny.  In the psychiatric services generally, we can see that there are patients there who have been inappropriately placed because there is no place else for them to go.  The centre in Kilkenny city, which caters for a number of counties in the south east, has been overwhelmed by the numbers who turn up for care.  When a person in this situation, who requires treatment, counselling and supports, is put on a waiting list, that does not work for them.  Something is required for them in real time and that is not happening for them.<\/p>  <p>  When we go down the line into the community services and beyond, we find there are a number of agencies, some HSE and some HSE-funded, that are cobbling together hours of care for patients who need 24-7 care or for children who have a difficulty with mental health issues.  That is not good enough.  The plan might look okay and appear fine on paper but I have attended many meetings with parents concerning their child or, in some cases, children with the HSE and I am always taken aback by the fact that those on the front line are making every effort, but the plans they are putting in place are unrealistic.  The range of services required are not there.  Like nurses in general hospitals, I am inclined to believe that for those in psychiatric hospitals or in the department of psychiatry in my area, who are under so much pressure that it not an attractive position any more.  They could cope with their own workload but they are trying to respond to a demand from individuals and families they cannot just meet.  They do not have the professional capacity to deal with it.  It is desperate to see families struggle in circumstances like this and the ports of call, namely, the HSE or the professionals, are simply not there.<\/p>  <p>  Something must be done to arrange appropriate care and to fund it.  The only way to deal with it is in the context of acknowledging there is a problem in the workplace for those who are qualified and that there is a problem of under-capacity in terms of the qualified people who are necessary to deal with these issues.  In Kilkenny alone one weekend, there were three suicides.  There was another funeral today of a young man who died by suicide.  All that can be traced back to their younger years and the fact they were neglected in some way as they went through the services.  Some fell through the cracks and some did not get the service required.  That is an awful reflection on the HSE and its management systems that do not deliver.<\/p>  <p>  The community model of decongregation in some cases and community homes are all affected by this.  They do no have the number of professionals required to deal with the cases they have.  As a result, the individuals suffering from mental health issues are getting worse.<\/p><p>If they are not treated, they carry it on to the next phase of development of that issue and it becomes deeper and more difficult to deal with.<\/p> <p> If we are making these representations to the HSE and drawing these cases to its attention, one would imagine that it would see the pressure that staff are under and the necessity of getting professionals in to make the job better and make a concentrated attempt to deliver the services to the doorstep of the person involved if necessary.  In many cases of which I am aware - some of them involved inappropriate referrals to the department of psychiatry in Kilkenny - people turn up for services and are left on chairs and in beds in corridors waiting to be admitted.  In two instances, while people were waiting to be admitted, they left the services and others had to be called in to carry out a search-and-rescue mission.  That is not good enough.  The type of services required to deal with this need to be put in place and available on demand.  Unfortunately, that is the way it is with mental health.  Will the Minister of State confirm the funding and also indicate how this issue is going to be addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100031#HH00300","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548948000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank the Members from various parties for their contributions, my officials to my right and the civil servants in the Department who have helped prepare for this and studiously taken note of the contributions that have been made.  Rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.  On a more serious note, nobody has a monopoly on wisdom regarding the right thing to do in respect of mental health.  We all acknowledge that we have come a long way in our recognition of this issue and in our ability to destigmatise and speak more freely about it and the challenges to which it gives rise.<\/p>  <p>  CAMHS is a specialist service within the mental health services.  A multitude of other services are available in the context of mental health but CAMHS relates to young people and attracts much attention.  As stated earlier, I met the CHO and clinical leads in the nine CHOs in the last ten days.  I informed them that I would not run a waiting list initiative and that I would much prefer to deal with the structural challenges that exist within the area of mental health.  We have made significant progress in respect of those challenges.  I am of the view that meeting them is the key to the future.  It would be worth Deputies' time informing themselves and becoming more aware of the changes that are happening.  I held a briefing in the audiovisual room in November.  I am of the view that it was a helpful exercise; it certainly was for me.  It allowed the Members in attendance to question some departmental and HSE officials and get more accurate information.  A contribution was made here today which spoke about telepsychiatry and telepsychology as speaking to a robot on a screen.  That level of ignorance is not helpful and people should make an effort before commenting on specific initiatives to at least inform themselves.  That is not universal but a very isolated incident.  I think most people take more care to research what they are talking about.<\/p>  <p>  We have three specific proposals that I hope to advance in the coming year.  One relates to telepsychiatry and telepsychology.  The latter do not constitute a silver bullet but they offer alternatives to address the recruitment issue because we cannot keep saying we have a recruitment problem.  We have to look at new ways of delivering mental health care.  The mental health telephone line training will begin on 7 February for the National Ambulance Service.  We will have a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week telephone line that will be manned by professionally qualified mental health staff.  There is already demand for that with up to 800 calls a month going to the National Ambulance Service which are related to mental health which it does not have expertise to deal with and where sending ambulance is not the answer except in a tiny minority of cases.  We will have appropriately trained people taking those calls 24 hours a day and referring people to services.  Some 1,027 different mental health services are funded by the HSE but many people do not know where they are or how to access them.<\/p>  <p>  The other fundamental thing we are doing is building a further level of infrastructure underneath CAMHS.  We made significant progress on that last year when we hired 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists.  We need to continue to build on that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace made many interesting points about the over-medicalisation of mental health and the importance of psychotherapy and talking therapies being introduced along with early intervention and support in primary care.  We are making significant progress on that to build that level underneath CAMHS.  There is an over-reliance on CAMHS.  Many people do not need to avail of CAMHS who are being referred to them.  There are more appropriate options but, due to the lack of alternatives, people are referred to CAMHS.  The key to successfully dealing with the CAMHS waiting lists is decreasing our reliance on it.  We will open a crisis text line this year.  International evidence has shown that this works well.  Young people are much happier and more free to text and will be more likely to do that than to pick up the phone or approach a mental health professional.  We have to ensure that we roll that out successfully and I believe we will do so.  Those are some of the digital platforms, and we will also roll out cognitive behavioural therapy.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have time to address all of the points relating to A Vision for Change, an extraordinarily ambitious document which was launched in 2006.  We cannot forget what happened in the country after 2006 when the economy crashed and a great deal was lost.  Much was achieved in the context of A Vision for Change over a ten-year period.  If the Sl&aacute;intecare report achieves anything like A Vision for Change achieved, we will have top-notch healthcare.  I will be the first to admit that we have a long way to go.  We do not want to have waiting lists.  We want more people to reach out for the services and we do not want them to be discouraged by waiting lists.  Structural reform is required.  There is no quick fix or easy solution.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Members for their contributions.  I hope to facilitate another engagement in the audiovisual room in another month or two to which I will invite Members.  We can have a further question-and-answer session at that point..

I acknowledge the work done by Deputy Quinlivan, who has been a strong advocate for measures to tackle ticket touting.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt about the public concern and anger that exists about the resale of tickets at inflated prices.  Music or sports fans who are unable to get tickets for a concert or match that they want to attend understandably feel annoyed when they see tickets for sale on secondary websites at a multiple of the face value price.  Their annoyance is all the greater when tickets are on offer on secondary websites at the very start of a general ticket sale or even before it in some cases.  Disappointed fans naturally want to know how this can happen and what can be done to tackle it.  I fully share the concerns of Deputies and the public on the issue.  In July, I secured Government approval for taking the Second and later Stages of the Bill in Government time and for the drafting of amendments.  The Bill&rsquo;s Second Reading this evening is being taken in Government time.<\/p>  <p>  In December, my Department submitted a number of amendments to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and my officials are currently engaging with the Parliamentary Counsel on these.  My predecessor, the then Minister, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, launched a public consultation on ticket resale in 2017, along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport.  They took this step because it was clear to them that, despite the amount of commentary on the issue, there was a lack of reliable information on many aspects of ticket resale, including the extent to which it was happening, the sources of the tickets that end up for resale on the secondary market and the prices achieved as opposed to advertised for tickets sold on that market.  The responses to the public consultation and the subsequent discussions with stakeholders showed widespread, although not universal, support for legislation such as that before the House.<\/p><p>A statutory ban on the resale of tickets above their face value was backed by two of the three main sporting bodies, namely the GAA and the FAI; the two main event promoters, namely Aiken Promotions and MCD; the Consumers Association of Ireland; and a number of public representatives and consumers.  Many leading artists and entertainers have also expressed their disapproval of the secondary ticket market.  Opposition to a statutory cap on ticket resale prices came mainly from primary ticketing services providers and secondary ticket platforms.  In a significant development, however, Ticketmaster announced in August 2018 that it was closing its secondary resale websites, Seatwave and Get Me In!, and would launch a fan-to-fan ticket exchange in which tickets will be able to be resold for no more than their original price.  While commercial considerations no doubt played a part in this decision, it was evidence of the growing hostility to the secondary ticket market from fans, sporting bodies, promoters and entertainers.  In its statement Ticketmaster indicated that its fan exchange would be launched in Ireland and the UK in October 2018.  While the fan exchange appears to be up and running in the UK, it has yet to commence here.  I hope there will be no further delay in its roll-out as it will be important, particularly after the enactment of this Bill, that people with unwanted tickets have secure and readily accessible platforms on which they can offer tickets for sale at face value or below.<\/p> <p> While figures can vary from year to year, the number of entertainment events that give rise to a level of resale is typically in the region of 50 per year.  It is often when major acts are performing that the problem is most acute.  We have seen examples of this in recent years, with tickets for acts such as U2, Britney Spears and the Spice Girls sold online for vastly inflated prices.  Similarly, the sporting events that generally give rise to a significant level of resale tend to be the more high-profile fixtures and events.  For example, I am aware that tickets were available online this week for the Ireland-England rugby match for thousands of euro.  We have seen similar experiences in the past for all-Ireland finals and semi-finals and for high-profile games involving the Irish soccer team.  In this regard I welcome the decision by the GAA last year to cancel tickets for the all-Ireland hurling and football finals which were found to have been sold online above face value.  Of course, there will always be issues of supply and demand.  Croke Park can only hold 82,000 people, so if 90,000 people want to go there, there will always be disappointment for those who miss out.  I believe this Bill will help to ensure that genuine fans are given the greatest chance possible to get tickets to see their teams play.  It should never be the case that tickets simply go to those who have the deepest pockets.<\/p> <p> I am confident that legislation along the lines proposed in the Bill will reduce the level of above-face-value resale.  I await advice from the Office of the Attorney General as to whether the Bill and the proposed amendments will need to be notified to the European Commission under Directive 2015\/1535 on the procedure for the provision of information relating to technical regulations and the rules for information society services.  Officials of my Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are working on amendments to the Bill.  The proposed amendments will be moved on Committee or Report Stage.<\/p> <p> As I have indicated previously, one of the amendments will deal with the use of bot software to get around limits on the number of tickets that can be purchased by a single buyer.  I propose to prohibit the use of bots for this purpose as well as to prohibit the sale of tickets obtained through the use of bots.  Action on this issue was one of the few measures on which there was support from all sides in responses to the public consultation.  People seeking to profiteer from the resale of tickets should not be permitted to use unfair means to acquire large numbers of tickets.<\/p> <p> I propose also to table an amendment prohibiting the unauthorised sale of tickets for the Euro 2020 football tournament.  A commitment to introduce such a provision was given to UEFA as part of the bid for the staging of a number of matches here during the tournament.  I will propose a number of other changes aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and enforcement of the Bill.<\/p> <p> While the Bill currently applies to specified events with an expected attendance of over 300, I favour its application to designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or over.  Applying the legislation to known designated venues rather than on an event-by-event basis would facilitate its enforcement.  A capacity threshold of 1,000 would also capture virtually all the venues where events are likely to give rise to ticket resale.<\/p> <p> I am happy to hear the views of Deputies on other possible changes to the Bill.  I thank Deputies Rock and Donnelly for initiating this important and worthwhile Bill.  The fact that Second Stage is being taken in Government time shows the strong commitment on the part of Government to support the Bill.  I thank the officials in my Department, who have put a huge amount of work into putting together the Bill.  I look forward to hearing all the contributions and I hope we can have cross-party support to ensure we get the Bill enacted as soon as possible in order that genuine fans are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100032#JJ00400","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548948600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I express my gratitude to Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the co-drafter of the Bill.  He has been great to work with, brought a lot of common sense and economic capacity to the discussion and, above all, shown how productive, positive politics can work, so I thank the Deputy.  It does not all have to be a Punch and Judy show, which is what people experience all too often when watching the proceedings of the Houses on the television or the news.  We do not have to be at one another's throats all the time or oppose for opposition's sake.  Remarkably, this Bill is set to be the first Private Members' legislation initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael jointly to become law, should it conclude all Stages.  When introduced, the Bill was the first legislation co-sponsored by backbench Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I also set down my praise for Deputy Quinlivan.  I know that this is an issue of importance to him and on which he has advocated both in the Chamber and on the airwaves for some time now.  This shows there is a recognised problem here.  No one has recognised this problem more than the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, so I wish to highlight the vital role the Minister and the team within her Department have played.  Since her first week in office, the Minister has been a tireless champion of this legislation.  I am grateful for that, as I believe are the 91% of the Irish public who support this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Bill itself and the problem it seeks to solve are relatively straightforward.  As the Minister said, it should never be the case that tickets to concerts or matches go only to those with the deepest pockets.  Technology has allowed people to distort the market.  We have seen time and again real people, real families and real fans bullied off the pitch by people who buy with the sole intention of making a quick profit despite having done nothing.  I ask the Acting Chairman to consider the following.  Tickets are strictly finite: we cannot make more of them.  We cannot have a second all-Ireland final.  Granted, we can have a replay every now and then.  As the Minister said, if 90,000 people want to go to a venue that holds 82,000 people, 8,000 people may be left disappointed.  Nevertheless, they should at least have a fair crack at being inside the stadium in the first place.  It is predictable and well flagged which events will sell out.  We always know this in advance.  It is possible, sometimes at a price, to buy one's way to the front of the queue, what I call asymmetric access to the market.  Sometimes one can get advance access to the market by being a member of a certain mobile phone company or a customer of a certain utility company; sometimes one can simply pay a fee up front to be a member of a fan club of a band or a sports club.  This distorts the market.  Is this a normal market then?  Is it right, is it fair and does it add value to our economy?  \"No\", \"no\", \"no\" and \"no\" are the answers to those questions, and I believe that this is ultimately what was found by the consultation undertaken by the Department to try to separate the truth from the distortion in respect of this market.  Yet ticket-touting is still taking place, and in greater numbers than ever.  We see the prevalence of ticket-touting and the number of people having to resort to buying tickets from the secondary market growing year on year.<\/p><p>This is the case in many countries, not just Ireland.  That is why Deputy Donnelly and I introduced the Bill.<\/p> <p> This Bill will effectively ban the above-cost reselling of tickets.  That is all; it is straightforward.  If someone has a ticket that they need to offload it at face value, they will still be able to do so.  If someone finds that, for whatever reason, he or she cannot go to a soccer game between Ireland and Georgia, a rugby game between Ireland and England or a Miley Cyrus or Taylor Swift concert, he or she will still be able to his or her ticket at face value, in a fair way in order to ensure that he or she does not lose out.  What we are trying to ensure does not happen is the hoarding of tickets.  That is happening now.  People buy tickets with the sole intention of cornering the market, driving up the price, reselling the tickets and making a profit, having had no input whatsoever.<\/p> <p> In drafting this Bill, we drew on the work of other parliaments, such as the Belgian Parliament, as well as the work of Deputies, past and present, within Fine Gael.  The initial work of the current Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, Deputy Denis Naughten and the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, some 21 years ago, paved the way for the Bill.<\/p> <p> This Bill is straightforward consumer legislation.  There is a clear skewing of the market against the consumer and there have been various examples of other such consumer protection legislation.  The ethos of minimum wage laws run parallel to that of this Bill, which is to say that the market is not the best way of deciding how things should be governed.  There is a need for intervention and regulation.  That is the case with mobile phone roaming fees whereby a cap is set on the amount that people can be charged when they go abroad.  That is consumer protection legislation.  In minimum wage laws, we say there has to be a basement level above which people must be paid.  We cannot simply let companies set the level at which people are paid.  As a Government, a Parliament and a society, we set a minimum wage law.  Certain interventions made by Government are positive for consumers, society and the population.<\/p> <p> I am proud to be proposing a Bill which every consumer association has spoken in favour of and which is based on a principle that every party in the D&aacute;il has spoken in favour of at one point or another.  The GAA is in favour of this.  The IRFU representatives I met were in favour of this.  The FAI is in favour of this.  As the Minister pointed out, our hosting of Euro 2020 games will require legislation such as this.  This is not simply a trivial whim, this is something we must do, in one form or another.  I am glad that the Minister is taking action.<\/p> <p> Sometimes people ask why we cannot do this kind of thing in respect of other sectors.  Theoretically, one could, but, in the case of, say, housing, the best solution is more supply, as well as interventions and subsidies, to make housing affordable and accessible for people.  The market this Bill addresses is very different.  It is an easily identifiable problem that is easily solved.  It has been solved in other countries and we can do it here.<\/p> <p> There has been a lot of distortion, lobbying and inaccuracy about the constitutionality of this Bill.  Certain companies have spent tens of thousands of euro fighting and opposing it in the media and through lobbying on Merrion Street and Kildare Street.  Some have not correctly declared their engagement in lobbying.  They have set out to muddy the waters and delay the legislation.  We have been delayed for the past two years.  If one includes the work of Alan Shatter and Deputy Denis Naughten, we have been delayed for the past 21 years enacting legislation on this.  That delay, thanks to the action of the Minister, is coming to an end.<\/p> <p> One of the main issues of distortion featured in an article in a prominent daily newspaper on Saturday about the issue of constitutionality and property rights etc.  This is rubbish.  The terms and conditions of one of the most prominent ticketing companies reads, \"Any ticket you purchase from us remains the property of the relevant event partner and is a personal, revocable licence which may be withdrawn and admission refused at any time.\"  It is not property.  The consumer does not own the ticket at any point.  It is a token by which the consumer gains access to an event.  It is not property so it does not interfere with constitutional property rights whatsoever and it is disingenuous to claim otherwise, it muddies the waters and it tries to make people believe this Bill is something it is not.  It is simple consumer protection legislation.  It is an attempt to level the playing field so that regular fans, regular people, be they sports fans or music fans, have the same access to tickets as anybody else.  He or she who shows up first gets first dibs on a ticket.  It is not the case that whoever has the deepest pockets controls the market anymore.<\/p> <p> I am a sports fan.  Some Deputies are music fans.  I gather from Deputy Donnelly's press release yesterday that he is an Ariana Grande fan.  We were all surprised to hear that, but, to paraphrase E.M. Forster, democracy loves variety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100033#KK00200","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548949200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>It takes all types.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100034#LL00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1548949200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>We all have a reason to back and believe in this Bill.

I thank the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation which has played a constructive role in the consultation and I thank the Minister for facilitating that and driving it forward.

This is a Private Members' Bill and we may have been able to get it to Second Stage as a Private Members' Bill but the chances are that it certainly would not have gone any further than that.  The Bill has the backing of the Minister and I know she has spent a considerable amount of time on it.  I have met her to discuss it on several occasions.  Our hope is that it will become law.  I want to recognise that it would not have happened without the Minister and I thank her for that.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the huge amount of work that Deputy Rock has done on this over a considerable period.  He has been intimately involved in it and we would probably not be here without him championing the Bill and without his input, expertise and passion, and the work he has done with the Minister.  I acknowledge Deputy Rock's work.  I also acknowledge Deputy Quinlivan, who had his own legislation on this issue, which passed Second Stage.  I know this is an issue on which he has done much work and which he takes seriously.  I acknowledge the officials in the Department who did an enormous amount of work on this.  I recognise what they and their colleagues have done.<\/p>  <p>  The Chairman looked a little confused at the mention of Ariana Grande.  Anyone who has teenage or tweenage kids knows exactly who she is.  Tickets for her concerts in Ireland went on sale recently.  They sold out in the blink of an eye.  Those tickets were on sale for &euro;70 and they are now on sale for hundreds of euro on the secondary sites.  Under our current law, the sky is the limit for those organised ticket touts.  Imagine that kind of pressure every day.  All the standard tickets are sold out but these others are available if a kid can convince his or her mum or dad to shell out the money to a tout.<\/p><p>All that pester power means that even the toughest parents can be worn down when they see their kids devastated with no tears left to cry.  It is not fair.  It is time for us to break free from these ticket touts.  It is not just music fans and their long-suffering parents who are set to benefit from the Bill.  Sports fans will see how it works for them too.  Ireland will play England on Saturday in the Six Nations Championship.  Tickets for that match went on sale at &euro;65.  If anyone listening to proceedings has a ticket they would like to sell me at &euro;65, let me know.  I would happily buy it but people who want to go to the match know that those same tickets are now up for sale on the secondary sites.  I checked yesterday and they were starting at &euro;350.  I saw them go up to &euro;1,500.  I imagine by the end of the day tomorrow they will be even higher.  The Bill will make it an offence for anyone to sell a ticket for a major sporting, music and theatrical event above face value.  It will make it an offence to advertise a ticket at above face value.  <br\/><br\/>One thing I like about this Bill is its simplicity.  We will be making several changes on Committee Stage but it sends out a very simple message.  It will not work perfectly but it does not work perfectly anywhere in the world.  One of its powers, however, is its simplicity.  When it is signed into law, everyone in Ireland will know it is illegal to offer a ticket for sale above face value and to offer for sale on one's website other people's tickets above face value.  It will make it possible, not only for the police but for fans, to spot it and tackle it.  The Bill is about targeting organised ticket touting.  It has become particularly pervasive in recent years with the move to online sales.  Sophisticated touts are using so-called bots to buy up large numbers of tickets and to access tickets far more quickly than can any genuine fan.  Popular music and sporting events used to take days or hours to sell out and at that time, one could get a ticket if one was willing to queue.  I remember standing on Bray Main Street as a teenager at about 5 a.m. trying to get tickets to a U2 concert and we did.  At the end of the day the concert was sold out but if one was willing to get up at 4 a.m. and get into Bray and queue up all morning, one could get two tickets.  We got two tickets but that does not happen today.  Today they are sold out not in days or hours but in minutes or even seconds.  What drives genuine fans mad is that while they are pressing the button on the primary site trying to get tickets, they are told they will have to queue, that they have to wait and then that all the tickets have been sold out.  Moments later, however, the tickets appear on the secondary sites.  In some cases those secondary sites are owned by the primary seller but the tickets are no longer for sale at &euro;65.  They are suddenly &euro;100, &euro;200 or &euro;300.  We all know what is going on there.  It is organised, sophisticated ticket touts using modern technology to gouge fans.  It is only the touts who are profiting.  Some of these touts are just entrepreneurial types.  They saw a gap in the market and they are using technology to make a few quid.  Some of it is much more sinister.  A lot of evidence was given to a House of Commons committee on this issue last year.  One expert involved linked some of the organised ticket touting to organised crime.  Worryingly for us, the two areas he identified where those organised gangs are based are Israel and Dublin.  There is a highly sinister element to this.  Fans, sporting bodies and artists are being ripped off and it needs to stop.  This Bill is one important tool in bringing that about.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill protects charities and clubs.  It grants them exemptions when tickets are being sold for fundraising so they will still be able to auction off tickets at above face value for fundraising reasons.  The Bill allows people to sell their tickets at face value.  It allows resellers to do the same; it allows them to do so online and to continue to charge commission on the resale.  There is no problem with that.  It means that a margin can still be made by reselling sites if they are providing a service.  They are providing a way for fans to buy and sell tickets at face value.  They are providing verification that they are real tickets and they can charge a commission for it and maintain a margin.  This is important because there are a lot of reseller sites in Ireland that employ a lot of people.  We need to make sure that while we are protecting fans, we also make sure such jobs are secure.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill is a Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputy Rock and me.  As such, it is not legally rigorous, as is the case with all Private Members' Bills.  I acknowledge the work of the officials and the Minister, who have spent a great deal of time developing amendments for Committee Stage to tighten it up.  As Deputy Rock stated, some of the people who think they will lose out from this are already threatening constitutional and legal challenges.  We, as legislators, have to make sure it is tight before it is passed.  <br\/><br\/>Extensive consultation with stakeholders has taken place and has fed into the Committee Stage amendments.  The prohibition on above-cost resale will apply to designated venues with a capacity of over 1,000.  The amendment will outlaw the use of so-called bots used by these sophisticated touts, which is really important.  Interestingly, it will give UEFA confidence that only legitimate tickets will be sold onto the market for games in Ireland during Euro 2020, which is nice.  It is important.  Other sporting organisations have already taken steps.  As the Minister stated in her speech, the GAA has cancelled tickets for big games in the past when it has seen tickets appearing on secondary sites.  I will read part of the GAA's submission to the consultation on ticket touting because it really captures this issue.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>The current legislation in no way reflects the technological developments of recent decades.  It does not act as an incentive for the civil authorities to challenge the on-street touting at our fixtures or extortionate pricing on on-line sites.  Any change to the current legislation would help protect consumers, our members and the organisation.  Touting in its various forms should be classified as a criminal activity with appropriate penalties in place, whether this be on the street, on-line or private trading of tickets above face value or fraudulent tickets.<\/blockquote><p>We all have the height of respect for the GAA and the work it does.  They are its words on the actions that need to be taken.  My understanding is the FAI is supportive of this.  My understanding is the IRFU has indicated it is supportive.  We know artists are supportive, as the Minister stated.  We know promoters are supportive.  Where will the extra money go?  It will go to sports bodies and artists.  It will go where it should be going, to the people who create the value.  At least one other State agency is already acting.  Some time ago, when I started looking into this - I think it was about two years ago - I contacted the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and asked it if an investigation into secondary ticketing was warranted.  I told the commission it was something I would like to see, as I had seen disturbing trends in the market I thought might be anti-competitive.  I wrote to it and asked if it would consider launching an investigation to see if there was anti-competitive and, therefore, illegal behaviour at play.  I was delighted to hear back and subsequently met its representatives.  It has launched a belts-and-braces investigation.  It is looking at the potential abuse of a dominant market position, the illegal use of multiparty agreements and a range of other anti-competitive issues.  I am delighted to be able to say that I have an update from it on the investigation.  It has reviewed over 200,000 emails and has conducted 11 hearings.  I understand it will issue its findings later this year.  Without prejudice to what it finds, I am delighted the CCPC saw fit to take it so seriously and conduct such a comprehensive investigation.  We will see what it finds.  <br\/><br\/>This is not the most important issue facing us today.  While we all know that, it matters regularly to a great many music and sports fans, artists and sporting bodies.<\/p><p>Therefore, let us do it.  Let us stop people getting ripped off.  Let us take the gouging out of ticket touting.  When it comes to these types of touts, let us say, &quot;Thank you.  Next.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100034#LL00500","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548950400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Martin Kenny, who is sharing time with Deputy Quinlivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100036#NN00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1548950400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>We welcome anything that resolves this issue and makes progress as the Bill attempts to do.

Prior to that people had to go to the local shop that had the agency for supplying tickets.  They queued up there and bought them, as Deputy Donnelly mentioned earlier.  We have seen significant problems online, particularly for people living in rural areas with very bad broadband.  Sometimes my teenage children try to buy tickets online.

I genuinely believe they have an interest in solving the problem.  Unfortunately the Minister has left.  I will probably write to her or contact her to discuss the issue.  While we are discussing ticket touting again, we are no closer to solving the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The glacial pace the Government have moved on this issue is ridiculous, with consumers continuing to pay the price at the hands of ticket touts in the absence of any legislation.  As the Minister of State will be well aware, I introduced a Bill on this topic two years ago.  However, at every opportunity Fine Gael sought to delay the progress of that Bill, simply because it had a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy&rsquo;s name on it.<\/p>  <p>  First the Government, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced an amendment on Second Stage that delayed the Bill for nine months for no reason whatsoever.  Then the Government refused to issue a money message to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage, despite the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation carrying out detailed scrutiny on the Bill.  The committee&rsquo;s report recommended \"that ticket touting legislation is introduced immediately to ensure consumers are protected\".  The committee recognised that, \"if introduced, the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017 [the Bill I introduced] would help eliminate the problem of ticket touting in Ireland\".<\/p>  <p>  This behaviour by Fine Gael, of using the money message procedure to kill Opposition Bills such as this Bill and a number of others is a far cry from the new politics we were promised.  The new politics only seems to apply between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which is unsurprising considering the two parties are slowly merging into one.<\/p>  <p>  One could be forgiven for not realising the Government has actually been the biggest obstacle to eliminating ticket touting in recent years.  As Deputy Donnelly mentioned, Deputy Naughten introduced a Bill in 1998 and 21 years later we are still talking about it.<\/p>  <p>  This duplication of Bills on the same topic is not a valuable use of D&aacute;il time, especially considering we have only 21 D&aacute;il sitting days, including today, before Brexit on 29 March.  Although I fully appreciate the problem of ticket touting is very important and needs to be resolved as soon as possible, I think it would be more valuable to be debating today the emergency Brexit legislation that will be needed for businesses across Ireland, rather than going through the motions again with another Bill on ticket touting.<\/p>  <p>  It is peculiar that the Government is proceeding with a Bill that it admits is not currently fit for purpose and that needs substantial amendments.  Why did the Government simply not introduce a new Bill that would be ready to go?  We have not seen any of the amendments and have only read about them in press releases.  Will they change the substantive nature of the Bill, including importantly the size of venues that will be covered by it?  From what I have heard the Bill will no longer protect venues seating 300 or more, but only venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand new sections relating to bot software will be introduced on Committee or Report Stage.  I expect this will be a complex addition to the Bill and it would have been useful to see this in advance of tonight&rsquo;s debate.  If the Government is insistent on starting the whole process again and delaying the introduction of a prohibition on ticket touting, would it not be more prudent to introduce a Bill that is actually complete, which we can fully consider and debate thoroughly?<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s petty behaviour about Opposition Bills and subsequent delay in sorting this issue has resulted in thousands of consumers being ripped off by ticket touts in the past few years.  We have seen it again this week with different matches and concerts going on.<\/p>  <p>  Information I received indicates that 1,006 complaints have been lodged with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission since 2014 on the issue, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Many thousands of others have been ripped off, but made no complaints.<\/p>  <p>  I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  Under section 2(1), will an online site that hosts advertisements for tickets and other items for sale be liable for conviction under this legislation simply by hosting an advertisement with a ticket priced in excess of the designated price?  I am specifically talking about the offence in the section that refers to &ldquo;sell, or offer, or expose for sale&rdquo;.  If so how would this be enforced and, if not, does the Minster believe this section needs to be clarified?<\/p>  <p>  What would constitute a &ldquo;voluntary or community organisation&rdquo; as stated in section 2(3)?  How many organisations will this cover?<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand the rationale behind the increased capacity from 300 to 1,000.  Does this mean that tickets for events in smaller venues will not be protected by this legislation?  If so, this will exclude dozens of theatres and event venues around the country, including the National Opera House in Waterford with 855 seats, the Tivoli in Dublin with 560 seats, the Lime Tree in Limerick with 511 seats and the Abbey in Dublin with 494 seats.  I do not understand why the Government is now proposing a change to this Bill that would result in a large cohort of events excluded from the protections the legislation seeks to introduce.<\/p>  <p>  The Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017, which I introduced, includes a confiscation provision that would give the courts the power to recover profits they determine a convicted ticket tout may have gained from his or her illegal behaviour.  Was such a provision considered for this Bill?<\/p>  <p>  We understand there has been a strong lobby from secondary selling sites regarding legislating in this area.  We have all been lobbied on the matter.  I do not know whether what they claim is correct.  There have been some suggestions that jobs could be lost owing to the total ban on above-face-value sales of tickets.  Has the Minister examined this claim?  I ask her to clarify the role secondary selling sites have played in her preparation of this Bill.  What interactions has she had with these companies?<\/p>  <p>  I register my dissatisfaction with how the Government behaved regarding the Bill I introduced on this topic and many other Opposition Bills.  The use of the money message procedure to kill Opposition Bills is not in the public interest and this tactic should be stopped.<\/p>  <p>  However, Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the importance of solving the problem of ticket touting and we are therefore happy to facilitate this Bill moving to Committee Stage.  It is important to note that this is not an endorsement of the Bill because as I have pointed out, we have yet to see key aspects that apparently will form a large part of this Bill.  We look forward to seeing those amendments.  We may table amendments on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100036#NN00400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1548950400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The Labour Party wants to see the issue of ticket touting addressed.

When I came in here today I did not know whether the Bill would be introduced by the Minister or the two Deputies who sponsored it.  It is very unusual for a Private Members' Bill to be introduced in this way and I am absolutely certain it would not have happened if any other parties had been involved.  That is the point I am making in that regard.  We all have Bills that are awaiting money messages in various committees, an issue which must be addressed.  We have very limited time to debate anything as it stands and we may have to debate a Brexit Bill next month, although we hope that will not arise and we will not have a no-deal Brexit.  If that does happen, we will have all sorts of difficulties and will need a considerable amount of Oireachtas time to deal with it.<\/p><p>To address the Bill, I welcome the Minister's statement that this is not the complete object because some of the most important issues in this area are not currently covered in the legislation before us.  I refer in particular to the outlawing of bot software and am glad to hear the Minister intends to table an amendment dealing with that.  I assume the Deputies sponsoring the Bill would also be happy with that.  One of the biggest problems in this area is that tickets are bought up in bulk almost immediately, with the express intention of reselling them at a fairly significant profit.  I am not sure what the Minister's intentions are in regard to ensuring that a percentage of tickets for all events go on general sale.  I understand that for sporting events in particular, a certain number of tickets will be allocated to ten-year ticket holders, clubs and so on and that is perfectly acceptable.  However, some percentage of tickets should be set aside for sale to the general public.  We all know of people who go to every qualifying match in the GAA championship but who cannot get tickets for the final.  Deputies might say that they should be able to get them through their clubs but that is not always possible and genuine fans sometimes lose out.  Some percentage of tickets should be available to the general public.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to include such a provision in her amendments.  She said she is waiting for the advice of the Attorney General on whether the Bill will have to go to the EU for approval.  I also welcome Deputy Donnelly's statement that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is examining the Bill, which is very positive because we all want to see progress on this issue.  <\/p><p>I must be upfront and say that I am concerned about jobs in my constituency.  There are 275 workers currently employed by an IDA Ireland backed company in Limerick which provides customer services for the EU-wide, if not worldwide, activities of an online ticket resale platform.  I understand all of the points that have been made thus far.  I also note that Deputy Donnelly said that this Bill would secure jobs and that it will be possible to charge commission on resale.  However, I cannot find any provision in the Bill which states that one can charge commission on resale.  The legislation states that a service charge means &quot;any booking charge or fee imposed and printed on the ticket at the time of the initial sale by an authorised person&quot;.  I cannot see the provision to which Deputy Donnelly referred but perhaps the Minister can clarify that later.<\/p><p>There is a concern for the aforementioned jobs in Limerick.  The company in question was backed by IDA Ireland.  I attended the official opening a number of years ago, as did the relevant Minister.  We must be concerned about these 275 jobs, which is not a small number by any means.  I am not endorsing the resale of tickets at inflated prices, which is essentially what this Bill is trying to address, but recording my concern for those jobs.  The Minister must respond to this, given that she is also responsible for the IDA.  I am anxious, obviously, to protect jobs in my constituency.<\/p><p>I fully support the general purpose of this legislation.  I have been known to loiter outside Thomond Park on occasions when I did not have a ticket in the hope of meeting someone with one to spare but I would never pay more than face value.  I have also done it for GAA matches and most people who do it will never pay more than face value.  One will nearly always meet someone whose brother could not make it or some such and he or she will never ask for more than face value.  That is generally how sports fans behave.  I absolutely condemn those who hang around outside venues, pushing people out of the way so that they can sell tickets at inflated prices.  That is what we want to stamp out and I assume that is the aim of the two Deputies who sponsored this Bill.  It is what we all want to achieve.  <\/p><p>Deputy Rock said earlier that the Bill is fairly simple and straightforward but questions around legality arise.  One such question relates to the power of garda&iacute; to seize tickets.  The Bill reads thus: <\/p><blockquote>If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reasonable cause for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence under <i>section 2(1)<\/i>, that member may&mdash;(a) arrest without warrant the person who has so behaved<\/blockquote><p>The advice of the Attorney General may be required on that provision because I do not think garda&iacute; can arrest somebody on suspicion without warrant.  Certainly those who try to stop shoplifters are very much aware that if they accuse someone and then turn out to be wrong, they may be charged with taking someone's good name.  There may be pitfalls in this provision and if we are to pass legislation here, we must make sure it is tight and legally sound. <\/p><p>I presume that all of these issues will be discussed in depth on Committee Stage.  I am not a member of the relevant committee but I presume I can attend and contribute to the debate.  If I table amendments, I will not be able to vote on them but I presume I can attend the committee.  I look forward to seeing the Minister's amendments.  I assume she will publish them fairly soon.  Opposition spokespersons will need to see those amendments well in advance so that we can get legal advice on them and on what is a very important Bill which is genuinely trying to address a serious problem.  We need to get it right because otherwise it will be challenged and will not be effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100037#OO01000","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1548951000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>In response to what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan just said, there will always be occasions when people buy tickets and are not able to use them for whatever reason.

This becomes obvious when one compares the price of tickets in venues in Dublin with the prices in other European cities.

Respite care service provision has reached crisis point for over 100 families across counties Cavan and Monaghan who are on a waiting list for support.  Respite care services for children and adolescents with disabilities across counties Cavan and Monaghan have deteriorated significantly in recent months, with more families unable to access the services they so badly need.  Parents and carers are becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of respite care services, so much so that a parents action group has been set up to highlight the issues the families are facing.  The parents action group for respite care services held its first meeting in Cootehill, County Cavan before Christmas.  It was a robust, heated and highly charged meeting, as parents are at the end of their tether.<\/p>  <p>  I have been raising this issue on the floor of the House for months in an effort to relieve the plight of these parents and ensure proper, consistent supportive services will be put in place.  On 4 January the parents took to the streets in a demonstration to convey their anger at the lack of respite care services.  They protested outside the entrance to St. Davnet's in Monaghan to highlight their concerns.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that they are the parents of children with disabilities, physical and intellectual, who face huge challenges every day of their lives.  They should not have to resort to protesting on the streets outside a hospital, but they felt it was necessary to have their voices heard and have the HSE take this matter as seriously as it is for them.<\/p>  <p>  The only facility currently available to parents who need respite care for their children is Annalee respite care centre in Cootehill.  The centre has five beds, but no places have been available since mid-September.  I understand beds recently became available, but there was a crisis up until that point.  I commend the hard work of the chairperson of the parents action group, Jennie Farrelly, who, with a delegation which comprised Niamh Brannigan, Kate McCabe, Seamus Cahill and my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, recently met the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to raise their concerns.  I take my hat off to these parents who not only take the time to hold public meetings and protest but also to come to Dublin to meet the Minister of State.  <\/p>  <p>  I am not exaggerating when I say services in this area are in crisis.  Listening is not enough.  The parents need action.  They need another centre dedicated to children who need respite care services.  They face enough challenges in life without having the lifeline of respite care withdrawn from them and being left for months without a break.  It is utterly disgraceful that they have been abandoned in a vacuum with no end in sight.  The obvious response of the HSE in the midst of the crisis was to find alternative accommodation or offer increased home care support hours to the families, but it did nothing.  It is my understanding the service has resumed since 11 January, but I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to outline what plan is in place to deal with the backlog which has built up in the past five months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100038#PP00700","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1548951600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath.  As my version of the response does not reference specifically counties Cavan and Monaghan, if the Deputy needs me to obtain specific information, I will.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.  Respite care services are an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families.  Short breaks can also provide an opportunity for individuals to meet new people, widen their social circle and gain new experiences.  Respite care is crucial in helping to reduce family stress, preserve the family unit and provide stability.  The need for increased respite care services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  As part of its ongoing service provision, this year the HSE will provide over 182,500 respite care nights and 32,662 day respite care sessions for families in need across the country.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 there was a significant improvement in respite care provision.  An additional &euro;10 million was provided to fund 12 new respite care houses, one in each HSE CHO area, plus an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite care in this area.  The additional houses are providing additional respite care for families who need it.  To date, ten houses have opened and the remaining two are scheduled to open shortly.  When fully operational, they will provide for 19,000 extra over-night stays and 2,520 home sharing night stays annually.  Some &euro;2 million of the additional money is being targeted at alternative respite care services.  These are practical and important solutions, with alternative respite care provision working well locally, with good examples of summer camps, evening and Saturday clubs, benefiting hundreds of adults and children.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 community-based, alternative respite care projects delivered 15,144 in-home respite care hours to 400 users and 1,296 Saturday evening-holiday club sessions to 1,500 people.  The number of adult service users continually increases as service users transfer from child to adult services.  This impacts on the level of respite care existing service users receive.  In addition, a number of service users have associated mobility needs, which means that they can only access downstairs bedrooms.  This also affects the level of respite care they receive.  In preparing its 2019 national service plan additional finding will be focused by the HSE on a number of priority areas arising from ongoing demographic changes.  They include the expansion of community disability services to meet the needs of school leavers; 100 new therapy posts to address assessment of need waiting lists for children with disabilities; personal assistance and home support service hours, residential places and respite care places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100038#PP00800","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1548951600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Minister of State is not the Minister with responsibility for disabilities or health, but I thank him for coming to the House to address the issue.

My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, has also raised it on a number of occasions.  There are parents in the region who have had no access to respite care services for five months.<\/p><p>I am aware the parents action group met officials from the HSE this morning.  I am not exaggerating when I speak about the frustration and the significant number of families - more than 100 - who have been affected by this and when I say the parents are at the end of their tether.  One family who came to me have a daughter who has a severe physical and intellectual disability.  She is almost ten years of age and they have never been offered respite care.  They are on a waiting list but these lists are so long.  The one facility available is taken up because there is a child who has difficulties and needs to be housed on their own for whatever reason.  There is no other facility to accommodate the parents and children who are on a waiting list.<\/p> <p> We cannot carry on like this.  These people are the most vulnerable in society.  These are parents are exasperated and exhausted and are losing faith in the system, which they should be able to rely on for some support.

I realise it is not the Department of the Minister of State present.  I will give an example of how this issue came to a head.  A 93 year old constituent of mine was in hospital after a recent illness and the social worker said that 21 hours of home care would be awarded to this family.  The difficulty is that the family has been told there is no funding available for the 21 hours.  I put questions down to the Minister and he said it was a matter for the HSE but the HSE is not in a position to give the information on these 21 hours.  I realise this is an issue affecting people throughout the State.  Some counties have been left behind.  There are nearly 700 people waiting in Galway, 600 in north Dublin, 578 in Wexford, and 200 in Dublin South-West.  They are all impacted by this.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis this family is facing is that the mother was getting very distressed where she was and they took her home.  She is getting 24-hour care now.  One can realise this cost of this by a simple calculation in one's head.  It could be anyone's relation.  This is just one example.  Unfortunately for the family, they have taken on this burden.  Surely if it is indicated that there are hours available, the family should get some support.  Unfortunately, up to now, that has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that this is not the responsibility of the Minister of State present but there is the notion of collective responsibility.  I ask the Minister of State to go to the Minister of State in charge to try to find out when this funding may become available.  The Minister of State may recall that during the week I asked the Taoiseach about this particular area.  Nobody at Cabinet level seems to be able to answer the question on these hours.  The Taoiseach stated that the budget had been increased for next year which is great.  When will this be seen on the ground and, in particular, in these people's homes?<\/p>  <p>  It does not make economic sense to leave people in respite care beds if the family wants to take them home.  It is distressing for the patients themselves.  It also probably puts the patient at risk from infections and so on that can be picked up in hospitals, unfortunately.  This woman, and perhaps many other people who are elderly, want to spend their remaining time in their home.  That is where their happy memories are.  They do not want to be in a bed in a ward with strangers even though they are being well looked after.  At the end of the day, this woman wants to be at home with those who love her around her.  She has good neighbours as well.  Surely we should be able to come up with some sort of package or supports to help people remain in their home.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how the Minister of State feels about this but I feel sick to my stomach that someone is left in this situation where the family are left helpless.  This woman is on oxygen and she is blind but her brain is absolutely perfect and she knows exactly what is going on.  She knows her own mind and wants to stay in her own home.  This is not a Third World country.  With all the wealth that is floating round and the money we can spend and misuse on different things, surely we can come up with some sort of supports for families like this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100039#QQ00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1548952200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Crowe.  I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  In the case outlined by the Deputy, where 21 hours of home help is required, one could not but wish to see a person of that age and who still has her faculties in her family home situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's core stated objective is to promote care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  A wide range of services are provided, including home supports, day care and residential care, through direct service provision and through voluntary and private providers.  Respite care is an essential component to ensuring older people with care needs in the home, including those with dementia, can be cared for in their community and close to their carers.  The service offers additional assistance to families and carers, thus helping to alleviate the ongoing stress associated with providing care.  Respite can often assist with avoidable acute hospital admissions.  Respite is provided in several different ways and settings across the health system.  It is provided through designated respite beds in public residential centres and contracted by the HSE in private nursing homes &ndash; where it is used to increase the availability of such beds to meet demand &ndash; within the resources available in the local area. <\/p>  <p>  There are over 1,800 short stay beds in public long stay units.  These may be used interchangeably for respite, rehabilitation, convalescence or other uses, depending on current demand in the centres.  Therefore, the number of respite beds in any one month can fluctuate up and down depending on demand for that bed.<\/p>  <p>  Planned respite can be provided, allowing carers to have planned breaks throughout the year.  Respite may be provided as part of an enhanced home support package, where the funding can be used to procure a period of respite.  Respite can also be provided on an emergency basis for unforeseen circumstances, for example, due to bereavement or illness of carers, or emergency environmental changes to the residence of the client.  The provision of respite beds is part of an integrated model of care and the HSE strongly advocates and supports the system of respite care nationally.  The HSE is currently considering the role of the respite services and how these can contribute to the provision of a streamlined pathway of care for older persons.  Respite services are also an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families.  Short breaks can also provide an opportunity for individuals to meet and engage with other people socially.  This year, the HSE will provide over 182,500 respite nights and 32,500 day respite sessions.<\/p><p>Home care is an increasingly important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals.  Last year, a single funding stream for home support services brought together the funding for home help and standard home care packages which now operate as a single home support service.  In excess of 53,000 people will receive more than 18 million home support hours this year.  This will assist older people to live independently in their homes and enable large numbers of people to return home following acute hospital admission.<\/p> <p> Despite this significant level of service provision, demand continues to rise and there is considerable variation in access to services in different parts of the country.  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  That is why we propose to establish a statutory scheme for home support services which will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100039#QQ00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548952800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>While I understand the Minister of State is reading a script, on a personal note, what does he say to families who are left in this situation and who are clearly facing a crisis?  I do not know of any family who would be able to pay &euro;20 an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a package that, in this case, would allow a woman to stay in her home.  A huge burden is being put on such families and we are a bit light in our response to those in that situation.  Can anything be done?  Will additional funding be made available to community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7, the area where this woman is located?  If it will, when will it be released?<\/p>  <p>  During the week, the Taoiseach said additional funding was coming down the line.  While that would be one way to help, we need to look at the bigger picture if we are serious about our ageing population and about supporting those who will clearly have support needs.  If our overall policy is to try to keep people in their homes for as long as possible, we need supports.  This family are in crisis and there are no real answers for them here today.  I am awaiting a reply from the Minister but I know he will kick it back to the HSE, which does not have the answers.<\/p>  <p>  It sounds like a whinge but I do not know where to go with this.  The family have come to me thinking I have the answers.  I am coming here today asking the Minister of State whether he has the answers, but it is clear that, collectively, we do not.  I am sure the Minister of State will go back to the Minister.  We need an answer specifically in regard to those who are getting on in age but who are distressed by the idea of having to stay in hospital.  Even where there is a loving family who want to take such people home, they need some sort of support.  If we can do that and come up with some sort of solution for families like this, it will be a good day's work for us.  While I am concentrating on one family, I realise there are probably thousands of families in the same situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100040#RR00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1548952800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>There are certainly many families in this situation.

In this whole area of home care and home support, given the fact many more people are seeking it and, with the demographics, we know many more will be seeking it, it makes sense to have a statutory scheme.  On the bigger picture, I will ask the Minister specifically when he thinks those measures for that scheme will be announced.  I will also ask him in regard to CHO 7 and the case raised by the Deputy.  I know the Deputy is awaiting a response from the Minister and perhaps something can be done in that case.

On Tuesday morning I put down a Topical Issue matter on this issue but it was not accepted for debate, so I raised it on the Order of Business on Tuesday.  The Minister said he had been alerted that the cold weather initiative, which is ongoing since November, had been activated and was upping its game.  I was told there were beds in the system and that the outreach teams were sufficiently filled and would be going out in the following days.  Yesterday, information started filtering through from the inner city homeless and housing group that they had been out on Tuesday night and had met 86 people who were sleeping rough.  One of the team leaders rang for beds on four occasions but no beds were available.  They called on their phone and can prove that happened.  In that case, people who wanted emergency beds did not get them.  The group were out again last night and were in contact with 98 people sleeping rough.  Six of these people were in Store Street Garda station, four of whom got beds, although the others did not want to go in.  We know there are many reasons people do not want to go in, given the conditions they face.<\/p>  <p>  The All Together Now homeless outreach team met a man on Tuesday night who was hungry and freezing, so they gave him food, gloves, a hat and a thermal foil blanket.  He had spent the whole of Monday day, Monday night and Tuesday out on the street.  The team rang Housing First but no bed was available on Tuesday night.  He was directed to the freefone but he had no mobile phone and there are only six public phones operating in the inner city at the moment.  Here was a man who was literally told to go away and come in at 10.30, which is what he had to do.  The inner city homeless group has said that, last night, one man they were dealing with did not want to go anywhere and he was suicidal.  He had been beaten up, so they called an ambulance for him and he was brought to hospital.<\/p>  <p>  This is happening on the streets.  Fr. Peter McVerry was on radio today to tell a similar story of a man who knocked on his door.  When he rang the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, it said he would have to go to the Garda station because it was his first time putting himself forward for emergency accommodation.  The man had no identification and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive said the protocol was that he could come down and get a sleeping bag but it could not take him in.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a serious spell of cold weather this week.  It is irresponsible not to take in somebody who is seeking emergency accommodation.  Will the Minister of State clarify how many beds are vacant in the system?  I know 320 single beds were set up late last year and we have been told there are vacant beds in the system.  Considering what happened over recent nights, particularly Tuesday night, when we were told there were no beds in the system, I would like the Minister of State to respond.  This is very serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100040#RR00400","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1548952800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The Government is fully committed to resolving homelessness.  It is an absolute priority for the Department to deliver solutions to provide solutions for all of the individuals and families who do not have a home.  In Dublin, where rough sleeping presents the biggest challenge, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, co-ordinates the delivery of homeless services across the four local authorities.  The DRHE constantly evaluates the requirement for accommodation and engages with the Department regularly on the delivery of accommodation solutions.<\/p><p>In September 2018, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, requested that the DRHE co-ordinate a plan for the delivery of additional beds across the Dublin region in order to ensure that accommodation is available for those at risk of rough sleeping.  Since then, the DRHE has delivered 200 permanent beds and has also put in place approximately 150 temporary beds for the cold weather period.  The Department has been assured by the DRHE that the accommodation arrangements that have been put in place have ensured that there is adequate capacity to cater for all who wish to obtain shelter.  The management of the booking of beds is co-ordinated by the DRHE through a central placement service.  The DRHE has confirmed that since the introduction of the new beds, there has been sufficient capacity in the system to ensure that a bed is available for anyone who wishes to avail of it.  That was indeed the case on Tuesday night.<\/p> <p> The DRHE is working to deal with a very challenging situation, in conjunction with its NGO service delivery partners.  There continue to be challenges in encouraging some individuals who are rough sleeping to come into shelter.  What the Deputy said is correct.  There is a man sleeping rough close to where I live on the edge of Waterford city who has been offered help by State agencies as well as individuals and I have learned today that he seems to have taken a bed some place, thanks be to God.<\/p> <p> The DRHE has outreach teams that work on the streets 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, engaging with people sleeping rough.  The current cold weather strategy provides a targeted response to people sleeping rough, especially those that are reluctant to engage with services or those that are long-term sleeping rough.  The DRHE has confirmed that sufficient capacity exists to provide shelter for all those who require it and will continue to provide outreach and support for those unwilling to engage with services.<\/p> <p> With regard to the statements made by Inner City Helping Homeless that there was insufficient bed capacity on Tuesday night, the director of the DRHE was very clear in her media statements yesterday that those assertions were incorrect.  Deputies should exercise caution in making statements to the D&aacute;il on the basis of statements by individual organisations.  To do so risks undermining the work of the DRHE and all of the service delivery partners involved in outreach work and the provision of emergency accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100040#RR00500","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548953400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>If the 158 rough sleepers said tonight that they need emergency beds, is there capacity in the system to provide them?  That is a simple question.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State commented on the claims by the Inner City Helping Homeless group.  Its lead team made contact by phone on four separate occasions and was told no bed was available.  It is not right to dismiss the claims of such a group that is out on the streets every single night.  It can get the recording of the telephone calls, during which it was explicitly stated that there were no beds were available.  If that was the case - I think it was because I know a woman who is involved and I do not think she would say it otherwise - then there is a problem and we must find out what happened and try to address the issue.  One of the reasons I wanted to raise the matter today is that if there is a fault in the system we must be big enough to be prepared to find out what went wrong and to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  The situation involving Peter McVerry is horrendous.  The man walked off and Peter McVerry tried to ring him back but he must have noted an incorrect digit when taking down the phone number because there was no reply.  In severe cold weather conditions such as those being experienced at the moment, hostels should be open all day.  People have to leave approximately 150 beds at 8 a.m. and come back at 9 p.m.  In severe weather conditions such as we have now, however, they should be open for 24 hours a day and at weekends in order to respond to the situation.  There should also be an access point in the city centre where people can go to try to get accommodation rather than having to use phones.  There are only six telephone boxes in the inner city area.  We must address such issues.  We should make every effort to get the responders and outreach teams to try to convince as many people as possible to come in because the conditions are serious and people could die as a result.  The State must up its game in terms of the services provided for rough sleepers in order that people will not be fearful going into hostels when they need to access them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100041#SS00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1548953400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Deputy Joan Collins is correct in what she stated regarding the current weather conditions.

I am told by the Department that there is capacity in the system to provide beds tonight for the rough sleepers in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the four telephone calls, I accept the Deputy's point that there may be faults in the system.  I have no problem trying to get to the bottom of that but the capacity is in the system and the DRHE has done good work in the past 12 months, and prior to that, to ensure that the number of rough sleepers has dropped dramatically in the four Dublin local authorities, but that is no consolation to the 158 people Deputy Joan Collins mentioned earlier.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Government provided &euro;60 million in capital funding to local authorities and other agencies for the delivery of emergency accommodation for individuals and families experiencing homelessness.

T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och don Cheann Comhairle gur roghnaigh s&eacute; an t-&aacute;bhar seo.  Late last year a number of payments to substitute teachers were stopped by the Department of Education and Skills's payroll section and that resulted in them being overtaxed on recent payments.  It seems the Department of Education and Skills failed to register substitute teachers and some special needs assistants for a new PAYE system, meaning that they were treated as new employees and have had emergency tax deducted from their fortnightly payslip.  The issue affects a number of teachers and has had a significant effect on their take-home pay.  Some teachers have been taxed more than &euro;500 for eight days work.  Some substitute teachers who were not paid before Christmas for one week between 17 December and 21 December were not paid until last week.  Many received no warning that they would be missing a whole week's pay prior to Christmas and that was deeply distressing for them.<\/p>  <p>  When my office contacted the Department of Education and Skills about the issue before Christmas, we were assured that it would be addressed directly after Christmas and we were told that the fault lay not with the Department or the Revenue but with boards of management.  One suggested option was to advise teachers to simply go to the board of management and to ask for a sub, as one would call it, on their wages.<\/p>  <p>  This week, some teachers have been faced with a major tax bill and some got a double whammy.  I was informed that the schools were at fault but it seems clear now that the Department is responsible, which was denied prior to Christmas.  Could the Minister confirm that the cause of this issue has been identified?  I accept that PAYE modernisation is complicated and the Department of Education and Skills is not the only organisation experiencing these issues.  On the whole, however, people have not been affected by it and the question that arises is why this cohort is being so badly impacted.  The teachers being impacted by the failures are some of the most vulnerable and they cannot afford to take the hit.  The issue requires absolute priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister addressed the issue of substitute teachers last weekend but I am not sure what he or the Department has done about it.  There are too many vacancies and too much demand for substitute teachers in the system.  We cannot get substitute teachers and that is a bigger problem.<\/p><p>The individual problems for these teachers are absolutely devastating.  Many of them are substitute teachers because for some bizarre reason they cannot get permanent jobs at second level.  At primary level we do not have enough teachers to fill the gaps and substitute teachers are brought in.  For all the substitute teachers that have been devastated by this, there are many more gaps where positions have not been filled either permanently or by substitutes.  One constituent of mine has been out of her primary teacher job because she is very seriously ill.  She is going back before she is better because she feels so bad.  A special needs teacher was taken out of special needs education within the school to cover her class.  There is a huge feeling of guilt among teachers because this is necessitated by somebody's serious illness.  Can the Minister outline exactly how the tax and pay situation came about for these substitute teachers?  When can the teachers expect a repayment of the emergency tax that was taken from their pay last week?  Is the Minister confident that these issues, which have plagued the system, have been resolved?  If not, can he provide details of any further issues identified so that teachers will not be left in the lurch and will know what is happening?  This has now happened in the Minister's Department.  Similar issues with changes in IT and new systems happened in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  A cohort of people out there are badly affected.  Some feel this is a small cohort of people and it does not really matter.  It matters a lot to them.  It adds to the perception that teachers are not valued by the system.  They are not valued by the bureaucracy which funds the education system.  It is deeply damaging to teaching morale when teachers see these stories in the paper.  Moreover, it is deeply damaging to the prospects of recruiting more teachers.  Every time I get the opportunity I appeal to people to consider teaching as a profession, notwithstanding all these difficulties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100041#SS00500","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548954000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta f&aacute; choinne an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute;.

A large cohort of people has been affected.  I would like to give some background, as the Deputy asked for, and then I will outline to the House what we are doing to rectify this situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners introduced pay as you earn, PAYE, modernisation systems from 1 January 2019.  PAYE modernisation involves the most significant reform of the PAYE system since its introduction in 1960.  From 1 January 2019 employers are required to report their employees&rsquo; pay and statutory deductions to Revenue for each payroll issue.  The new real-time reporting regime is operational for all employee payments made from 1 January 2019.  Employers, agents and payroll providers have to have new business processes and practices in place to meet the new requirements.  This involved major changes to most payroll systems in the country.  The aims of PAYE modernisation are to improve the streamlining of business processes and to reduce the administrative burden previously experienced by employers in meeting their PAYE reporting obligations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department issues 120,000 payments per fortnight to teachers, non-teaching staff, retired staff and casual and non-casual substitute staff.  The serving staff are employed by the managerial authorities of schools and their salaries are paid by my Department on behalf of the managerial authorities.  The salary issue that has arisen and has been referred to relates to the taxation of the substitute staff.  It is confined to substitute staff who were paid in the first payroll of 2019 and in the case of post-primary substitute teachers in the second payroll also.  The first payrolls of 2019 were on 3 January 2019 for post-primary teachers and on 10 January for primary teachers, non-teaching staff and retirees.  The second payroll for post-primary staff was on 17 January.<\/p>  <p>  The claims for the payment of substitute staff are submitted by the managerial authorities of schools using an automated system referred to as the on-line claim system, OLCS.  The records of employment are submitted through the OLCS for casual and non-casual substitute staff.  The details of each period of employment transfer to the Department where the appropriate rates of pay are applied, statutory deductions are calculated and the payment issues in the regular payroll run for the sector.  The OLCS ensures that service history for casual and non-casual substitute staff is accurately recorded regardless of the number of schools a person may teach in and ensures accurate service history and accurate incremental progression.<\/p>  <p>  In the first payrolls of the new year, in which the new system was applied for the first time, the payroll files that transferred to Revenue inadvertently included an end date for casual and non-casual substitute staff which informed Revenue that these staff would not be paid under this employer number in the future.  This notification immediately caused Revenue to reduce the tax credits and cut-off points to zero for this cohort of staff.  This meant that when they were next paid there were no tax credits available to be applied to the salary if they were paid on our payrolls in the next payroll issue.  When Revenue is notified by an employer that an employment has ceased, the credits at that employment are available for reallocation to an existing employment or to a new employment.  This has affected the substitute staff paid in the payrolls I mentioned, a group which represents 8% of payees on the payrolls.  This has meant that substitute staff who were paid on the payrolls of 3 January, 10 January and 17 January and who have continued to be employed since are being taxed at a very high rate.  Substitutes employed or paid after these dates for the first time in the 2019 tax year are not be affected by the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The payroll software has been amended to prevent an end date transferring to Revenue for future payments.  This means that casual and non-casual substitute staff being paid for the first time in the 2019 tax year since the payroll of the 17 January will not have problems with tax credits.  However, this software amendment did not correct the issues that arose for the substitute staff paid in the first payrolls of the year.  That is the issue that has been raised tonight.  Within my Department the highest priority is being accorded to addressing the problem for the substitute staff affected and to ensuring that the correct tax credits apply and that refunds of tax that have been deducted in error will issue to the people in question.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the PAYE modernisation systems by Revenue means the resolution of the issue is not completely within the control of the Department of Education and Skills.  It requires collaboration with the Revenue Commissioners to address the issue and reach a technical solution.  My Department is actively working with the Revenue Commissioners to bring about a resolution.  I have just left a meeting on this very issue and I wish to let Deputy Byrne and the House know that we are using all our efforts and capacity to find a solution for this.  A technical solution is needed, but this requires effort at a human level as well.  I am conscious that there are teachers out there who have faced deductions and are facing pressure with the everyday realities of living, having expected a certain amount and then not received it.  I wish to give an assurance that when this is rectified, the deductions that were made will be reimbursed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100042#TT00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1548954000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; seo i bhfad n&iacute;os measa n&aacute; a cheapamar.

It is not good enough for the Minister to come into the D&aacute;il and say he is using all his efforts to find a solution.  The Minister is the employer: he is required by law to pay the wages of his staff.  I strongly suggest that a manual process is applied, with all hands on deck to make sure that the cheques are written.  It is simply not good enough to tell teachers to wait for Revenue to refund their tax.  They are PAYE staff.  They are not responsible for making returns to Revenue.  Not once but twice the Minister has admitted on the floor of the D&aacute;il that this is the Department's fault and we still do not have a solution to this problem.  The only news the Minister has given me tonight is that he is using all his efforts to find a solution.  I suggest the solution is to write cheques from the Department and then sort it out between the Department and Revenue separately.<\/p><p>That is the only way this will be solved.

My assurance to the people who have had wrong amounts deducted from their wages is that the deductions will be paid back to them in full.  I have impressed on all my officials, and I have just come from a meeting, the need to ensure we get a solution.  I share the Deputy's concern on a number of fronts where people have to pay their day-to-day bills, mortgages or rent.  The reality of living costs is foremost in my mind.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be clear that the software used did not take into account substitute teachers.  That issue has been rectified but the difficulty is that it has not been rectified for those three payments affecting two cycles for substitute teachers and one cycle for primary substitute teachers.

Every day, people with mental health difficulties face discrimination in accessing services, accommodation or getting jobs.  This Bill is aimed at ending that mental health discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone can experience a mental health problem.  One in four of us will.  We have come a long way in destigmatising mental health.  However, while stigma has been weakened, it still exists in respect of mental health in Ireland.  There is still a fear that people will treat one differently if one is open about suffering a mental health issue.  There are still those who wrongly believe that people with mental health problems should not do important jobs.  There is still a persistent and incorrect perception among a minority that the outlook for recovery is poor.  That is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill amends Irish equality legislation, including employment legislation, by creating a stand-alone ground for mental health within our equality legislation in order to strengthen, clarify and expand it by giving it a more human rights based definition.  It contains a more broad definition of mental health status and includes a person&rsquo;s emotional, psychological and social well-being.  By creating a stand-alone ground it also puts mental health discrimination front and centre within our equality legislation.  Currently, under equality and employment legislation, it is unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of disability, and that includes a mental illness.  However, the disability ground restricts mental health to a narrow medical definition and it is hidden away under the disability ground.  This ground of disability is retained.<\/p>  <p>  So why do this?  Since the original Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act were passed, our understanding of mental health has developed significantly.  In the past 20 years we have grown to understand that mental health is not just the absence of disease or illness.  It is a complex combination of a person&rsquo;s physical, mental, emotional and social health factors.  However, people with mental health difficulties continue to face discrimination in housing, employment and State services, especially indirect discrimination.  That can lead to isolation, which exacerbates mental illness, and they become trapped in a cycle of illness by discrimination and stigma.<\/p>  <p>  Since being elected a Deputy and appointed mental health spokesperson I have met many people who have suffered discrimination based on their mental health status.  I am often told that the fear of prejudice and discrimination holds them back from seeking help.  In 2010, a study entitled Hear My Voice: Challenging Mental Health Prejudice and Discrimination, by Dublin City University&rsquo;s school of nursing, on behalf of Amnesty International Ireland, showed that as many as 95% of Irish people who have mental health issues say they have been treated unfairly because of their condition.  Almost two thirds of the 300 study participants interviewed reported having been avoided or shunned because of a mental health problem.  As many as 61% of individuals said they had been treated unfairly by family members while 43% claimed to have faced discrimination when it came to retaining a job.  One third experienced difficulties when applying for work with the result that two thirds had decided not to seek some roles.  Survey participants also reported unfair treatment in areas such as education.  It must be remembered that this study was carried out some ten years after discrimination based on mental illness was made illegal.<\/p>  <p>  Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International was reported as saying at the time that while there is no clear evidence of overt direct discrimination by the State against people with mental health problems in national laws, policies or practices, the real issue was the hidden indirect discrimination that people with mental health problems face when they experience inequality in education, housing, work and other areas.  Mr. O'Gorman added: \"We know that people with mental health problems have lower employment rates and are more likely to have left education early, suggesting the reported unfair treatment from the research is having a very real impact on people&rsquo;s lives.\"<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Government is opposing the Bill.  It appears it is doing so on the grounds that it might expose employers to legal action or is difficult to enforce.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to strengthen equality legislation to act as a preventive measure and any employer who complied with the equality legislation would have nothing to fear.  If those arguments were accepted as an excuse we would have no equality legislation.  Most LGBT discrimination has been and is of an insidious nature and is often difficult to prove.  Similarly regarding discrimination based on gender, but we do not say that because it is difficult to prove we tolerate it.  The opposite is the case.  It is the most insidious and indirect discrimination that we must guard against.  It is precisely because it is a wrong and that it is hard to prove that we must take a legislative stand against it.  We must make it clear, in black and white, that discrimination of any kind is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the difficulty of enforcement, I would point out that the Domestic Violence Act 2018, a very welcome and important Act, a criminal code, includes under section 5(o) the grounds of psychological and emotional welfare of a victim.  Those terms, therefore, are already a part of Irish law and will need to be interpreted by the courts.  It is difficult to understand the Government's objection to the use of the terminology in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed with the Government&rsquo;s decision to try to block legislation that will strengthen anti-discrimination laws.  If this was really about enforcement, any real concerns could be teased out on Committee Stage.  Instead, just like the mental health parity legislation, which the Government killed with a money message, it appears the Government is so embarrassed by its own failure to legislate on mental health that it is taking a knee-jerk reaction to any opposition efforts to do so.<\/p>  <p>   It is now over three years since the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 reported.  It made 165 recommendations.  We have had three Ministers with responsibility for mental health in that time but, to date, the Government has legislated for only one of those recommendations.  Despite many promises, we have not even seen a heads of Bill yet.  I appreciate that does not come under the Minister of State's remit but it does come under the Government's general remit and that of the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the rest of the House will support this Bill going to committee where it can be further scrutinised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100043#UU00500","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1548954600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time and for bringing forward the Bill.  It has been a good day in the House where we had a lot of discussion, first, with statements on CAMHS earlier and now this Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is bringing forward this Bill to end discrimination against those who suffer with mental health issues.  The Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill will amend Irish equality legislation to ensure that persons can no longer be discriminated against on the basis of a mental health issue.<\/p>  <p>  Our Bill introduces a stand-alone mental health ground of discrimination.  This ground contains a broad definition of mental health status and includes persons' emotional, psychological and social well-being.  Currently, it is unlawful to discriminate if a person has a disability, and that includes mental illness.  However, the ground restricts mental health to a narrow medical definition.  Our Bill puts mental health discrimination front and centre with equality legislation.  It puts mental health as a stand-alone ground and gives it a human rights based definition.<\/p>  <p>  It is crucial that every person is treated with dignity, fairness and respect, regardless of his or her mental health status.  The Bill will serve as a further step towards bringing Ireland in line with international standards and equality and understanding of mental health as a human rights issue and not just a medical issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill seeks to amend the Employment Act 1998 and the Equal Status of 2000 to expand the definition of mental health.  In 1998 and in 2000, respectively, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.  Disability is one of the nine grounds of discrimination set out in the Acts.<\/p><p>While the definition of disability in the Bill includes mental illness, the definition within the Acts provides a restrictive medical definition of mental health.  Attitudes, stereotypes and prejudices about mental health can lead to discrimination.  People regularly tell us that they have been discriminated against because of their mental health status.  These are people who find themselves treated less favourably than someone else solely because of their mental health status.  For this reason, Fianna F&aacute;il has brought forward this Bill with a broadened definition of mental health to prevent discrimination on mental health grounds on a human rights basis.<\/p> <p> We are at a stage where we have openness and honesty and when asked if they have medical conditions, people are finding it is okay to say they are not okay and to be honest with their employer.  They have come through the time when we did not talk about mental health issues.  The reason the Bill is before us is that people are dealing with and talking about their issues.  It is important for employees with mental health issues to feel they will be treated equally and not differently from someone with a disability.<\/p> <p> The Bill aims to solve three problems.  First, it will help employees who have had a mental health issue.  It does so by tackling one of the obstacles facing those who suffer from a mental health issue in their employment, namely, discrimination.  If enacted, it will be crystal clear for employers and employees alike that discrimination based on mental health status is against the law.  Second, it will address the need to prohibit any attempt to limit services based on a person's mental health status.  The legislation will make it illegal to limit the provision of services based on a person's mental health status.  Discrimination on the grounds of mental health status violates the very principle of equality for which we all seek to strive.  Third, the Bill promotes equality by seeking to protect those who have been subjected to discrimination.  It is crucial that every person is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of his or her mental health status.  This Bill will serve as a further step towards bringing Ireland in line with international standards on equality and understanding on mental health as well as human rights.  It is not just a mental health issue.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State and the Government to reconsider and allow this legislation to proceed to Committee Stage.  It warrants that very basic support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100043#UU00600","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548955200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>With the agreement of the House, we will hear Deputy Buckley's contribution and then have the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100044#VV00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1548955200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies O'Loughlin, O'Callaghan and Browne for bringing this important Bill to the House.  This is in keeping with the recent trend of raising awareness in the House of mental health issues and their equal place alongside physical health issues.  Just as everyone will experience varying levels of physical health in the course of life, we all struggle daily to maintain and preserve our good mental health.  That struggle is all the more difficult when it is done in silence.  We know this when it comes to physical health all too well.  For decades, public health measures have promoted the idea that looking after one's health is something on which people should take the initiative by discussing issues with friends, family and, above all, professionals to ensure appropriate action is taken when necessary.  Awareness of our personal physical health on a daily basis has never been better.  This is the model we must adopt for mental health and much effort has been made in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  We have had successful and positive public health campaigns on mental health issues.  Campaigns promoted reaching out, talking to someone one trusts and checking up on friends and family.  We have heard the slogan, \"It is okay not to be okay\", but is that the case?  While the meaning of that statement is good and right and based on ideals we must pursue, the truth is our laws do not reflect this approach.  As far as an employer is concerned, the law says it is not okay not to be okay but it is okay to discriminate against those with mental health issues.  This in turn tells people who may need help to stay quiet because it is not okay and they may be worse off if they take action.  By making it a violation of employment equality legislation to discriminate against people on the basis of their mental health status, we affirm the anti-stigma slogan.  We say not only that it is okay not to be okay, but it is okay and right to speak up and seek help.<\/p>  <p>  This House has rightly spoken out against discrimination on grounds of physical impairment.  I do not see any difference with this measure, which does more than close a gap in legislation, as some may hope.  It addresses a real need because this kind of discrimination is happening in private and public employment.  It is happening to people who have sought help and those who have not sought help.  It is even happening to people who do not need help but about whom suspicions have arisen regarding their mental health as a result of a climate of stigma which persists, even if it has diminished.  I have spoken to many people with stories of this kind of discrimination, which has created fear, damaged their health and may result in them seeking care.  This is unacceptable and must be made a thing of the past.  Who knows how many others stayed silent, hurting themselves and not seeking help for fear of being stigmatised or discriminated against.  Work, after all, is an important part of who we are in society and central to our lives.  The fear of losing one's job for economic reasons can cripple a person physically and psychologically and goes on and on.  Surely this fear will be compounded terribly for a person who suffers in silence.<\/p>  <p>  To follow up on the earlier debate on child and mental health services, CAMHS, while this Bill is welcome, simply banning discrimination is not enough when our mental health services are in such disarray.  Psychiatric nurses, the backbone of our services, are engaged in industrial action by refusing to do overtime.  They do this not to hold the State to ransom as some right-wing commentators might say but to fight for a better service and decent treatment which go hand in hand.  We cannot have good mental healthcare and bad conditions for workers in mental health services.  We must listen to nurses and work and bargain with them because no one wants a better service than they do, and I defy anyone to contradict that.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad Fianna F&aacute;il has introduced this Bill, which I welcome.  I also welcome the positive comments made by Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies on the industrial action taken by nurses.  However, I ask them to put their money where their mouth is because nurses tell me that Fianna F&aacute;il is talking out of both sides of its mouth.  It can run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  A party which backs up a Government that threatens nurses and which votes for a budget that perpetuates the problem is trying to do just that.  I am hearing from nurses that they are not buying it.  I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who put forward the Bill and if I have offended them, I recommend that they direct that feeling of offence at the leadership of their party because their genuine work on this issue is being very much undermined.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the House to support the Bill.  I look forward to discussing it further and exploring possible improvements to strengthen the text on later Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100044#VV00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1548955200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>We are departing a little from the normal order.

I thank the Deputies opposite for bringing this matter to the floor of the House for debate.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, it is an important issue and I know that other Deputies also agree with that.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is aware, the Bill seeks to prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person&rsquo;s mental health status.  Mental health problems are a common human experience and it is believed that they affect around one in four people in any given year.  We can all agree that supporting people who experience difficulties with their mental health is hugely important.  It is something that can happen to anyone at any time in his or her life and children and adults who find themselves in this situation need, and are entitled to, protection and access to the appropriate services as well as our empathy and understanding.<\/p>  <p>  The development of mental health services is a priority for the Government.  The recent budget provided an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health, which brings overall HSE mental health funding to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019.  The HSE is also developing a 24-7 contact line, crisis text line and other e-mental health digital responses.  Additionally, it is working with sports, community and voluntary croups to develop resilience and ultimately reduce the demand for mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  I will now address the Bill, as presented by my colleagues.  It was interesting to hear the reasons and rationale behind the Bill and I welcome this opportunity to respond and contribute to what I am certain will be a good debate.  The Bill, as published, provides for the amendment of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a person&rsquo;s mental health status.  In essence, it seeks to broaden the definition of disability in the equality legislation by introducing a new sub-category known as mental health status.  If agreed, it would be illegal for employers or service providers to discriminate against an individual on the basis of his or her mental health status.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to set out the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of this proposed legislation.  In short, while the Bill is well intentioned, the Government cannot support it for a number of reasons which I will outline.  First and foremost, the Government has been advised by the Attorney General that the proposed provisions are unworkable and that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to see how they could operate in practice.  In the first instance, it would be hard to imagine how an assessment of mental health status would be determined for the purposes of a claim.  I will return to this point shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In their explanatory memorandum, the sponsoring Deputies note that the Bill aims to bring mental health status into the human rights remit and we can all agree that this is a laudable aim.<\/p><p>However, the Attorney General has indicated that a new provision is not needed to ground the existing legislation on a human rights basis, as the existing legislation is already on a human rights footing.<br\/><br\/>I might add that the views of the National Disability Authority also were sought, and the authority, which Members will be aware is independent, has indicated that the proposed amendments seem unworkable to it.  The House will be aware that are currently ten grounds for discrimination in our equality legislation, namely, gender, civil status, race, family status, sexual orientation, age, membership of the Traveller community, disability, religion and housing assistance in regard to the provision of residential accommodation.  The Deputies' Bill, as initiated, proposes to add &quot;mental health status&quot; to these grounds.  In their Bill, &quot;mental health status&quot; is defined as &quot;emotional, psychological and social wellbeing&quot;.  However, an individual&rsquo;s emotional, psychological and social well-being is not easy to define precisely.  Well-being is an unclear, changeable and nebulous state and is too vague an indicator to be used effectively in law.  In the context of equality legislation, it could be very difficult for employers and certain service providers to take action to guard against claims of discrimination in the face of such vague criteria.  Thinking ahead to the possible repercussions, it is not difficult to see how the &quot;mental health status&quot; ground being proposed could facilitate even vexatious claims and spurious allegations.<br\/><br\/> Introducing this concept into the equality legislation could have other unintended consequences.  It is known, for instance, that the stress and anxiety associated with a job interview, exams or any similar situation, which is part and parcel of everyday life and which are things we all have to navigate, can affect different people to varying degrees.  It is arguable that enactment of the Bill could prevent the use of any assessment tools, as they might be found to discriminate against persons who are less well equipped to deal with the stress, which can affect their emotional, psychological and social well-being.<br\/><br\/>It is not just because there are inherent problems with the Bill that the Government is opposing it.  There is also a positive reason for the position the Government is taking, namely, that we already have clear, well-established equality legislation in place that protects people with mental health difficulties from discrimination.  The legislation the Deputies are seeking to amend, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, which has been found to encompass conditions such as depression, anxiety and stress.  In a 2007 ruling, the Equality Tribunal found that an employer had &quot;discriminated against the complainant on the disability ground&quot; and that &quot;the condition or illness which the complainant was suffering from in the course of her absences; depression, stress and anxiety fall within the definition of disability&quot;.  Therefore, it is already there.  The definition of disability has been used in case law to include dyslexia and alcoholism.  The Workplace Relations Commission's latest reports this month on recent cases confirm that work-related stress is commonly accepted as coming within the scope of the disability ground.  In light of this broad interpretation of the existing disability ground, I cannot see why it would be a good idea to introduce a new and nebulous ground into the legislation.<br\/><br\/>I am sure the majority of Members will agree with me when I say that our legal systems are effective in the prohibition of discrimination and victimisation and the promotion of equality.  People experiencing mental health difficulties are legally protected and individuals who believe they have been discriminated against because of mental health conditions can and do access the mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory and adjudication services provided by the Workplace Relations Commission.  I was perturbed to hear the Deputies say that people have been discriminated against and have not sought out this means of redress, which is in place and has been used by others.  I urge colleagues who are aware of people who allege they have been discriminated against on mental health grounds to make use of the facility that is in place.  There is no need to change the law.  That facility is in place and it is being used.<br\/><br\/>I have listened carefully to the sponsoring Deputies this evening, and they have not put forward any compelling evidence that would suggest there is a deficit in the law in terms of protection for people with mental health issues.  The Deputies, in their explanatory memorandum acknowledge that disability is one of the ten grounds of discrimination set out in the Acts and that mental health is included within the definition of disability.  Their argument is that the definition of disability within the Acts provides a restrictive medical definition of disability.  I am afraid I cannot accept this argument.  As I mentioned, the definition of disability in the Acts is very broad and has been held to include stress, depression and anxiety, as I outlined.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, while the Bill purports to move away from the medical model, it is hard to see how any discrimination cases could be advanced without evidence from a medical practitioner or other health professional.  How does one prove, for instance, that one has a mental health issue?  If a self-certification model is what is being proposed in the Bill, then I believe it would also be problematic, and I am sure the Deputies would agree with me on that, as it would just not be credible and would expose employers and service providers to potentially spurious claims.<br\/><br\/>I am aware the Ceann Comhairle has initiated some work for Members and staff of the Houses with regard to well-being, and some very good work is being done, but well-being is a continuum.  Throughout the course of a day all of us can be in good form, bad form, fed up or very fed up, and so on, depending on what comes at us, how we are feeling and our physical and mental health.  It is a continuum and it changes all the time.  Well-being is very nebulous.  Social well-being is not defined.  I believe what we already have in place is good and strong enough, it is being used and has already been used to great effect.  More people should use it.  We should let people know that we already have the legislation in place and if people are discriminated against on the grounds of disability, which includes mental health, then they have a means of redress which is already in place.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this Bill.  It deals with a very important issue.  I do not doubt their sincerity in this regard.  The Government agrees with the Deputies as to the need to support people with mental health difficulties.  This Bill, as the Attorney General and the National Disability Authority have said, is not workable, it is not needed and could be counterproductive in terms of increasing support and understanding of people with mental health issues.  I hope the sponsoring Deputies will consider the issues I have outlined to the House this evening and not press the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100044#VV00500","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548955800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I will brief.

The Minister of State spoke about how the classification of a mental illness under the disability legislation has been expanded but if a citizen has to go rooting around case law to know his or her rights, that is not a positive situation.  Our law should be very clear.  Citizens should know their rights clearly from the legislation.  That is not the case currently because people simply are not exercising their rights under the existing legislation.  I also disagree in terms of not expanding it.  It needs to be expanded.
