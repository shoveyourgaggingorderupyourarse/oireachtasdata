The issue I raise is the change to the zero rate of VAT for vitamins and minerals.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Finance clearly articulated the view that these are matters for the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance, rather than his Department or the Department of Health.  I appeal to the Minister of State to have this matter reviewed on a number of grounds, one of which relates to health.  It does not make sense to charge a VAT rate of 13.5% on fast food, such as burgers, chips and other greasy foods, particularly in the context of the national health strategy, when the Revenue is prepared to impose a VAT rate of 23% on health supplements from next month onwards.  I noted the Taoiseach's statement in the Lower House - I checked the record today - that he was not in a position to confirm the higher rate would apply to iron supplements or folic acid but he would revert to the House on the matter.<\/p> <p>I spoke to a number of general practitioners when researching this issue.  My GP prescribes vitamin B12, folic acid and fish oils to patients.  There are issues in this regard.  I am not suggesting this for the benefit of those who are popping vitamins every day of the week.  That is not right.  However, GPs tell me they are prescribing these vitamins and mineral supplements - let us not call them drugs - on which Revenue will charge VAT.  One must ask what the Government can do about it.  I presume there it may be possible to address the matter in a finance Bill or other legislation.  Maybe we should distinguish between cases where vitamins are prescribed and those where they are not prescribed.  I would generally like these vitamins to be zero rated for VAT, as has been the case since 1972.  I ask the Minister of State to consider with his colleagues whether we can set up a consultation process to engage on this matter with stakeholders.<\/p> <p>As someone who lives near Gorey, the Minister of State will know how important our provincial towns area.  Supplement and health shops, in particular in rural communities, rely on this legitimate and legal business.  We need to support them against the major multiples in the cities.  This decision raises many issues for rural communities and rural traders.  More important, there is substantial employment associated with the supplements industry and we need to be careful how we impact on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#B00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>To address the Senator's direct request to me, the Department is reviewing this matter.  That commitment was given by the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in October last.<\/p> <p>On a point of clarification, basic vitamins, minerals and fish oils are zero rated.  The standard rate of VAT applies to food supplements.  However, there is a Revenue concession which allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT in November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small.  The concession meant that vitamins, minerals and fish supplements were treated the same as food for VAT purposes.  However, since the 1970s there has been significant growth in the number and complexity of food supplement products on the market, most of which are not covered by the zero rate concession, such as supplements containing botanicals and bioactive substances.  While these new products apply at the standard rate of VAT, the growing variety of products in the market led to diverging views between Revenue and industry over which food supplement should be at the zero rate versus the 23% rate.  Revenue issued eBriefs in 2011 and 2013 in an effort to clarify that only basic vitamins, minerals and fish oil would qualify for the zero rate.  However, disagreement on the applicable VAT rate and queries on specific products continued.<\/p> <p>The operation of the current concession has become problematic because of efforts by some businesses in the industry to exploit the concession to extend zero rating beyond the scope permitted by Revenue.  Some businesses have challenged Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products giving rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.<\/p> <p>The issue was raised during debates on the Finance Bill 2018.  Deputies and Senators looked for clarity for industry on the VAT treatment of food supplements and sought the retention of the zero rate for certain categories of food supplements.  On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed that he would ask his officials to address the matter in the context of the tax strategy group and also stated he would not interfere in any decision made by Revenue on the matter in the interim.  Revenue published new guidance on 27 December 2018 concerning the rate of VAT that applies to food supplements, announcing its intention to apply the 23% VAT rate to most food supplements with effect from 1 March of this year.<\/p> <p>It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  It is possible to retain these products at the zero rate because they qualify as oral medicines, which are charged to VAT at the zero rate in Ireland under an historical derogation to EU VAT law.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated.<\/p> <p>I understand the concerns of industry in this matter.  For this reason, independent of Revenue's decisions on interpretation, the Minister agreed to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 tax strategy group paper to examine the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.<\/p> <p>As I stated in the Lower House yesterday, the Revenue is independent of these Houses and the Minister has said he will not intervene with Revenue.  That is long-standing practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#B00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply and welcome the decision to have the tax strategy group produce a paper on the matter.<\/p> <p>The recurring theme is that we need to look at alternatives.

I know there are peculiar anomalies with food.  As the Senator mentioned, products sold by unhealthy fast food outlets are at the lower VAT rate of 13.5%, while potentially healthy products that may be prescribed and may be really beneficial to people's health could be at the 23% rate.

He made contact about it last night, in fairness.  I am calling for an update regarding the purchase of a site for a Gaelscoil in Kinsale.  The Gaelscoil has been a unique and thriving part of our community for 11 years, during which, unfortunately, it has been housed in prefabs.  One of these buildings had to be abandoned last year because of the condition it was in.  It has been an ongoing debacle trying to secure a site for a permanent school.<\/p> <p>Kinsale is a unique location.  In the past ten years, its population has grown by 23%, which is significant when we consider our population growth nationally.  The need for a permanent structure and site for the Gaelscoil has been talked about for over a decade.  We have moved an awful long way along this path.  We have identified a five acre site, which the local authority, as the purchasing power, and the Department have agreed is suitable.  Contracts were submitted to the Chief State Solicitor's office last October.  We are trying to get these contracts out to start the process, which is part of the Government's schools building programme.  For that to happen, this roadblock needs to be lifted.

We need to find a solution.  The solution is to purchase the beautiful five acre site that has been identified.  We need the Chief State Solicitor's office to remove these blockages so we can deliver the school for the people in the surrounding community of Kinsale.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State can give me some detail regarding what the Chief State Solicitor's office is planning to do and whether the matter can be moved forward.

In that context, the Department of Education and Skills has been working closely with Cork County Council under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites with a view to securing a suitable site for this school.  Under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites, local authorities assist the Department with the process of identifying and acquiring sites for the development of school accommodation. The first step in this process is the identification of suitable sites by the local authority.

There simply is not enough of a return on the investment made for some farmers.  As the margins are too tight, many have to consider their future.  This is a very serious issue in rural Ireland.  There is the issue of oversupply and a drop in prices which, in turn, is leading to a crisis of confidence throughout the industry.  During the week ending 20 January, the number of cattle processed by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine beef export plants totalled 36,656.  During the same week in 2017 the figure was 33,256.  Unfortunately, the slump in cattle prices before Christmas has continued into 2019, with many factories quoting unchanged prices.  Farmers are struggling to have stock killed, with many having to wait weeks.  Ultimately, the prices achieved are unsustainable.  This cannot continue.  We need a clear plan.  What measures and additional supports are being developed and considered by the Minister of State to address the issue?  <\/p> <p>There are growing concerns about the viability of the agrifood sector.  What help is being offered to those who need it most?  The growing cloud of Brexit is also hanging over us.  There is a distinct feeling of despair surrounding beef exports to the UK market, particularly in the event that there is a hard Brexit.  Earlier this month it was deeply worrying and concerning to hear the president of the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. Joe Healy, warning that if the United Kingdom crashed out of the European Union, \"We are facing ... [a] potential wipe-out of beef production in this country.\"  According to Bord Bia, total Irish exports of beef in 2017 amounted to 556,000 tons, of which 51% with a value of &euro;1.3 billion went to the United Kingdom.  We need to know what plan the Government has to support all of the farmers who have invested so heavily in their stock, their livelihoods and those of their families who need to know where they stand.  They also need more detail of the aid packages the Government has stated it will demand from Brussels in the event that there is a hard Brexit.  We also need clarity on the state of play for beef producer organisations.  How does the Minister of State envision it panning out in the future?  <\/p> <p>The beef plan group has added its voice on the issue and been holding a series of public meetings across the country to seek support for the beef plan policy.  It seems to be striking a chord with many farmers in rural Ireland.  It has pinpointed what it sees as a lack of support from the market for a quality beef product as a major problem, as well as processors paying below the cost of production for such a product.  It believes there is an oversupply of cattle in the market.  To tackle the issue it has suggested removing mandatory stocking levels.  It is aiming for the introduction of a programme centred on sustainable quality assurance instead of quantity driven policies.  Such a measure should help to increase the price of beef.  The group is also calling for incentives to be introduced which would see beef producers who exit the market switch instead to fodder production programmes and-or environmental schemes which, in turn, would create a greater balance in the sector.<\/p> <p>Farmers are under severe pressure and their stress levels are extremely high.  They need the Government to provide clarity for beef producers.  How does it plans to tackle this issue in the next few months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#D00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>As an active beef farmer I am very conscious that 2018, in particular, was a difficult year for the beef sector due to unprecedented weather events which resulted in increased input costs owing to fodder shortages.  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing the beef sector.  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision for its sustainable development in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has utilised the beef round table to highlight the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency and support the sector through an examination of mechanisms to add value along the supply chain and increase the strength of all links, including beef producer organisations.  My Department is engaging extensively with stakeholders in beef producer organisations which have strong potential to strengthen the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.  I firmly believe producer organisations have the potential to play a very important role in this area.  My Department is continuing in its efforts to drive the potential of the scheme through engagement with an array of stakeholders across fora.  It has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme for the period 2014 to 2020.  <\/p> <p>The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is the main support specifically targeted at the suckler cow sector which will provide beef farmers with &euro;300 million in funding during the current rural development programme period. The scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler cow herd by increasing genetic merit within it.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports available to suckler cow and sheep farmers under pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, include the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS; the areas of natural constraint, ANCs, and knowledge transfer groups.  Suckler cow farmers also benefit from the basic payment scheme, BPS, and greening payments under pillar 1.<\/p> <p>The national farm survey data suggest suckler cow farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  It is also envisaged that suckler cow farmers will be the primary beneficiaries of the &euro;23 million increase in ANC payments, in addition to the &euro;20 million available under the beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme being announced by the Minister, which is why he has had to send his apologies to the House.  The scheme is targeted at suckler cow farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production.  The Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different sectors, including the suckler cow sector, in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  We are committed to ensuring suckler cow farmers will continue to receive strong support under the next CAP.  Such payments should support and encourage suckler cow farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming systems. <\/p> <p>The development of markets for Irish beef was a particular priority for many of the trade missions in 2017 and 2018.  The opening last year of the Chinese market to Irish beef marked the culmination of significant work over a period of years.  The Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain market access to new third country markets and, equally as important, deepen existing markets for Irish beef products.  I am deeply committed to ensuring suckler cow farmers will continue to receive strong support under the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler cow farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and environmental efficiency of their farming systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#D00300","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I raise this matter because of the urgency attached to it.

I would appreciate it if the Minister of State gave them serious consideration as rural Ireland depends greatly on farmers doing well.  If farmers do well, the local economy tends to do well also.

Yes, 50% less is half of the pay.  Irish nurses are, in some instances, being paid 50% less than their colleagues working abroad who have the same qualifications.  We know that before they even finish their degree and go out on their own, nurses are considering emigrating.  We also know that the nurses that we currently employ in our hospitals are overworked and stresses are beginning to be felt by patients.<\/p> <p>We all have many anecdotes about how the health service is being affected.  The other day I met a lady who told me about her experience.  She went to hospital because she had a sore leg after falling off her bike.  She ended up falling off a trolley and breaking a tooth because her concussion was so bad and the nurse in charge was on her own.  It was not a case that the nurse had not looked after the woman properly but of the nurse in charge being completely stretched in every possible way to meet demands.  I ask the Minister for Health to engage with the nurses in a meaningful manner to ensure the strike does not continue.  We cannot have six days of Irish nurses being on strike.  It is not helpful at all.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to anti-social behaviour and drug dealing on city streets.  A technology company that has been in operation for 17 years has been forced to move out of the inner city area because of drug dealing and anti-social behaviour at the door of its premises.  Such negative behaviour is not just confined to that area because when one walks from Christchurch to the Guinness Storehouse or Kilmainham Gaol one frequently sees drug dealing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It seems to be done without any issue.  There does not seem to be any fear of arrest or any deterrent whatsoever.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to look at this matter.  This is a tourist area containing various distilleries, Kilmainham Gaol and the Guinness Storehouse, and people are openly dealing drugs on the street, so it is a very serious matter.  It affects the tourism industry and the communities living in these areas, because it is just not nice to have people dealing drugs on one's doorstep.<\/p><p>The third issue I want to raise is one that is hugely concerning to all of us, particularly after the passing of the Brady amendment last night.  Ultimately, we learned today that a hard Border will impact very negatively on the Irish economy.  We have been told that if a hard Brexit occurs, there will be an increase in unemployment of up to 2%, which could be up to 50,000 people.  The chat about renegotiating the backstop is very worrying.  We wish the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, the best.  We are behind them 100% but it is very scary, especially with regard to our preparedness.  I have a small business and have had no interaction with the Government in terms of help, support and how it will affect us, and neither has the business community in Crumlin.  I am a solicitor and I can say that the level of conveyancing has dropped.  People and the markets in Dublin are very scared.  People are not engaging in transactions at the same volume they did in recent months, and I believe it is because of the significant amount of fear about Brexit.   There is a lot of fear among the business community, particularly if the UK crashes out.  I ask the Leader to consider these matters and I look forward to hearing his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#G01200","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will make one point about Theresa May.  What happened last night was possibly the greatest example of reneging in the history of politics.<\/p> <p>I wish to take up what Senator Ardagh said about the nurses.  I look around at the nurses on strike, their reasons for doing so, the 262 consultant posts that have not been filled, consultants in Irish hospitals who have not gone through the registered training programme, and the lack of radiographers and occupational therapists.  At the same time, I see an overrun of &euro;1.7 billion on the national children's hospital.  The two do not compute.  There is something very unstable about this situation.  I am not blaming anybody but there is something very unbalanced about all of this.  The public is getting very tired of it.<\/p> <p>I wish to ask the Leader about the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  I have reached the age of an elder even though I know I look 37.  I am very conscious of how we treat our elders.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act has not been commenced and there is no reason sections 3 and 8 involving advanced healthcare directives should not be commenced.  I would like very much to see that happen because they give effect to the requirements of common law.  I know other Senators have worked on this and know the intricacies of this, but the fact that these sections have not been commenced gives rise to inappropriate assessments of older people being carried out based on the medical model which is not the total model and is not the model that should be the end assessment.  A person's basic human rights are involved here.  &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed director of the Decision Support Service in October 2017 and is currently working on setting up her office and putting systems in place.  The HSE and the National Disability Association did a lot of work on codes of practice.  The codes regarding advanced healthcare directives are at the final stage.  However, there seems to be a lack of drive in the Government and Departments.  It is now three times since I stood here and spoke for it.<\/p> <p>A breach of rights is occurring so I would like some explanation of this.  I know there are a lot of problems, but as we age, it involves people's rights.  People are being put into nursing homes who do not want to be there.  They have rights in those nursing homes.  My mother is in a nursing home.  I do not want to present myself as a visual aid example but I am very conscious of the elders in Ireland and how we treat them and I wish to see their rights preserved in every way.  This needs to come back in and we need to advance it because it is lying around, so to speak.  People are in place to do it but it has not been ignited and a certain activity is lacking.  Things are happening with regard to Brexit and nurses are out on the street but this is very important.  What was interesting was that I saw today how many carers and nurses who deal with the elderly were outside the gates of facilities on Roebuck Road and in other areas where homes operate, so could we please have this commenced or have a discussion about it?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#H00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I endorse the sentiments expressed and points made by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  We very much need to progress the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.<\/p><p>I wish to raise two recent reports with major significance for the Traveller community.  The first is the findings of the inquest into the Carrickmines fire tragedy, which were published last week.  As we know, ten people lost their lives in this fire.  I acknowledge how difficult the process must have been for the families affected.  It is worth noting and was highlighted in an excellent article by Jacinta Brack of the Irish Traveller Movement in today's edition of <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>that in the year following the Carrickmines fire, three other fires occurred at halting sites in Ballyfermot, Limerick and Wicklow.  Thankfully, there was no loss of life but safety remains a major concern, especially on overcrowded sites.  This matter has not been addressed adequately.  I welcome the recommendations made in the inquest report.  It is important for all of us to know about them, take them on board and monitor Government leadership and action on them.<\/p><p>According to the Irish Traveller Movement, since the publication of the report of the National Directorate Fire and Emergency Management in September 2016, the threats to the safety of Travellers posed by substandard accommodation remain a clear and present danger.  The number of Traveller families living in overcrowded conditions has risen and now stands at more than 1,000 families, an increase in excess of 150 families since the report of the National Directorate Fire and Emergency Management was published three years ago.  The impact in terms of the numbers of people affected is rising.  The Irish Traveller Movement contends that there is a direct correlation between overcrowding and shared accommodation, which poses a fundamental threat to the safety of Travellers.<\/p><p>Three years on, these threats have not been adequately addressed.  According to the director of the Irish Traveller Movement, Bernard Joyce, there has been no national audit of Traveller fire safety since 2016 and no monitoring report of the completion of the programme from the first review.  While some local authorities have worked towards fire prevention strategies, there is no audit of completion or fulfilment.  The inadequate provision of accommodation for Travellers is at an all-time high.  There have been other fires since 2015.  The review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act that is under way must take into account overcrowding and the poor standard of existing temporary Traveller accommodation and its overuse for long-term stays.  The dangers faced by Travellers living in overcrowded conditions remain and I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to outline the measures that are being put in place to ensure that tragedies like Carrickmines never happen again.<\/p><p>I also ask that the Leader invite the Minister to respond to a European Committee of Social Rights report that was also published last week.  The report found that Ireland failed to redress violations in breach of the European Social Charter related to five grounds for Travellers, including insufficient provision and inadequate quality of Traveller accommodation, breaches involving the operation of evictions and the lack of legal aid for those threatened.  In light of both reports, will the Leader ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to give us a full update of the Government's responses to the Carrickmines fire report, the European Committee of Social Rights and the review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act that is in train?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#H00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I wish to show solidarity with the thousands of nurses on picket lines all over this State and the thousands of patients and vulnerable people who have had their operations, procedures and appointments postponed.

I visited the picket lines in Dundalk and Drogheda this morning.  To say that the determination of the nurses is very strong is not to put too fine a point on it.  Those of us who have been involved in industrial action and the industrial relations process know that it is a big decision for any worker to withdraw his or her labour.  There are implications, for example, lost income.  For nurses in particular, who take their jobs and roles so seriously, it is a major decision to take.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the nurses in the INMO felt that they had no option other than to take action.  They are involved in a legitimate trade dispute that unfortunately shows no sign of ending.  However, I firmly believe that a way can be found within the parameters of the current public sector pay agreement to reach a negotiated settlement that would benefit the nurses without significantly impacting the integrity of the overall public sector pay agreement.<\/p> <p>We should not be in this position today, but a lack of imagination and lateral thinking has been shown by the Government side in its handling of the issue.  It pains me to say it, but in the context of this and a range of other disputes, the Government has shown a tin ear in its approach to industrial relations.  This issue can be fixed if the political will is there, but I do not detect that will.  A way can be found through the current pay agreement to address the nurses' concerns while retaining the integrity of that agreement if imagination and lateral thinking are shown by the Government side.<\/p> <p>As if we needed reminding, the events in Westminster last night reminded us of the existential importance of the retention of the backstop in the British withdrawal agreement from Europe.  In pandering to the extreme elements of the Tory Party's European Research Group, Prime Minister May has shown a willingness to throw Ireland under the proverbial bus.  I stood in solidarity with my constituents in Carrickarnon on the Northern Ireland - Republic of Ireland Border last Saturday.  The message there was clear - communities on both sides of the Border, be they nationalist or unionist, did not want a hard Brexit or a hard border on this island.  We spoke about solidarity with the nurses, but never before has the solidarity of the EU been more important for Ireland than in the backstop's retention.<\/p> <p>On Friday I will meet my colleague, the German Federal Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection, and an SPD member, Dr. Katarina Barley, who has requested to come to Ireland to discuss Brexit and the reality of life on the Border with residents from north Louth.  I look forward to welcoming her.  It is important that we use all of the channels, connections and networks available to us - Fine Gael is associated with the Christian democrat group and the Labour Party is associated with the socialist group, the second largest political grouping in the European Parliament - to convince our European partners of the fundamental importance of retaining the backstop in protecting Ireland's interests North and South and the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#J00600","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I rise to highlight the more than 35,000 nurses on the picket lines.

This year, it will occur on 5 February.  I raise this matter because we were appalled last week when we heard of the sharing of a video of a deceased person following a fatal crash on the M50.  That the Garda had to issue a request shows how far we have sunk as a nation.  We need to have the conversation that is called for on 5 February about what we can do in these cases.  We need to debate the Internet and how to protect our children from a world in which nothing is sacred anymore.<\/p> <p>I call for a debate on how to adjust our current legislation so as to bring the full force of the law down on people for their blatant lack of humanity.  While we cannot legislate for bad taste, we should be able to legislate against social media companies allowing instant sharing of such imagery before the authorities have even identified the deceased.  I was shocked by what happened and we need to address the issue.  We need to have this conversation on 5 February and to ensure that this can never happen again.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will bring this up again with the Minister.<\/p><p>Going back to the nurses, all of us here need to support the hard-working nurses today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#J00800","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader and his office for sending out today's proposed Order of Business.

There were approximately 10.6 million visitors, with significant increases in the North American market.  This is important because tourism is a critical part of the economy.  With this in mind, I ask that we invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in, particularly to debate how we might keep the momentum going but to debate the potential ramifications and proposals to curtail the operation of Airbnb.  It is not an area that we debate often.  I believe Airbnb has played a significant role in encouraging tourists to come into the country and making accommodation available and there needs to be a full debate about that.<\/p> <p>Obviously, Brexit is of grave concern, as is the potential further fall in the value of sterling arising from it and the spending power of the British market to come here.  I note that the increase in visitors from Britain this year was only 1%.  It was one of the lowest growth areas for tourism, which is disappointing.  The most important element, which I welcome, is the progress and the growth in the tourism sector.<\/p> <p>There are rural areas which are underdeveloped and have considerable tourism potential.  The challenge, for Tourism Ireland and the different agencies that are given the responsibility of developing tourism, is to go to the areas, such as north Mayo, which has considerable potential on the Wild Atlantic Way.  Once one hits Westport, one is not as inclined to travel north of that.  The Minister must ensure that there is proper promotion given to these areas that need a boost and put in proper tourism infrastructure, by which I mean tourist information offices.  For example, in Ballina, the tourism office is run on a shoestring and needs further support to run in the professional manner necessary to support the region.  These are pertinent issues because tourism is often one of the few alternatives for employment in rural areas.  I ask the Leader to look at this as something that we might deal with in early course and have the Minister in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#K02200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>As today is strike day, I am hardly going to get up and talk about anything else.  This morning, I have been around, in the cold but crisp sunshine, to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, St. James's Hospital, both the Rialto entrance and James's Street entrance, and the Coombe on Cork Street.  I visited all three of them and plan to visit some more later on.<\/p> <p>I think back to 20 years ago.  In 1999, I was part of a strike committee, the national nurses strike committee.  It took us nine days and nine nights in a row out on the picket line to get the Government to eventually sit down and talk, to realise it needed to be proactive, to understand and work out how to retain, recruit and keep nurses in the hospitals looking after the patients.<\/p> <p>Today is the first day of the strike.  There are many more planned.  I hope it does not take as long - nine days and nine nights - for the Minister and the Department to come to their senses and sit down with nurses.<\/p> <p>The spirits are high.  The public are behind them, despite the spin from Fine Gael and from the fourth estate.

The striking level of public support for the strikers is because people understand this is not simply an issue for some workers but is an issue about decent standards and safety for the nurses and front-line staff and for patients.  It is about ensuring that the lifeblood of the health system, which nurses are, are able and supported to work in decent conditions.  That is something that is important for every citizen.  People recognise and are in solidarity with the nurses for that reason.<\/p> <p>It is unfortunate that we have seen Brexit being thrown as a reason for not taking action.  We should note now it will not be acceptable to use this as the card repeatedly in areas of action.  Unless there is a moratorium on the cost of living, on rent and on the considerable costs that nurses carry to live and work in our towns and cities, one cannot ask them to continue to live on wages and work in conditions that are inadequate.  Indeed, the UK has been an issue in nursing because we have lost so many nurses there.  We have lost nurses to all places over the world because we are not addressing the decency of conditions they need.

We can engage with other countries such as Hungary.  I note that another great advocate for workers' rights, Luke Kelly, is being celebrated today by the city of Dublin with the unveiling of two statues.  He sang \"School Days Over\", \"Springhill Mine Disaster\" and \"Joe Hill\" and it is wonderful to see him being marked, in particular, in the year after his brother, another wonderful workers' activist, Mr. Jimmy Kelly, a great personal friend of mine and many others, passed away.

It is the taxpayer who pays and there is only a certain amount of money that comes in in taxation.  I have met nurses who have returned from Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the USA and their biggest complaints about pay and conditions here fall under three headings, one of which is the level of taxation.  One can earn up to &pound;50,000 in the United Kingdom before reaching the higher tax rate.  In Ireland the figure is &euro;35,500.  The second issue they raise is non-recognition of further education, one the Department and the HSE must tackle immediately.  It is a key issue to be addressed in the context of allowances and time allowed.  The third issue is overtime and hours owing, but it is not being followed through.  In other words, it is not about overtime but about being given an allowance for hours owing, something which is not taken into account and about which a lot of nurses are very unhappy.  Another issue is the huge deficiency in managerial skills in hospitals.  I refer to the management of issues as they arise.  One example I have come across in the past week or two involves nurses who have been threatened within emergency departments, with no sufficient action taken to provide adequate security for them.  The people who cause these difficulties are attending to receive care or are the individuals who accompany them.  They also have a responsibility.  If we want people to work in front-line services, we must provide adequate security for them.  I criticise management for failing to act appropriately in some areas.  While there are issues which must be dealt with, there is also the issue of how it will be paid for.  The last thing we need is to see a recurrence of what happened in the years between 2000 and 2008 when there were consistent increases in salaries and wages which meant that when the downturn came, we were unable to manage.  If one allows this problem to fester, it will spread across the entire public sector.  It is something that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#L00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I highlight the global health crisis of septicaemia and sepsis which affects approximately 30 million people every year across the world and kills 9 million.  In Ireland 3,000 people die from sepsis each year.  It claims more lives than heart attack, breast cancer or lung cancer.  It can kill a person within 12 hours, as the parents of Sean Hughes from Finglas, Joe and Karen, know all about.  Sean was only 15 years old when he suddenly lost consciousness while watching television with his mother and recovering from a simple flu-like illness.  Despite the best efforts of his father and paramedics to resuscitate him, he died later in Temple Street Hospital.  His parents are calling for a nationwide awareness campaign to highlight the signs and symptoms of sepsis.  I support them and hope I will get the support of the House in that regard also.  Sean&rsquo;s parents want the HSE and health professionals to formulate new protocols for the diagnosis of sepsis and the procedures used because it is important to pick up and treat this killer disease as soon as possible.   It is being missed and people are dying unnecessarily.  Karen and Joe did not know what sepsis was and are not alone.  According to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, it is estimated that only 28% of Irish people have an accurate understanding of what sepsis is.  When one presents at an outpatients department or a GP&rsquo;s surgery, one often sees literature on public information campaigns such as the campaign on meningitis and the FAST campaign on the signs and symptoms of stroke.  There is a need for a similar campaign to educate people about sepsis.  A similar check list must be created to the ones featured in other campaigns.  Sepsis can occur quickly.  While one&rsquo;s immune system normally fights infection, it sometimes fails and people experience multi-organ failure and die as a result of sepsis.  However, if it is diagnosed early, t can be treated easily with antibiotics.  Anyone, however young and healthy, is at risk of dying from sepsis.  World Sepsis Day is 13 September.  It is time to treat this issue with the seriousness it demands.  We must ensure people are aware of what sepsis is, understand the risk factors and know how to combat it.  By 13 September every household in the country should have been made aware of a disease which kills more Irish people than heart attack, breast cancer and lung cancer.

It is a beautiful morning in Dublin, but there was a dusting of snow in Cork, as a result of which we experienced two and a half hour delays to get into the city from Bandon and Kinsale.  Where is the winter maintenance plan?  There was a major snow event last year, from which it seems we learned nothing.  We are moving from January into February and may now be too late.  However, we need the Minister with responsibility for local government to attend the House to explain what the priorities are.  A dusting of snow in Cork has resulted in school closures and two and a half hour delays on major infrastructure in entering Cork city from Carrs Hill and Bandon, which makes no logical sense in the environment and society we are trying to build.

It must be nationally led and a significant plan must be put in place.  I am horrified by what I have heard has happened in Cork in the past few hours.  The Leader is from that part of the world and knows what the issues are.  He is very aware of the morning people have had there.  We must have a real debate next week with the Minister with responsibility for local government on what he plans to do about this issue in the next few weeks.  If we do not, the country will grind to a halt if there is another fall of snow.  It is beyond belief.  Have we learned anything in the past 12 months?

I know first hand from my own town in Boyle, where we do not have a hotel, that over the winter and the summer many people stay in farmhouses and houses around the country.  With all of these new apps and modern technology such as Google Maps, they are finding their way to country lanes and this is actually helping the tourism industry and many of the restaurants in the region and in areas that do not have huge tourism infrastructure.  While Airbnb is causing some issues in Dublin it has also helped the tourism industry in Dublin, and especially around the country where we do not have that infrastructure.  The amount of people coming to stay in those areas is absolutely magnificent.<\/p> <p>Last night 370 Members of Parliament in Westminster voted to remove the backstop and replace it with we do not know what.  It is extremely difficult and embarrassing and it looks as though the United Kingdom is now negotiating with itself.  This is all about uniting the Conservative Party.  It is not about the United Kingdom, it is not about the EU and it certainly is not about the island of Ireland.  The backstop in the withdrawal agreement was negotiated for two and half years and the backstop was an invention of the United Kingdom negotiation team as part of the UK red lines.  As David McWilliams quoted recently, it is less \"Britannia rules the waves\" and more like \"Britannia waives the rules\".  In a rules-based democracy this is very dangerous.  I am aware that in the House of Commons and the House of Lords the vast majority of MPs and lords are decent, honourable people who understand what is happening.  It is now time for politicians to stand up and be counted.

The leader of that Parliament has had his bank accounts frozen and he has been banned from foreign travel.  We are seeing Mr. Maduro putting on the heavy hand to shore up his highly discredited regime.  Venezuela is facing a humanitarian crisis and it is endangering the lives of Venezuelans due to severe food and medical shortages as we know.  Some 61% of the people in that country are living in extreme poverty.  Due to the massive shortages of necessary medicines it is medical hell for anybody with a severe medical condition.<\/p> <p>Last week I met with representatives of the Venezuelan community in Ireland who gathered outside the D&aacute;il.  They want the Government to take a particular interest in their country's crisis and in the challenges facing their people at home and abroad.  Some 3 million people have emigrated from Venezuela since 2014.  This situation impacts, not just on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade's brief, but also on the Minister for Justice and Equality's brief.  The Venezuelan people in Ireland want the Government to recognise that Venezuela is facing a humanitarian crisis that is endangering the lives of Venezuelans due to severe food and medical shortages.  They want to see our Government implement the UNHCR guidance notes on the outflow of Venezuelans.  This is where the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, comes in with regard to the particular needs of Venezuelans in Ireland due to the crisis in their country and with regard to the recognition and status within the country.  They also want the Government to recognise Juan Guaid&oacute;, the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as the new and legitimate interim President, pending elections.   They wonder what the hell Sinn F&eacute;in was doing sending two members to be present at the inauguration of this bizarre person who has been running his country into the ground in the most bizarre of ways.  On this occasion it would be good if our Ministers spoke for Ireland and that we did not just wait for the EU to speak for Ireland.  I would be very grateful to the Leader if we could have some response from the Government to this emerging and developing crisis in early course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#M00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I welcome and acknowledge Deputy Willie O'Dea and his guests in the Gallery.

Like many of us, last night I watched the Brexit deliberations on the BBC.  In the middle of all the shemozzle about Brexit, Orla Guerin - an Irish person and a wonderful journalist - was in Venezuela reporting on the campaign.  The cameras showed the shops with absolutely no food and people, human beings, going through bins to try to extract something to eat.  Ms Guerin interviewed a young family comprising a single mother of six children and the children were starving.  Anywhere that the Government can intervene to try to help that situation would be most welcome.<\/p> <p>We had a very interesting day in the Seanad yesterday when the president of the GAA came to the Chamber.  It was a great initiative.  I made a proposal for an all-party friendship group in Gaelic games.  I plan on advancing this and I will email all Members next week for expressions of interest if they want to be part of that group.  We will organise some sort of a meeting towards the end of February.  That is certainly worth noting.<\/p> <p>On Brexit and the effect on tourism, I commend the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience for an initiative yesterday that any new service level agreements with coach companies will include a rule on going to another fee-paying destination in County Clare, coupled with proof of an overnight stay.

I hope he does not come back as a Minister any time soon but he is always welcome to the Gallery.  I thank the 19 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business.  At the outset I will begin by complimenting the Cathaoirleach and the staff of the Seanad and of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the organisation of the visit of uachtar&aacute;n an Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  It was a wonderful occasion that showcased the work of an Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael but also highlighted the importance of allowing the Upper House to invite people of distinction in to make an address.  I commend all on their involvement in the organisation of yesterday's event.<\/p> <p>Ten Senators, including Senators Ardagh, Conway-Walsh, Nash, Byrne, Murnane O'Connor, Devine, Higgins, Colm Burke, and Black, raised the issue of today's nurses' strike.  On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf, I will say that we all respect and value the nurses who work in our hospitals.  They do a very difficult job, in many cases in very trying situations, in a very specialised and pressurised field.  Significant recruitment has been undertaken in recent years, to the tune of 3,000 new recruits to the nursing profession.  Nobody on this side of the House is contesting the value of the nursing profession and its importance to the delivery of a safe health system.  However, the Government has a public sector agreement to which the INMO signed up and agreed.  Significant pay restoration has been given to many public sector workers.  If we breach the public sector pay deal for one organisation, there will be a knock-on effect.  The Members opposite me will come in here every day the House sits looking for extra money for different areas and we will have a free-for-all.  We benefit from collective pay bargaining.  We respect the nurses and their right to go on strike.  I have no issue with that whatsoever, but it is important to recognise that the cost implication is &euro;300 million.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, it is about being fair to all other public sector workers, being fair to patients, and affordability.  <\/p> <p>On my own behalf and, as the Leader of the House, on behalf of Government, I will say that it is imperative and important that we resolve this issue.  As Senator Colm Burke stated very articulately in his contribution, there are significant points that need to be addressed with regard to recognising degree qualifications, taxation, and recognising posts of responsibility and so on.  That can be done.  It is disappointing on one level that the machinery of the State opted out on Tuesday evening when it has a role to play in the resolution of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#N00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#N00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I hope this will be resolved.

It is a matter of huge concern.  I highlight to the Senator that her concerns might be better articulated to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who has responsibility for drugs and local drugs task forces, and to the Minister for Justice and Equality through a Commencement matter.  The local joint policing committee could also pursue the issue.  We will have the Minister come to the House in due course to discuss the Senator's point.<\/p> <p>A number of Members of the House, including Senators Ardagh, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Nash, Feighan and Conway, raised the issue of Brexit.  It is absolutely extraordinary that last night the UK House of Commons again voted to renege on a commitment made by the UK's Prime Minister.  As a country and a government, we had an agreement which had been signed up to by the UK Government.  Theresa May advocated for the need for the backstop.  We can read her speeches on the backstop.  It is only in recent days that she seems to have changed her mind in order to facilitate and appease some of her own colleagues in the Tory Party.  It is disappointing that she has done so.  Ireland has been consistent in our position in respect of protecting the interests of our country on an all-island basis.  To see the Prime Minister vote against her own deal is disappointing.  We have not seen an alternative from the British Government.  We need to see it.  I was heartened by the remarks of Donald Tusk, the Taoiseach, and the T&aacute;naiste last night and today.  They said that our position is not going to change.  There is no such thing as a good outcome to Brexit.  It is now incumbent on the European Union to stand with Ireland but it is equally important that the British Government puts forward an alternative, as it has not done to date.  Doing this deal has taken two years.  It is extraordinary.  The best thing we can do now is to stand with the Minister, Deputy Coveney; the Minster of State, Deputy McEntee; the Taoiseach; and the European Union in working to ensure a resolution.  We need a resolution to the issue of the backstop.<\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the very important issue of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I will be happy to take up the matter of the commencement of sections 3 and 8 with the Department.  The points the Senator made are very relevant.<\/p> <p>Senator Kelleher raised two very important matters regarding the Travelling community.  We were all appalled at the tragedy that took place in Carrickmines.  We remember those families who are still in mourning today.  All members of local authorities and all of us, as public representatives, should read the report of the inquest in Carrickmines because it has very far-reaching implications.  We have a responsibility and a duty, as elected public representatives, to represent all people, not just some.  We should look at the recommendations around new fire safety guidelines, fire safety champions, and the positioning of caravans.  We should not just cast it aside because of some people's perceptions of the Travelling community.  Far from it; we should be absolutely adamant in ensuring that the memorial we erect as a legacy arising from the tragedy is that we never have another Carrickmines.  These are human beings and citizens of our country who deserve respect and who deserve to have, and should have, the arms of local government and Government around them.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.  Regarding the matter of the report of the European Committee of Social Rights, I do not have the information about which the Senator spoke but I would be very happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy English, come to the House on that matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the matter of rogue traders and crime.  I concur with her in respect of rogue traders.  There seems to be an epidemic of rogue traders around the country.  I am a member of the joint policing committees of Cork city and Cork county.  We have had reports on that issue.  It is important that people are vigilant.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Equally, it is important to note that the Government is committed to Garda recruitment and has started a process in that regard.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to have 15,000 garda&iacute; by 2021.  Last year the Minister for Justice and Equality put in place a process to recruit 800 new garda&iacute;.  The Garda College in Templemore has been reopened; resources have been increased to the tune of &euro;600 million; while the overtime budget has been increased to &euro;95 million.  The Government is committed to implementing the report on the future of policing.  However, I take Senator Conway-Walsh&rsquo;s point and hope there is greater on-the-beat activity by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I know that in Cork there is a commitment to community policing, with the recruitment of more community garda&iacute;.  While the Government is committed to doing this, it is important that it be recognised that, as citizens, we have a responsibility to report crime and be vigilant.  I know of a number of people who have been the victims of rogue traders, which is both distressing and disturbing.  I will take the matter to the Minister and have him come to the House to discuss it.<\/p><p>Senator Murnane O&rsquo;Connor raised the issue of a safer Internet day.  I hope all Members can play a role in making cyberspace safer and educating people on the issue.  On Monday I attended the launch of the online bystander intervention by Dr. Louise Crowley at University College Cork.  It aims to educate students on sexual and domestic violence prevention, while reducing its prevalence, with unwanted sexual attention.  We all have a role to play in that regard, but information and education are also important.  I will endeavour to arrange the debate in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I join Senator Byrne in congratulating Regeneron on its investment in Limerick and the mid-west.  The new jobs will be welcomed in the area.  I thank all those involved in making this commitment.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the timing of items included in the Order of Business.  From my understanding of the Order of Business today, the debate on No. 4 cannot start until 6.30 p.m.  Accordingly, if No. 5 is to be taken at the conclusion of No. 4, it cannot be taken before 6.30 p.m.  Senator Boyhan made the point that it was his prerogative to oppose the Order of Business.  However, the job of Members is to debate and pass legislation.  Unless we really want to do so, we cannot keep deferring the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill because it is a Member&rsquo;s prerogative to do so.  I saw one anonymous quote from a Senator that it would be a fight to the death.  That does not help.  Every week I come into the House in a spirit of co-operation and endeavour to work with all Members.  However, it our job to pass legislation.  As Senator Conway-Walsh correctly said, some of the behaviour in dealing with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill leaves much to be desired.  It is a poor reflection on this Chamber for those in wider society who are watching or listening to the debate and does not help our cause.  We can disagree on many other points of legislation.  Senator Mullen and I have often disagreed on many issues, but we do not hold up the business of the House.  We engage in a proper process, but that is not happening with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and it is disappointing to see the behaviour of some Members in dealing with it.  We should reflect on our role and the way we do our business.  At one level, Members do not want to use the guillotine or sit late.  When do they want to debate the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill?  Will we absent ourselves because a Member cannot be here?  The Minister was available this week.  If I inconvenienced Members, I apologise.  However, it is my prerogative to change the Order of Business.<\/p><p>As I said yesterday, the only legislation opposed on the Order of Business was the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  All other amendments to the proposed schedule were agreed to.  Some Members made requests to have Ministers attend the House and we will endeavour to facilitate them.  I am embarrassed about Senator Humphreys&rsquo; requests, about which I have spoken to him.  However, I honour commitments insofar as I can.  If I cannot do so, I tell the Senator concerned.  Our job is to debate legislation and we should do so.  If we oppose a Bill, that is fine.  However, we cannot hold it up indeterminably.  In a previous Seanad the Cathaoirleach had the pleasure of debating the Harbours Bill, but he did not keep the debate going until the end of days.  Instead, he let it go after a while.  We need to get real about how we do our business.  If Senator Boyhan has a difficulty with the times at which business is taken, he can talk to me about it and I will endeavour to work on it.  I apologise if Members felt I discommoded them yesterday.  However, I have an obligation on behalf of the Government to have legislation debated, passed and enacted.  I will always work in a spirit of co-operation.  Sometimes, however, we enter a cul-de-sac and there is no reciprocation.<\/p><p>Senators Mulherin and Feighan raised the important issue of tourism.  I congratulate all those involved in doubling the number of visitors from North America in the past five years.  Tourist numbers have broken the 10 million barrier for the first time.  What is most welcome is the increase in business from North America, while European tourist figures are up by 9.5%.  What is disappointing and a source of concern is that British visitor numbers increased by only 1%.  It is important to recognise that the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, is willing to debate the matter in the House.<\/p><p>I join Senators Higgins and Black in welcoming the celebration of Luke Kelly&rsquo;s life.  I hope it will be a wonderful day.<\/p><p>Senator Swanick raised the important matter of sepsis.  I agree with him on the need for an information campaign.  I extend my sympathy to the families of those who died from sepsis to whom the Senator referred.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard referred to delays in Cork due to snow.  I know that on Carrs Hill and Maryborough Hill there were unacceptable delays of two and a half hours for commuters.  I have been told by Cork County Council that at 8 p.m. last night and 4 a.m. today its staff were gritting the main routes.  Met &Eacute;ireann issued a yellow warning alert for the Cork area.  However, it is disappointing to hear that commuters were stuck in cars for two and a half hours.  It is unacceptable that they were delayed for so long, given that the county council was forewarned.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred to the cost implications of the GDPR for small businesses.  In some cases, it has added extraordinary costs for businesses.

The Bill has passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and obtained cross-party support.  The purpose of this Bill is to update and modernise Irish law relating to hallmarking.  Hallmarking describes the administrative and legal system for ensuring that articles of precious metals conform to legal standards as to the fineness of the precious metals, and is one of the earliest examples of consumer protection legislation in Ireland.  The legislation goes back to 1637 and provides that no article made from named precious metals can be sold in Ireland without it being assayed and hallmarked.<\/p> <p>Currently the primary legislation dealing with hallmarking in Ireland is the Hallmarking Act 1981 and it covers articles made from gold, silver or platinum or alloys of gold, silver or platinum.  Such precious metal articles must bear either an Irish hallmark, a hallmark of the international hallmarking Convention on the Control and Marking of Articles of Precious Metals, of which Ireland is a member, or an approved hallmark from an EU member state in order that they can be legally offered for sale in this country.<\/p> <p>In addition to hallmarks, articles of precious metals commonly bear a sponsor&rsquo;s mark.  This identifies the person who submits the article for hallmarking, that is, the person who made the article or who worked it into its finished state, or a dealer.  As a result, the owner of an article can identify not just the fineness of the metal and the assay office that determined it, but also the provenance of the article.  The Company of Goldsmiths of Dublin oversees the Dublin Assay Office, which is situated in Dublin Castle.  The Irish Assay Office is an independent, self-funding, third party State-appointed test laboratory which assays and hallmarks items of gold, silver and platinum jewellery and plate articles, either manufactured in Ireland or imported.  The mark of the Assay Office is the indication that the precious metal conforms to a certain standard of fineness and, therefore, assures the consumer that an article that states it is pure gold actually is pure gold.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the great work done by the Assay Office.  This was also recognised in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by colleagues across the floor of the House.<\/p> <p>Since the current legislation was introduced in 1981, there have been advances in the jewellery trade.  Palladium has been recognised as a precious metal and there has been an increase in the production of jewellery made of mixed precious metals and of a combination of both precious metal and non-precious metal.  Under current legislation the Assay Office cannot legally hallmark palladium or articles made from mixed precious metals or multi-metal articles as the 1981 Act does not provide for this.  The introduction of new Irish hallmarks to cover these new jewellery items would provide effective protection for consumers, increase consumer confidence in the fineness of the precious metal article and promote trade and economic activity for Ireland.<\/p> <p>In recent times, there has been a trend towards assay offices in other jurisdictions to either open assay offices outside their countries of establishment or to place officials in factories abroad, in order to assay and mark articles of precious metals on site.  This practice has been made for good business reasons, since it is easier for a manufacturer if the testing and marking is done in the factory where the product is made since the delivery time is shortened and the product can be packed for retail display at source.  Compliance is also facilitated by having the testing and marking done before products leave the factory.  The UK and the Netherlands have already chosen to take this route.  In order to have the possibility to engage in such offshore assaying, were it to choose to so do in the future, the Assay Office made a request to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to amend the Hallmarking Act 1981 to legislate for such a provision.  While it is my understanding that the need for such offshore marking is not currently required and that the Assay Office does not intend engaging in such activity in the near future, legislating for the possibility at this stage is seen as a prudent way of ensuring that the facility is open to it, if required.  The Dublin Assay Office would be required to seek approval from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation before any such offshore activity by the Assay Office could take place under the Bill.  The same prudent approach lies behind the proposed provision allowing for the possibility of the Irish Assay Office entering into an arrangement with another assay office to hallmark precious metals.  For example, such a scenario might arise where the volume of articles of a specific precious metal might not justify expenditure on the assaying equipment for that metal by the Dublin Assay Office.<\/p> <p>As the Bill is a technical measure, consultation with the European Commission and all other EU member states was required under EU law.  No submissions were received from parties in other member states or from the Commission.  I now wish to turn to the provisions of the Bill and briefly explain what each is designed to achieve.  Sections 1 and 17, providing for definitions and Short Title and commencement, respectively, of the Bill are standard legislative provisions while sections 2 to 16, inclusive, are the core provisions of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Section 2 provides for amendments to section 1 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by making consequential amendments to that Act&rsquo;s definitions.  Section 3 provides for an amendment to section 2 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 to enable the Assay Office, if it is approved to engage in offshore marking, to strike hallmarks outside the State and for articles bearing those hallmarks to be treated in the same way as articles bearing hallmarks struck in the State.  Section 4 provides for an amendment to section 3 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 to allow for the making of regulations to prescribe different marks for hallmarks applied in Ireland and for those applied offshore.<\/p> <p>Section 5 provides for a technical amendment to section 4 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 in relation to forged hallmarks.  Section 6 provides for the addition of three new sections to the Hallmarking Act 1981 to allow offshore hallmarking to take place if the Irish Assay Office chooses, at some time in the future, to engage in such activity.<\/p> <p>Section 7 provides for a technical amendment to section 5(1) of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by adding palladium to the list of articles of precious metals for which it is an offence to apply a false trade description.  Section 8 provides for a technical amendment to section 6(2) of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by adding palladium to the list of articles of precious metals qualified by the word \"plated\".  Section 9 inserts new sections 6B and 6C into the Hallmarking Act 1981 to allow for the hallmarking of multi-metal articles.  Section 10 provides for a technical amendment to section 8 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by adding palladium to the list of articles of precious metals to ensure that every reference to gold or silver in an enactment specified in subsection (2) shall be construed as including a reference to palladium.  Platinum has already been included in the definition in the 1981 Act.<\/p> <p>Section 11 provides for an amendment to section 9 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 to allow the Irish Assay Office and a sponsor to make arrangements for the sponsor&rsquo;s mark to be struck by the assay master or an authorised assay office in accordance with section 6 of this Bill.  Section 12 provides for an amendment to section 12 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 to ensure that, in the case of additions to existing articles of precious metal, the added metal is of the same precious metal as the existing article.  It also provides technical amendments to definitions and provisions of offences for such cases.  Section 13 provides for the inclusion of provisions on offences and penalties related to forged hallmarks.  Section 14 provides for the inclusion of provisions to take account of offences by a body corporate.<\/p> <p>Section 15 provides for an amendment to section 14 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by providing for the Irish Assay Office to make charges, with the consent of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, for hallmarks applied in any offshore assay offices it establishes under section 6 of this Bill in the same way it currently does for hallmarking in its Dublin office.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 16<b><\/b>is a standard repeals provision and provides for the repeal of sections of the Plate Assay (Ireland) Act 1807 and section 13 of the Hallmarking Act 1981, both of whose subject matter are now covered by section 13 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Jewellery is often an expensive commodity in the lives of consumers, particularly when people are buying engagement or wedding rings, for example.

Fianna F&aacute;il certainly supports the general principles of the Hallmarking (Amendment) Bill 2016 and will support its passage to the next Stage.  Hallmarking involves putting official marks or a series of marks on precious metals such as gold and silver to ensure that such metals conform to permissible standards of fineness of precious metals.  The Bill also provides for the assaying and hallmarking in certain circumstances of articles of precious metals outside the State.  In general, these legislative changes strengthen the regulation of hallmarking, which benefits consumers as it assures buyers of the standard of the materials used in these articles.  Ensuring, through quality assurance, that these metals and materials are of certain quality increases consumer protection in this area.  It gives a certain assurance and guarantee to customers that they are buying what they think they are buying.  That is the most important part of the Bill.  On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I am delighted to commend the proposed changes and general purpose of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#Q00300","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Bill is technical in nature.  However, hallmarking is a very important process and it has been very interesting to learn more about it.  Hallmarking is one of the oldest forms of consumer protection, and has existed in Ireland since 1637.  As we know, the current laws on hallmarking require all goods of gold, silver and platinum to bear a defined distinct mark, a pressed stamp on a piece of jewellery, or a hallmark, before they can be legally offered for sale.<\/p><p>The Hallmarking (Amendment) Bill 2016<i><\/i>proposes amendments to the Hallmarking Act 1981<i><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/i>that will give effect to three main proposals.  The first is to add palladium, alongside gold, silver and platinum, as a precious metal that comes under the State&rsquo;s hallmarking regime.  The proposal to add palladium to the State&rsquo;s hallmarking regime reflects the increasing popularity of that metal in domestic and international markets.  The second proposal is to enable the Company of Goldsmiths of Dublin, which oversees the Assay Office in Dublin, to open assay offices outside the State where articles can be assayed by the company and have Irish hallmarks applied to them.  The company is also to have power to enter into agreements with certain other offshore assay offices allowing them to assay articles and strike Irish hallmarks on them on the company&rsquo;s behalf.  My colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, visited the Assay Office in Dublin Castle and was highly impressed with its set-up and with the expertise of its staff.  He told me it is a very impressive, effective organisation staffed by people who have a deep desire to ensure customers are protected and Irish jewellery retains its very high reputation for quality.  The third consequence of the Bill is to create new offences of applying forged hallmarks and of selling articles that bear them.  This is an important layer of protection for those in this industry.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill as it will bring Ireland into line with other countries and give assurance to buyers of the quality of Irish-made palladium jewellery.  Most jewellery representative groups were happy with the provisions of the Bill while just one group wanted weight exemptions included.  After our own research and consultation with representative bodies, we concluded that no amendments for weight exemptions should be introduced so as to ensure the high quality of Irish products is maintained and to protect consumers.  Therefore, we are happy to support the Bill in its current form.  The addition will bring Ireland into line with other signatories of the 1972 Hallmarking Convention and will give Irish buyers articles made with the quality assurance of an Irish hallmark.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  I thank the staff of the Assay Office for their important work in this area.  The Irish Assay Office has been in operation for the past 381 years.  I hope the changes contained in the Bill will continue to help protect the high quality of Irish jewellery for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#Q00400","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I will bear in mind the Acting Chairman's comment that ten minutes is a maximum, not a target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#Q00500","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>It has worked so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#Q00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I would like to continue in that fashion.

I would like to comment on hallmarking as a consumer issue.  It is very important that people are protected, get what they are paying for and can be assured that there is a standard ensuring that what they are purchasing is what it purports to be and will stand the test of time.  The Minister is absolutely right that Ireland is full of the history of wedding rings being handed down through the generations.

Currently there is a two-step procedure for a company in filing an annual return with the Companies Registration Office.  First, file the annual return 28 days after its filing deadline.  Second, a further 28 days are allowed to complete its filing by uploading its financial statements and submitting a completed signature page.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will amend sections 343(2) and 343(3) of the Companies Act 2014 to amalgamate the two-step process and provide companies with a one-step 56 day period to complete the process of filing an annual return.  This amendment will allow more time for filing the annual return and removes an administrative burden on companies by simplifying procedures in filing, making it easier for companies to meet their filing deadlines.<br\/><br\/>It is important to remember the purpose of asking companies to file annual reports.  This is done because public filing by companies is an essential protection for other companies, suppliers and employees who rely on meaningful financial information.  The <i>quid pro quo<\/i>is that when it comes to filing annual returns and financial statements, we must make it as straightforward as possible for companies.  The law already allows companies up to 11 months to prepare and file financial statements.  In 2017, we legislated to simplify and reduce the content of those financial statements for small and micro-sized companies.  This year, the Companies Registration Office is upgrading its IT system to make it even easier for all companies to file on time by moving to a process that can be done in a single step and entirely online.<br\/><br\/>The amendment contained in this Bill is the last piece of the legislative framework to support this simplified process.  This will deliver a more efficient system for all companies filing annual returns.  The early enactment of this Bill will allow time for the CRO to make all companies aware, in advance of the new procedures and the IT upgrade.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#Q01700","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for an equally comprehensive opening statement on this relatively simple and straightforward legislation.

It is a very important time to discuss the issue at the beginning of 2019.  Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's action plan to deal with every aspect of the housing crisis that we face, has been in effect since the middle of 2016 and will last until 2021.  This is an important year for the plan in continuing to provide for delivery and put in place supports for those who need our help.  Many things need to be done as part of the plan because there are many aspects to the challenges we face in housing provision.  We are rebuilding a housing sector that was broken at every part of the supply and construction chain.  We are building it in a way that it will not be like what it was before but in a way that will protect and future-proof the sector from future shocks.<\/p> <p>The most distressing aspect of the challenge we face is the damage being done to people living in emergency accommodation.  Damage is being done to society and individuals and their families because they have to spend time in emergency accommodation.  There are too many living in emergency accommodation.  It is absolutely unacceptable that people still have to go to hotels for emergency accommodation.  The whole purpose of Rebuilding Ireland is to bring about political and policy change and actual meaningful change on the ground in order that emergency accommodation will only ever be a very short-term response, family hubs are a first response and that no family will find themselves in emergency accommodation.  Because of the housing shortage, we do have this today, but we are trying to correct the shortage as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>When we talk about solutions, whether for the elderly, those in emergency accommodation, persons who are paying too much in rent, young families and young couples who cannot afford to buy a home, there is no point in discussing any of these areas unless look, first and foremost, at the fundamental issue of supply.  Before we talk about whether we should be using the housing assistance payment, HAP, to the degree we are, whether we are building enough social housing, whether we can bring forward cost rental quickly enough, when or how we should reform the rental sector, the use of hotels for those living in emergency accommodation, the right price of a home or the affordability challenge, we have to make sure new homes are being built.  That is very important.  We have to ensure, two and a half years into Rebuilding Ireland, it is correcting the fundamental problem in supply and the short answer is that it is.  The fundamental problem of supply is being corrected very quickly.  We are still awaiting confirmation of the numbers for 2018 in the CSO's new build numbers which we did not have at the beginning of Rebuilding Ireland but which we will because we had that piece of work done with the CSO.  We will have the figures in the coming weeks.  We will also have the figures from local authorities for the increases in the numbers of homes in the stock of social housing.  We will have both numbers in February and I expect them to confirm that there was quite a dramatic increase in the supply of new builds during the course of 2018.  A recent report from Goodbody, based on its tracker, shows that about 18,500 new homes were built during the course of 2018.  If that is true, it is the highest number of new builds in nine years.  That is not to be dismissed; it is very important.  <\/p> <p>The fundamental problem needs to be addressed if we are to look properly at things surrounding affordability, the cost of rent, getting people out of emergency accommodation and building enough social housing.  If the delivery last year was between 18,000 and 20,000, as the Government was targeting, what I expect when I receive confirmation from the local authorities is that between one in four or five of the newly built homes was social housing.  When was the last time the State did this?  It is definitely more than a decade, if not two decades, ago.  It is very important to recognise that fact, but is it enough?  No, not yet.  However, it is making a significant difference.<\/p> <p>The other indicators we have such as the numbers of planning permissions and commencement notices indicate that what happened in 2018 was not a once-off.  In 2019 the number of new homes built will be even higher again.  The number of social houses delivered will also be higher again this year.  The increase in supply is having a very real and meaningful impact in a number of ways.  As reported on recently, the rate of growth in house prices is falling.  In 2018 there was single digit growth, which was very welcome.  This year the rate will be lower still.<\/p> <p>The other tangible way it has an impact on people's lives is when those individuals living in emergency accommodation move into new homes and get the key to the front door.  When I was in County Donegal recently, I had the opportunity to meet families who had moved from emergency accommodation, the rental sector or the housing list or who had been living in overcrowded accommodation.  Just before Christmas they had received the keys to their new houses.  In the first or second week of January I visited and already it was their home.  They had their furniture and pictures on the fridge.  They had made it their own place and had that warmth and security from which they could build a life, think about the future and their kids.  They were so happy to be there.  Others were just getting the keys and about to move in, but they were already thinking about what they should bring into the kitchen and type of furniture they might want to have in their home.  It was all very exciting for them.  If we keep the people we are trying to help at the centre of our focus, we will be able to deliver the right solutions in the right way for them, solutions that will last.  The worst thing we could do would be to offer solutions, homes to people, in an imprudent or unsustainable way and then find them back in a precarious position or others in an even more precarious position in the future.  We have a responsibility to do this in the right way.  That is happening but not quickly enough, which is why I have to continue to drive and monitor Rebuilding Ireland, reform or change it, where needed, and maintain it as a priority for the Government.  <\/p> <p>On emergency accommodation, we are enduring a period of cold weather, with very low temperatures.  The cold weather initiative is in effect.  Some have been saying incorrectly that people have been turned away from shelters, but that is not the case.  There is sufficient capacity in the system and we have extra outreach teams out.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some accommodation is not suitable to remain open during the daytime.  Where that is the case, we transition people into day care centres and places where they do not have to be out in the cold during the day.  It is important to do this because it is a vulnerable time when we have cold weather like we have now.  Homelessness, when it comes to individual adults, is complex.  Even when we have the worst weather imaginable such as Storm Emma, some people will still refuse to come inside.  We will not stop going out with our outreach teams to help them because it is a priority for us to keep them safe at such a time.<\/p><p>The emergency accommodation numbers for December will be released later today and what we will see is that there has been a reduction, which is welcome.  It would have been anticipated to a degree because it was the month of December.  We will also see a decrease in the number of presentations and an increase in the number of adults because of the new beds we have brought into the system.  While no increase is welcome, the people in question are now in the system, off the streets and receiving the care they need.  We need to transition them into sustainable accommodation where they can be safe and secure.  The overall number living in emergency accommodation is down, which is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The Government priority is the provision of housing.  Everything we do must have a tangible impact on people who are experiencing difficulties, be it high rent, homelessness, living in emergency accommodation or housing insecurity.  Up to &euro;2.4 billion will be spent this year on housing.  That is the most money a Government has ever spent in a single year on housing and it will be put into helping people into new social housing.  We expect the 2018 social housing figure to show an increase in stock eight times what it was 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland was launched.  We have our hub programme which is looking after more than 500 families.  On average, families are waiting about six months before we get them into a home, but they have all the care and support they need.  We have teams regularly sourcing accommodation to ensure people can get out emergency accommodation quickly and sustainably.<\/p><p>I talked about some of the families I met recently in County Donegal and the good work happening there.  It is happening all over the country.  I thank local authorities, housing bodies and all our partner NGOs which are doing much work in this area with the Government and taxpayers&rsquo; money to help people.  During the course of last year more than 25,000 tenancies were secured.  Social housing solutions will have been reached thanks to taxpayer support and because it is a Government priority.  However, while we continue to see landlords exiting the market, we will continue to have people presenting to emergency accommodation services, even though the social housing stock is increasing.  That is why reforming the rental sector is so important.  We know that rent controls are working from the data in the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, Q3 report.  However, we also know that they are not working evenly across rent control areas.  I have legislation to strengthen enforcement of rent controls in rent pressure zones to protect renters.  It will ensure there is a longer notice to quit period which will effectively be doubled to give people more time to source new accommodation.  It will put in place a rent register to ensure rent transparency and that people know what a fair rent is, as well as addressing student rents and other issues.<\/p><p>In this year&rsquo;s budget we increased mortgage interest relief for landlords to 100% because we need them.  We cannot force people to be landlords, but we need them providing the service.  We have to ensure that in everything we do, we avoid unintended consequences and strike a balance.  How can we protect tenants further, while also ensuring we have landlords offering homes as accommodation?  We know that we do not have the typical rental market one has in other European countries.  We know that we are an outlier in that regard because 86% of landlords own only one or two properties.  Many of them are accidental landlords because we are still dealing with legacy issues dating from the financial crash.  As we approach this issue, we have to bear in mind that we must keep potential unintended consequences in mind, while trying to strike a balance for both.  That is why we are reforming the rental sector and giving increased resources to the RTB.  Increasing its budget for this year by 67% is all part of the change management programme to make it a more robust regulator for landlord and tenant alike in the rental sector.  We also want to see a cost rental sector.  Last night in Inchicore I met the consultative group for the St. Michael&rsquo;s regeneration effort which has proposed a pilot project for a cost rental model for the first time.  The model makes up 20% to 25% of housing in other European cities and provides security in renting.  It shows the cost of rent in the coming five to ten-year time horizon and longer.  We are working on it and I thank the consultative forum which is important for engaging positively last night.<\/p><p>We know that we have to address the issue of short-term lets in the rental sector.  From 1 June there will be big changes in this area.  We support home sharing when it means just that.  If it is a primary residence, one can continue to let a room to tourists.  Alternatively, one can let one&rsquo;s entire home to tourists, provided it is for less than the 90-day cap.  However, if it is a second, investment or rental property in a high-demand area, it can no longer be used as a short-term let.  It has to be used for people who are living and working in the area.  That is what we deem to be the most appropriate use of the housing stock, particularly at a time when there is a shortage of housing.  Obviously, carve-outs have been made for holiday homes.  In many parts of the country home sharing makes a fantastic contribution to the tourism sector.  The same can be said of executive lets.  Where people are coming to work for longer periods, it is important that we have such facilities.<\/p><p>Affordability will be a key challenge for us.  We saw how the rate of house price inflation has come down to single figures in 2018.  It will come down again this year.  The rate of rent inflation has also come down in rent pressure zones where it is working.  In the 12 months to October last year, there were more than 50,000 house transactions.  One in two of these homes was sold for less than &euro;250,000.  That tells us that affordability is a challenge, but in parts of the country only.  In other parts the affordability challenge might actually be more on the builder&rsquo;s side in being able to obtain the necessary finance.  That is why the Minister for Finance and I launched Home Building Finance Ireland earlier this week.  It will ensure homes can be built in communities where there is demand and affordability is not necessarily a challenge on the buying side. <\/p><p>Home ownership should be an aspiration for everyone.  If it is the choice people want to make, we have to tackle the affordability challenge.  How do we do it?  We should use public money to open up private and public land.  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will provide &euro;200 million to provide 20,000 new homes, the majority of which will be social housing, affordable purchase and cost rental homes or eligible for a cost-related deduction because of the public investment made.  There is the help to buy scheme which has helped over 8,000 families and individuals to put together the deposit to buy a new home.  Rebuilding Ireland is not even a year old, yet half of the money made available for it has been drawn down.  It is a three-year programme.  In the first 10 months half of the funding has been drawn down by people to buy homes.  We have the serviced sites fund, the largest affordability package introduced by a Government in over a decade which comes to &euro;310 million.  The first sites, worth &euro;43 million, have been identified for the delivery of homes in 2020.  The second call will be made to local authorities shortly.<\/p><p>The first board meeting of the Land Development Agency was held on Monday.  The agency will bring forward sites in high-demand areas where there are already large State sites which are not being used efficiently.  The first eight have been identified.  We believe the appropriate use of public lands for the public good is to provide homes for everybody, as well as social and affordable homes that can be sold to people who cannot avail of subsidised housing schemes.  At least 40% of homes on these lands will either be delivered through social housing or subsidised schemes.  That will make a real impact, not just for the people who will get to live in these homes but also in moderating house prices in these areas.<\/p><p>This year we will put fewer people into homes using the housing assistance payment than we did last year because we are building more social housing.  In 2021, the last year of Rebuilding Ireland, we will be accommodating more people in homes that will be part of a stock of social housing than we will be in the rental sector through the housing assistance payment.  It is important that we achieve that rebalance in the life cycle of Rebuilding Ireland and drive it beyond it.  The ideal is to have one in four or five homes built as social housing.  That will help people on housing waiting lists and those who need our help the most.  That is important, but it takes a little longer and can be more expensive.  We must make sure we do not build sprawling housing estates without the schools, roads and community facilities they need.  We must provide these in time together to ensure we will not strand communities.  We have to make sure we are providing mixed developments.  We want to use housing policy to support, not divide, communities.  That is a key driver of Rebuilding Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have made other reforms, such as of apartment guidelines to encourage a greater build-to-rent sector and make it more viable to build apartments by examining the number of units per core and the need for car-parking spaces to increase densities.  We have also addressed lifting the height caps.<\/p><p>We have begun to reform transport infrastructure in large towns and urban centres because it does not make sense any more for sustainable and high-quality living.  We are ensuring that we have a fast-track process for planning, cutting red tape where we can to build larger sites more quickly and reducing our own approval process by cutting red tape in the Custom House.  The four-stage process has been reduced to 59 weeks.  We are also examining how we can reform the one-stage process in order that more housing programmes can be covered by that process, which is quicker than the four-stage process.  There is also a new housing delivery office in the Department and the work that the Minister of State, Deputy English, is doing with that office is important.  <\/p><p>There are vacancy teams in each local authority.  Although we know vacancy is not the low-hanging fruit which we initially thought it was, we are taking in homes through the repair and leasing scheme, which has been reformed, and the buy and renew scheme.  We have changed planning regulations for promoting above-the-shop living and there is the urban regeneration fund.  Some &euro;3 billion will be spent over the next ten years to ensure that as we build, we build sustainably in the right locations, thinking of the future in terms of climate change, transport times, commuting times, quality of life and people's health.  As we build houses, we must ensure we build communities, places and homes, which is what we ultimately want to do and achieve but it was not always done before.  <\/p><p>We have never really had a properly functioning housing sector, either because not enough social housing homes were built directly by the State, there was not enough supply, there was too much supply or supply in the wrong places, or rents and the cost of a house have been too high.  All these problems have happened before and we have moved in cycles.  We are now trying to break those cycles once and for all, which is at the heart of Rebuilding Ireland.  While we have more to do, there are three years remaining in Rebuilding Ireland and my responsibility is to drive the plan to its conclusion and take all the additional steps we need to take, ensuring we are always driving delivery because without that, we cannot talk about any of the other solutions we need.<\/p><p>I thank Members of the Oireachtas for their input to date.  Rebuilding Ireland was shaped in large part by the work done, when the current D&aacute;il was formed, by the committee drawn from both Houses of the Oireachtas on the steps we needed to take.  We have built off the back of that good work to build the Government programme and planned beyond it, through Project Ireland 2040, to ensure that as Rebuilding Ireland concludes, a new programme will continue the strong parts of Rebuilding Ireland that have been shown to work well.  <\/p><p>I look forward to the contributions from Senators and I welcome every contribution.  Rebuilding Ireland is a plan that is working but parts of it are not working as well as they should be.  If people have ideas about where we can make improvements, I will listen and bring about those changes where I can, notwithstanding that we need to be conscious of unintended consequences or that we need to ensure that at the heart of everything we do, we help first and foremost those who are most vulnerable, in the best way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#Z00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his report.  It is no secret that we are in the worst of times.  Chaos and uncertainty loom next month because of Brexit, members of the health sector are taking to the streets and people are dying in our towns and cities.  Last week, another homeless man was found dead in a derelict building in my county.  My heart breaks for his family, to whom I send my deepest condolences, and I am sorry for the families we have let down over and over again.  We ought to hang our heads in shame that we stand here while thousands live in fear of another day in homelessness.  While we are all working hard, there need to be more resources and commitment because something must be done.<\/p> <p>Fine Gael has overseen a crisis of unprecedented numbers of people without homes, rents surging to historic heights, home-building numbers tens of thousands behind where they need to be, and 130,000 people in need of a permanent social home.  All the while, another significant problem is emerging, namely, the Government has completely ignored the ordinary worker who cannot afford a place to own.  Fianna F&aacute;il has made significant progress in budget 2019 but the key is delivery.  Since coming into power, Fine Gael has launched Construction 2020, Social Housing Strategy 2020, the Rebuilding Ireland action plan of 2016 and capital plans in 2012, 2015 and 2018.  These separate plans exclude the numerous relaunches involved, which is more launches than homes built by local authorities in certain areas.  I raise the issue because I have previously raised it with the Minister.  The year is 2019, and we need to ensure that Rebuilding Ireland works, through its five pillars on which we all have worked so hard.  We do not need any more launches of plans; we need to ensure we get delivery.  People are sick and tired of promises because promises are broken, patched up, reworded, and broken again.  <\/p> <p>Last week, a woman visiting my clinic told me Irish Water wrote to her asking why she was using many gallons more water than a household of its size should.  She replied that five adults in their 30s are back living at home with her because they have no other option as rents in Carlow cost almost &euro;1,000 a month.  She also has two grandchildren living with her and the house is very crowded.  Her children are on the housing list but have been overlooked time and again and they cannot afford to get their own mortgage because house prices have risen to unaffordable levels.  Figures given to us at one of our recent housing meetings suggested that the average rent in Carlow was &euro;750 a month but it is actually &euro;1,000 a month.  The figures that are being given to the Department are so far off the mark that they are causing serious issues for people who are trying to rent a property.  In December, I called for a timeline on a review of social housing income thresholds, but I have yet to receive any correspondence on the issue.  We are unwittingly excluding people who should genuinely qualify for social housing.  <\/p> <p>A family recently came to me for help.  They were bringing home between &euro;350 and &euro;400 per week but did not qualify to be registered on Carlow County Council's housing list as they were earning over the income threshold, which is one of the lowest in the country at &euro;27,500.  Our neighbouring counties' thresholds are between &euro;32,500 and &euro;34,000, which is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that people who work to try to make ends meet are told they do not qualify for the housing waiting lists.  I have raised the issue consistently and been told it was being examined, but people in Carlow and, I am sure, other counties with low caps are caught in limbo because they do not qualify under the social housing income threshold but do not earn enough to afford a mortgage.  They need answers as much as I do.  Seven years have passed since the last review of the cap to qualify for local authority housing lists, which is unacceptable.  I understand that a new assessment was due last summer, and there is an urgent need to finalise the review and increase the income eligibility limits for social housing in Carlow and most likely in other counties.  It is extraordinary that in the midst of a housing crisis, the Government is denying accessing rent allowance and the housing assistance payment from many families who are under intense financial pressure.<\/p> <p>I do not mean to repeat myself but we are in an emergency.  We need to consider the levels of unsustainable rents, people not qualifying for the local authority housing lists and people being unable to get a mortgage.  The Minister spoke about mortgages, and I acknowledge there has been an increase in the threshold for mortgages, but it remains hard to qualify and the matter needs to be re-examined.  Even if one is a first-time buyer, one must have enough savings for a 10% deposit.  Many people who come to my clinics do not qualify to go on the local authority list and, therefore, they pay &euro;1,000 a month in rent and cannot save.  They fall between the social housing income threshold and earning enough to afford a mortgage.  They are the hidden figures that are not accounted for.  We need to seriously examine the matter.  <\/p> <p>Homelessness figures remain far too high and thousands of children are being scarred by the experience.  The dispute over the exact number misses the point of the unacceptable scale of the problem.  The Temple Street Hospital figures underline the scale and horror of the problem, but that is just one example.  Many of the Department's figures, such as those for housing, homelessness or the number of people not qualifying for the housing lists, are utterly wrong.  <\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has shown it is committed to finding meaningful solutions to our role in the confidence and supply agreement, and has not shirked leading criticism of the Government where it is at fault.  Homeownership is slipping away from an entire generation as housing prices rise by 13% per annum, whereas wages rise by only 2.5%.  The rate of homeownership, at 68%, is at the lowest since 1971, while some households are one pay cheque away from living on the street, which we must admit.  Some households have lost homes, family members, marriages or children through the crisis but I do not believe the Minister does not understand what is happening, in particular to families crying out for help.  Only &euro;20 million was allocated to the affordable housing scheme in 2018, with no units delivered or regulations even signed off on.  We produced a revamped scheme worth more than &euro;100 million per annum over the next three years, which will deliver approximately 7,500 units at an average price of &euro;200,000 for ordinary-income workers.  There are too many workers who need to be able to access the market.  They need an end in sight for all their hard work and we cannot be seen to help only the helpless.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to help those who can help themselves but need access to affordable homes to do so.

Local authorities would then take out a loan from the Housing Finance Agency to build the units, with a further average &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 subsidy per home directly from the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>I have raised concerns about the housing assistance payment many times with the Minister.  Today he spoke about rent pressure zones and I have massive issues with them.  They are only in certain areas.  Carlow does not qualify for a rent pressure zone.  The Minister needs to examine all local authorities.  It is unfair that we have neighbouring counties, such as Wicklow, that qualify as rent pressure zones.  It is unfair on people living in the area that they are not given this opportunity.  We also need to look at stability.<\/p> <p>I am aware women's refuges are not under the remit of the Minister and they are more a matter for Tusla and the Department of Health but the Minister's Department needs to step in and examine what we are doing to help women's refuges.  We are crying out for women's refuges in Carlow.  On several occasions, I have made attempts to get funding for them.  They used to fall within the ambit of the Department with responsibility for housing but were moved a few years ago.  They need to go back to that Department.  Every town in Ireland should have a women's refuge.  It is very hard when I have women and families coming to me but I have nowhere to send them because Carlow does not have a women's refuge.  The nearest is in Kilkenny but it is always full and Waterford is the next nearest.<\/p> <p>People are living longer and the Minister spoke about quality of life.  We need to consider housing for people with disabilities and older people.  We need to consider putting more money into extensions for these people.  Recently, much of my time has been spent trying to get bathroom adaptation grants, window and doors.  We need to look more at these issues because we need to put more funding into them.  Often, we take measures that seem to be solutions but they do not work.  We need to speak about what is being built in Ireland and address the issue of building units that serve only one type of family.  It is causing a massive issue in the system and it should be addressed properly.  We need brave ideas and action on this.<\/p> <p>I believe the Minister has made progress.  He has definitely bought and built houses but while he has gone from one stage to another there are people in between who do not make local authority housing lists and are trying to buy houses.  There are also homeless people with no security and people such as the man who died in Carlow last week in a derelict building because it was the only place he could go.  That is unacceptable.  We need to ensure we do not lose another life.  It is important that the Minister addresses this.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#CC00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister.  I want to start by thanking some people because sometimes we get lost in all of the controversies and setbacks on housing.  I thank the chief executives of the local authorities, some of whom are watching.  Two or three days ago I made a request of them by email and I can happily tell the House that 26 of the chief executives wrote back with data.  This is positive and would not have happened a few months ago.  In the email I stated the Minister was coming to the Seanad today and I am sure that helped things along.  It is interesting that they are engaging.  If ever housing is discussed in the Seanad or by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government I always make a point of contacting stakeholders, such as the chief executives of the local authorities, the directors of housing and local authority members.  I send them the live link because it is important that they know what we are doing.  They will not hear it from anyone else.  They can see it themselves if they wish and many of them tune in.<\/p> <p>I also acknowledge the Minister's staff.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, as is Senator Murnane O'Connor, and we have a good strong working relationship with the Department.  It is robust from time to time, but anyone who tunes in knows it is a very constructive committee that works well with the departmental officials.  The Minister will vouch for this himself.<\/p> <p>The time has come to have an independent correlation of all of the statistics.  There is so much media spin about what are the issues, what the Department states and what someone else states, and it is about time we had more updated facts on waiting times, housing delivery and a range of issues.  I want to share some information I received because it is interesting.  Today, in Cork City Council's area 3,590 people are on the social housing list and 89 adults and 89 children are in emergency accommodation.  For Dublin City Council, the figures are 17,445 people on the housing list with 2,428 people homeless.  For D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council the figures are 4,524 people on the social housing list and 260 people registered as homeless.  I could go on.  We expect the numbers in these areas to be high.  In Waterford 1,117 people are on the housing list, 1,830 people are in receipt of the housing assistance payment and 135 people are in emergency accommodation.  It is important to get a sense of perspective on what the issues are.  Let us see if we can look again at how we control the data so we can centralise it and have accurate data that has integrity.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister outline why we see less output in terms of the delivery of public housing on public land?  I advocate public housing.  I do not have a hang-up about who builds houses or where they are built but it is important we have good quality public housing, with social housing on social land.  Throughout the country we have land that is not being used for the delivery of social housing.  It is time to have an inventory of our State lands.  I know the Minister is doing this.  Recently, I had a very interesting experience regarding a property I acquired.  I went to the Land Registry and other Departments to do land searches and learned an awful lot about land.  I happened to meet an agent representing CI&Eacute;.  I did not tell him who I was but I went out a lot wiser having spent half an hour with him.  I asked him why he was there and he told me.  I was encouraged by the fact he was doing an inventory of lands to make a more detailed return to some Departments.  It encouraged me.  There is a real need to look at the inventory of land.  We have land in the ownership of State port companies throughout the country.  We also have local authority lands.  From my experience of interfacing with a number of local authorities I know they simply do not know themselves their inventory of lands.  I know from looking at all 31 of the local government audit reports for 2017 that the auditors in the Department's local government auditing service in the Custom House have asked local authority chief executives to provide them with more detail on their property assets register.  These are important connections that feed into housing and where we can get land.<\/p> <p>We clearly need to roll out more public housing.  We also need private housing and affordable housing.  The Minister represents a Dublin constituency.  Working couples in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, South Dublin, Fingal and Dublin city cannot afford to live there.  People are now looking for jobs far outside the city to try to match work with their ability to pay for accommodation.  This is not sustainable or satisfactory.  This is an issue.  I know the Minister knows all of this but I want to reiterate the points because they are important.<\/p> <p>If the Minister has time, I would like to hear where we will go on Shanganagh Castle in Shankill.  It is on State lands and its disposal was authorised by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Senator Michael McDowell.  That is going back some time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are sitting in the ownership of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  I acknowledge we are at a relatively advanced stage but every time I ask where we are in relation to them, no one seems to be able to tell me.  It is not acceptable that we should have to wait another year, possibly two years, before we see building on that land.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister to share some detail on the Central Mental Hospital - a very substantial piece of State land - and what might happen there.  I would like, if possible at this juncture, for the Minister to talk about Thornton Hall.  Can we get some land out of Thornton Hall for the delivery of affordable and social housing?  These are issues of importance and they need to be addressed.  We must go back, as I stated, to the local authorities and find what we can do with them on building land.  They are willing, they tell me.  They are ready.  They are keen to build properties.  We need to be clear about the channel of funding and the expertise that we can bring into play to deliver houses.<\/p><p>It is a massive task.  It is one of the biggest political challenges of our time.  Brexit, housing and health are the three key major challenges for the Government.  The Minister does not underestimate them.  I do not underestimate them and nor does any other Member.  We must deliver on housing for our people.  We delivered social housing in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  It still stands today.  It is important that we have this housing for people.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I do not doubt his absolute commitment to this task.  It is an unenviable one.  It is difficult.  I would like the Minister to finally touch on the issue of the national affordable housing scheme and the related regulations.  I understand from the Department officials that there is work going on regarding the necessary regulations around that but we need to fast-track that scheme.  We need to get it out into the public domain as quickly as possible because we want to assist people to own their own homes or to rent homes.  We want people to be in homes and to be happy and have good, sustainable communities.  This will not happen overnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#CC00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, back to the House and thank him for giving us an update from his perspective on where we are at with regard to the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  I believe it is important that we continue to have this engagement at policy level, from the Oireachtas right down to the local authorities, NGOs and every other stakeholder that can assist us in meeting the continuing challenge of the demand for housing, for the young people who are on housing lists around this country.  There are many young people in the Gallery here today to listen to this debate about housing.  It is about the future of Ireland.  It is about the future of citizens of this country and how they can acquire a house and a roof over their heads.  It is important that the Minister continues in this engagement and I welcome it.<\/p> <p>It is disappointing to hear Senator Murnane O'Connor in her statement give no recognition to what is being done to address what was a property and an economic crash in this country.  What we want here are solutions and we need to recognise them.  We need to identify any barriers.  The Minister asked us openly to identify the barriers and to come to him with them.  From the Opposition's point of view, and I do not want to create a row, it seems there is little understanding of what it took to rebuild Ireland's economy after the economic crash of the past number of years.  This was a crash that caused deep fundamental damage, not only to the credit institutions but to the whole construction sector and the housing and property markets as well.<\/p> <p>The following are some of the barriers I see, to offer the Minister some solutions.  If we are to meet the ambitious objectives of building so many houses in this country which we have to do, we must address the skills shortages in the trades.  If one talks to the construction sector, with which the Minister is engaged, it will say that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit the craftsmen and women to build the houses that we so badly need.  Across Government, we will need more initiatives to engage with the construction sector, with schools and colleges and, indeed, with the parents and young people of Ireland to show them that there is a sustainable future in crafts and trades in this country.  I am a tradesman.  I qualified as an electrician many years ago.  Parents and young people are scared out of their wits to get involved in the construction sector due to the damage, not only physical but psychological, that has been done.  I call on those in schools and colleges around the country to reconsider the trades because there are sustainable jobs providing we sustain the construction sector and we do not go back to the mistakes of the past where there was a boom-bust cycle.  We can sustain a reasonable number of house builds per annum that will sustain good jobs and the crafts into the future.  I put that on the record because some of it is being lost in the debate.<\/p> <p>I recognise that, in 2018, over 19,000 units were delivered in both the public and private sectors around the country.  I also recognise that over &euro;2.4 billion has been committed by the Government for housing in 2019.  That is a substantial budgetary commitment to underpin the Rebuilding Ireland plan and strategy.  As I said, we now need to focus on delivery.<\/p> <p>Another barrier I want to bring to the Minister's attention is one I identified in my own constituency in Waterford.  Tramore in County Waterford is the second largest urban area in my county.  There is a high demand for housing in that area and there are adequately zoned lands.  The local authority is positively engaging with builders to get building on those lands.  There is a big problem with mains water supply and Irish Water.  New water infrastructure is required to supply the houses on these lands.  A decision was taken recently by the regulator, who is responsible for setting the policy of connections to water, whereby the first developer that applies for connection to its housing scheme must pay the full cost of the water connection, which is making the whole scheme unviable.  That would not be so bad if it was treated in the same way as electricity is treated where if future builders connect to that same supply, the first builder will be reimbursed for its investment towards the mains infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The problem I have identified is that the regulator has now stated that the first builder pays the full costs, subsequent builders can connect to that scheme and the first builder gets no reimbursement.  This is causing a blockage and a barrier.  It is causing a stalemate where all builders now are standing back and the houses are not being built.  This is a real practical problem that has emerged in Tramore in County Waterford.  It is something that has to be addressed.  I would ask the Minister to use his office to bring the stakeholders together.  These would include the Department officials, the regulator's officials, maybe representatives from the local authority and representatives from the construction sector.  This is a problem that has emerged in Waterford and no doubt it will emerge somewhere else.  The regulator which, I acknowledge, is an independent quasi-judicial officer, is inconsistent.  As a public representative and somebody who worked in utilities for over 20 years with the ESB, water is being treated differently to other utilities.  It is becoming a cost barrier to housing schemes being built, not only in Tramore but in other areas where one will see further blockages as well.  It is something the Minister needs to take up and resolve so that we can get these builders onto the sites and get the houses delivered for the people who require them so badly.<\/p> <p>The Minister identified the proposals and initiatives that he has implemented to combat homelessness and, especially in this cold weather spell, the further initiatives to protect those who find themselves in need of emergency accommodation.  I commend that work.  I also commend the many volunteers in organisations, and the NGOs, that work with the local authorities to assist people in finding homes.  It is a fundamental requirement for all of us to help people get a roof over their head.<\/p> <p>I wish the Minister well in his continued efforts to tackle this challenge.  The statistics are there to be seen.  As I stated, in 2018, there were 19,000 units built.  We need to increase that.  Substantial funding has now been put in place.  The numbers of planning permissions around the country for schemes and housing are way up on those of the past number of years.  Rebuilding Ireland is working and we must stick to the task.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must identify the barriers and find the solutions.

In 1999, leading academics in University College Dublin published the study, <i>Social Housing in Ireland: A Study of Success, Failure and Lessons Learned<\/i>.  Twenty years on, this study remains the benchmark contemporary study into social housing in this State.  It contains in-depth analysis of the variance of social housing from the impact of the built environment, residents&rsquo; quality of life, social order problems, relationships with local authorities and other agencies.  The study found that politicians had widespread misconceptions when it came to social housing and its successes and stated that policymakers &quot;fail to recognise that non-provision of such housing would amount to greater failure for the less well-off&quot;.<\/p><p>In 2004, the National Economic and Social Council published the report, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, which gave the most detailed analysis of the State's housing system ever produced.  This report stated, at that time, that there was a need to dramatically increase investment in, and output of, social housing owned and managed by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The report also strongly advocated the creation of a significant affordable cost-rental sector for those intermediate households ineligible for social housing but unable to afford to rent or buy a home.  Had this advice been heeded at that time by Fianna F&aacute;il, whose members are now trying to take the high moral ground in respect of housing in what is a bit like a black comedy, we may have averted a housing crisis or at least softened its blows.<\/p><p>Three successive Governments have published strategies.  Fianna F&aacute;il published Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities in 2007; Fine Gael and Labour published their Social Housing Strategy 2020 in 2014; and, most recently, Fine Gael published Rebuilding Ireland in 2016.  All three of these strategies seemed to be less detailed than, cognisant of and simply ignorant of those two major studies that preceded them.  What succeeded this was a modest output of social housing; an increasing reliance on subsidised private rental accommodation to meet social housing need; zero non-market affordable rental or purchase housing for intermediate households; and an increasing use of market-based financing mechanisms for delivering social and affordable housing.  The consequences over the 14 years are indisputable: rising levels of social housing needed; ever greater levels of homelessness; and growing numbers of people locked out of buying or renting their own home.<\/p><p>However, despite the clear conflict between ideology and expert opinion in this regard, we still do not answer the calls of what is glaringly obvious.  Light-touch intervention, chronic underinvestment and over-reliance on a neoliberal market to sort a social issue have failed.  In 2016, the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government recommended that 10,000 social houses be built, along with 5,000 affordable cost-rental homes.  This call was again made in a D&aacute;il motion passed by all Opposition parties and many Independents on 3 October, which comprised the Raise the Roof campaign&rsquo;s demands.<\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland 2018 third quarter social housing building report showed that a total of 2,369 social housing units had been built across the State by the end of September, less than half of its meagre targets.  Failing to sufficiently deliver social housing in the depths of the housing crisis has not only condemned those who are waiting to wait even longer but, as stated in the 2004 NESC study, the great benefit of having a larger public housing sector is that it stabilises the entire housing system, especially at times of shock.  Alongside the obvious chronic underinvestment, the Government is also failing to make policy progress on issues that simply have an ideological irrelevance more so than any evidence base.  Emergency measures to stop the flow of families into homelessness, including passing the Focus Ireland amendment to prevent buy-to-let landlords evicting tenants when selling due to mortgage distress, are relevant in this context and greater efforts to protect those at risk of homelessness due to mortgage arrears, as well as stronger protections for tenants, including a rent freeze and refundable tax relief, must also be priorities.  Low-hanging fruit policy measures such as the inclusion of student accommodation into rent pressure zones, Airbnb regulations, a robust vacant site levy and a deposit retention scheme, are all forthcoming at a snail&rsquo;s pace in the midst of a crisis that needs affirmative action.<\/p><p>The right to housing, which was recommended by the Constitutional Convention in 2014, has languished in the finance committee and has been, ultimately, met with Government indifference.  This is despite the right to housing being recognised in Europe in the constitutions of Belgium, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, and in the legislation of Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Britain.  Around the world, the right to housing is included in 81 constitutions.  Furthermore, the State has not yet ratified the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which would establish a right to housing.<\/p><p>While we cannot expect leadership on this conversation by this Government, the Raise the Roof campaign is holding a conference today where the right to housing is its core demand.  Will the Government continue to ignore the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention and the ratification of the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or could we have a conversation about the right to housing that would seek to help our most vulnerable who are lacking legal rights?  Can we expect to see an improvement in the social housing output, given the poor results of 2018?  We are in the midst of this crisis and we cannot under-deliver any further.<\/p><p>Some progress has been made on the pyrite situation with the Minister of State, Deputy English, but there are houses which are desperately in need of repair.  If the Minister cannot deal with this today, perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy English, could come back to tell us what stage the work is at.  The tardiness of the work, from start to finish, is not acceptable.  I know people who know that their houses have pyrite but they cannot prove it without having the test and they cannot afford the test.  Their mortgages have been taken over by vulture funds and they are very afraid of what will happen in the negotiations with those funds, given the fact that they have an asset with pyrite that is not worth the amount of their mortgage.<\/p><p>I also ask the Minister to have a look at the planning guidelines around planning permissions given by local authorities.  A more holistic approach needs to be taken to planning permissions, and this is not to say there should be unsustainable planning.  We need to take into account situations where the rent families are paying has got so high they cannot afford it, meaning they are in danger of being made homeless but they cannot get permission to build on their own land.  There needs to be flexibility and I am not talking about the reckless planning that obtained under Fianna F&aacute;il.  I seek sustainable planning permission that takes into account the need of families in the housing crisis we face at present.<\/p><p>I am concerned about ever-increasing rents, not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  People are in fear of rents being increased or cannot afford their rent at present and are engaging with moneylenders and other sources of finance just to keep the roof over their heads.  I ask the Minister to have a look at the HAP and RAS schemes and the amount of money being spent on them, as well as on housing grants.  I ask him to liaise with local authorities on housing grants in order to provide a bit of flexibility.  In some cases, the wind is coming through the doors and windows and while they can get those fixed, they cannot get their roof done.  It does not matter where the wind is coming in - it needs to be addressed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to increase the grants available to households, particularly elderly people and people with disabilities, so they do not have to stop when the work is only half done.

There is a shortage of housing in the private rental sector.  People on the social housing list are finding it difficult to get private rental accommodation and rents are starting to increase.  When I look around, though, I see a large number of empty houses.  Many are privately owned.  What has been the effectiveness of the repair and lease scheme and the buy and renew scheme and how have they been put into action in counties like Mayo?  Thankfully, it does not have the same housing crisis as the large population centres, but many people are living in fear that, if they are put out of their current accommodation for whatever legitimate reason, they will have nowhere to go.  All the time, they are waiting to be housed by the local authority.  I see little evidence on the ground of the schemes' implementation.  As has been well debated, if they were implemented, we could see renewal in areas where there was housing stock that needed upgrading.  However, that is not happening.<\/p> <p>What meetings has the Minister had with the chief executives of the local authorities?  He has met them, but how are they being held to account?  The Minister has described the significant amounts of money available for the delivery of social housing and other schemes, but there is no evidence of same.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister review the maximum annual income bands under the social housing assessment regulations?  In Mayo, a household of two adults and three children that exceeds &euro;28,000 in income is not eligible for any sort of housing support, including social housing.  I am dealing with a couple who are just &euro;24 over the limit.  They are paying for everything.  They are paying rent of &euro;600 per month, which is probably modest by national standards but, given their income, is a significant amount.  Their rent is being increased to &euro;700 and they cannot find accommodation anywhere else.  They are fearful that they will be out on the street.  They do not want to come to the State seeking help, but they cannot get any support because of the limit.  The sum they are allowed to earn is too low.<\/p> <p>In the area in which I live, there used to be a good mix of social housing.  Council housing had people who were working, people who were unable to work for various reasons, older people, single parents, etc.  Now, very few people who are working or in a position to work are to be found in the newer social housing allocations, yet people on low incomes are hard pressed.  The couple in question have been married for 20 years and never managed to get on the housing ladder.  Now they find that they cannot even afford to pay rent.  They did not set out to seek anything from the State, but we have an obligation to them.  Such people should be catered for in our vision of social housing provision.<\/p> <p>Regarding tenants buying out houses, there are people in receipt of certain social welfare payments that cannot be included in the calculation of their ability to repay a loan.  This is despite the fact that, if they had a loan, they would be paying more or less the same amount as they are paying in rent to the local authority.  It is a good policy to encourage people to buy their homes.  There would be more investment and people would have a greater stake in their respective areas if they owned homes there.

It is important that the scheme be published, that we start tackling the problem and that houses begin to get fixed so that people can know where they stand.  Not all of the houses will be done at once.<\/p> <p>I have a particular concern.  Under the scheme that is available in Leinster, which covers pyritic heave in foundations, no retrospective payments were made to householders.  That is a general principle of newly-established schemes.  I brought the Minister of State to a house where a couple had needed to put their life savings into it because of a pyrite problem and their roof was in danger of structural collapse.  They had a supervising engineer.  Within the bounds of vouching that the works have been done and what their cost was, we must find a way of making some contribution.  It would be unfortunate were we unable to accommodate such cases in some way.  The number involved is not large, as not everyone's house was in so much danger that work had been necessary.  In this instance, however, it was.  I know of a couple of such cases.  Before the scheme is published, this issue should be considered so that the people who fall into this category are accommodated.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the Minister's responses to the various issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#FF01200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1548844200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  We must put the housing crisis and where it started in perspective so that we do not make the same mistakes again.  I am evidence driven.  In the 2000s, the idea was that the market would resolve everything and there was an over-reliance on rent allowance, which was an emergency measure that became a housing policy.  Much of this dates back to when one of the Minister's predecessors, Mr. Noel Dempsey, lost that Ministry.  He was progressive and piloted a scheme of 20% social and affordable housing in the Dublin docklands before rolling it out in national legislation.  Unfortunately, it was unwound by former Deputy Martin Cullen when he took over that Ministry.  That is the heart of the problem in the Dublin area because we lost the 20% of all houses that were built during the boom.  The decision was influenced by the Progressive Democrats ideology of market-driven solutions.  Market driven does not supply.  When the recession hit, we did not have the social housing stock we should have had, leading to us having to depend on the rent allowance.  The story continues.<\/p> <p>I wish to put in context the next part of my contribution.  It is based on the work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, information on residential investment in all quarters during 2018, Hooke &amp;amp; MacDonald's investment report for 2018, Threshold's submissions to various committees and the Central Bank quarterly bulletins for 2017 and 2018.  One of the reasons for going into this in such depth is because I have met many young couples and individuals who moved home after saving their deposits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019013000002#FF01300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548844200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
