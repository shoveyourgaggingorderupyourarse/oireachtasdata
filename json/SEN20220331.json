The Minister of State is very welcome and I thank him for coming here to debate this all-important topic.<\/p> <p>We are all concerned about climate but one thing that I am very concerned about and on which I am hearing from some farmers is that they are looking for a clear pathway as to what supports and grants are available to them in respect of climate resilience.  Farmers have been through a turbulent time between Covid-19, Brexit prior to that, and now with the crisis and war between Russia and Ukraine.  They have had to deal with a great deal in recent years.  <\/p> <p>My concern is to ask the Minister of State to outline, first, what supports are being put in place.  On the different grants and supports, will there be a go-to person like a one-stop-shop, where farmers can go for support and to ask questions?  One size does not fit all when it comes to farming because there are big and small firms.  The grants and supports and any directives that are coming have to be tailored to meet the needs of the farm.  <\/p> <p>While I know that this cannot be done on an individual basis, there needs to be separate criteria for smaller farmers compared with the larger farmers.  Sometimes the larger farmers may have the resources and it may be easier for them to carry out the necessary works whereas some of the smaller farmers are under a great deal of financial pressure.  This is something that certainly needs to be highlighted.  <\/p> <p>I am interested then in hearing what supports and measures are being put in place to support farmers, be they small or large, and whether there will be a one-stop-shop.  At this time, especially, they need our support more than ever.  I know that Teagasc and the different farm advisory groups are carrying out very important work but there has to be an open door of communication with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, also.  I thank the Minister of State and look forward to hearing his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#A00500","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senator Maria Byrne for raising this very important issue.<\/p> <p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits the agriculture sector to reducing its emissions by between 21% and 30%, which is a doubling of commitment based on the Climate Action Plan 2019.  This means agriculture emissions are to reduce to between 16 million to 18 million tonnes in 2030, which is an absolute reduction of between 5 million and 7 million tonnes.  The sector will also contribute additionally through reducing land-based emissions, through better managing our soils and, in particular, peat soils.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The focus over the next decade will be on a significant cut in chemical nitrogen use, by making better use of organic manures and transitioning to clover and multispecies swards.  The sector will also transition away from the use of use of calcium ammonium nitrate and will use protected urea as its main source of chemical fertiliser.  This will help reduce absolute farm emissions.  The beef sector will need to transition to a system that reduces the average finishing age from the current 27-month average to 24 months.  This will reduce absolute methane emissions on farms.<\/p><p>While existing measures and technologies will bring agriculture very close to the upper end of its proposed agreed range, new technologies or some diversification will be needed.  While the sector broadly will be able to maintain agricultural output in our beef and dairy sectors, it is clear that emissions from the dairy sector present a significant challenge.  The objective of the recently convened Food Vision 2030 dairy group is to consider how best to stabilise and then reduce emissions from the dairy sector to ensure that the overall sector&rsquo;s climate targets remain within reach.<\/p><p>The Common Agricultural Policy strategic plan, CSP, for 2023 to 2027 will be an important delivery mechanism to achieve our climate ambition.  The environmental and climate ambition within the CSP will be aligned to the new green architecture of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  This will operate across both pillars of CAP expenditure to achieve a coherent overall approach.  A huge increase in funding for a CAP strategic plan will support farm incomes, while significantly increasing environmental ambition.  A total expenditure under the plan to &euro;9.83 billion by the end of 2027 is planned.  This is a clear example of our desire to support our farmers and the tremendous work that they do.<\/p><p>Critical to reducing the climate footprint of Irish agriculture is the role of research, innovation and knowledge exchange.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine funds research in this area through national and international competitive funding mechanisms that over the past six years have allocated up to &euro;30 million on climate, greenhouse gas, GHG, emission mitigation and climate-related co-benefit research.  Coupled to this is the grant-in-aid to Teagasc, such as the &euro;147 million provided in 2021, which is directed towards research and farm advisory activities related to climate-smart and sustainable agriculture.<\/p><p>Examples of projects funded by the Department which will feed into knowledge and strategies to reduce farm carbon footprints include Farm-Carbon, which is exploring the contribution of on-farm hedgerows and non-forest woodland to carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes, or SmartGrass and SmartSward, which recently researched multispecies swards and also served to inform the recently announced multispecies sward measure as part of a support package to farmers worth &euro;12 million.  <\/p><p>The Senator also talked about having a go-to person or a one-stop shop.

Ireland is at a crisis in terms of our grain and feed suppliers.  Farmers have been encouraged to actually plant grain, which is a thing they have not done in many years, certainly in large quantities.  I would like to see supports being mentioned around that whole area because there will be a shortage to do with the food supply chain and it is a key area that needs to be looked at.  Perhaps the Minister of State can bring that back as well because these are very important things.<\/p> <p>There is a fear factor with the farmers.  I understand that Teagasc is doing a great job and everything and the grant of &euro;147 million provided in 2021 is to be welcomed, and I am sure there will be an even greater fund in 2022 with all that farmers are going through, but there probably needs to be more co-operation and reaching out to farmers of all sizes, from the small to larger farmers.

I know it is not exactly his role, but I suppose he is here to bring the message back.  I will not attack him personally.<\/p> <p>The recently-broadcast television programme highlighting the lack of transparency in local authorities was shocking.  It must be frustrating for the people of Ireland, whose only say in local authorities is voting for their local county councillor, because there is this other tier in the council, removed from the public representatives, that has been put there by people who were not chosen by the people, yet who are there to run the county for the people of the county.  We need to look at that and see what we can do to improve it to give people faith in their local civil servants and make sure there is a bridge between people on the ground in their communities who know what is needed and wanted and the people making the decisions on how money should be spent and what the priorities are in the county.  <\/p> <p>I would be interested to hear if, even if there was no &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; report, this is something perhaps that the Minister was looking at anyway.  I know there has been work and discussions on looking at local authorities and how they operate and their decision-making.  It is not clear from local authority to local authority what the decision-making process is.  Who gets to decide the county's priority?  Is it this one golden egg that will make the council a load of money in one place, is it coming from the communities themselves, saying what they need and want, is it just based on F&aacute;ilte Ireland giving local authorities money for a certain project so that is what they will do, or is it the case where there is money for something so that is what they will do?  <\/p> <p>We have public participation network, PPNs, that I would love seeing more of because they bring in people from communities into the council.  I do not know how valued they are in their respective local authorities.  I cannot criticise any or all local authorities because there is no consistency.  If there is no consistency, that should be based on the fact that they represent the people of that county.  That is only reason there should be inconsistencies, otherwise there should be good community development workers in each county who reach out to communities, listen to what is needed by them, and then bring that back into the local authority, with that then becoming a priority for the local authority.<\/p> <p>Some counties have a climate, biodiversity, heritage or sustainable transport officers, and some have none of those.  Some have them but do not really value them.  The inconsistency across the State is quite worrying in some ways because, at the end of the day, local authorities have much responsibility.  They are the closest to the people who live in our societies and have opinions and desires.<\/p> <p>We need to look at the fact there is no participation in how the budget is spent because it is decided behind closed doors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey :<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is no democratic participation.

We have to look at democratising local government a lot more.<\/p><p>Even with regard to the PPNs, with the best will in the world, they are not given much of a platform and many community groups are not engaged with them either.  I would love to see community development workers going out to communities and holding public meetings.  There is this fear of holding public meetings.  We used to be great for public meetings long ago and it was the best thing.  Yes, there was war and there were fights, but maybe it is okay to express ourselves.  Sometimes all people want is to be listened to, and they can then accept that, for the community as a whole, this is a more important thing.  However, we cannot be dictated to by where the funding is or what some random individual in one local authority has as a priority for themselves and their mission.  We need to see consistency in representation.<\/p><p>It is hard for the councillors in some ways because they are picked by the people so it is all their fault if something is not happening.  However, they are not the big decision-makers in the local authorities and we know that.  It would be good to see us looking at how we can make people have more faith in local authority decision-making and at how the councillors themselves can be more involved.  That would be more democratic and more inclusive and would mean communities are being listened to and are influencing the decisions made by local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#B00400","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Garvey for raising a very important issue and a very important point.  I was a member of Roscommon County Council from 1999 to 2003, before the dual mandate ended.  The dual mandate change had a purpose because we were in Dublin trying to be at all of the various meetings, from the county enterprise board to the vocational education committee, VEC, to the regional authorities, and it simply was not sustainable.  However, the current system does lose that kind of work on the ground, which is where the local authority members are very important.  They get elected by the community and they work with all of the various communities.<\/p> <p>The Senator rightly referred to the PPN.  I did not realise the nature of the responsibilities and the work schedule.  If people are elected to the local authority, they have a responsibility and, while I will not call it power, they have a workload to deliver for their community but also for the county and the country.  Senator Garvey also talked about the live streaming of council meetings, which some councils do, and it is open and transparent.<\/p> <p>The &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme was critical of the level of accountability and transparency within the local government system, citing a number of specific cases in local authorities to back up its claims.  It is somewhat ironic that, in doing so, RT&Eacute; relied to a significant extent on the work and findings of the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS.  In fact, the majority of the cases highlighted in the programme were taken from LGAS audit reports, which are published annually, and management letters issued to local authorities in the course of the annual audit.  The reporting of these audit issues illustrates the positive impact the LGAS has on systems and procedures in local authorities.<\/p> <p>The programme also highlighted instances where disciplinary proceedings were pursued by local authorities against members of staff and reports referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  It is correct that details of such cases would not be put in the public domain for reasons of natural justice, but also in case doing so would prejudice the Garda investigation.<\/p> <p>It is important to bear in mind that local authorities are entirely independent corporate entities.  They have a constitutional basis, and Article 28A of the Constitution recognises the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of communities and in exercising and performing powers conferred by law.  Like the board of directors of a public company, an elected council&rsquo;s key role is the governance and oversight of their local authority, including in regard to audit practices and holding the chief executive and his or her officials to account.  These functions are set down in law.  Elected councils and councillors take this oversight and governance role very seriously.  The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and local authorities work hard to ensure that councillors are equipped and trained to fulfil this vital role.  Some of the cases highlighted by RT&Eacute; were debated and agreed by majority resolution of the elected council.  In those cases, this was the appropriate forum for those issues to be addressed.<\/p> <p>We should recognise that the Local Government Reform Act 2014 introduced significant improvements in local government accountability arrangements and further strengthened governance in local authorities.  The Act reinforced the operation of audit committees in local authorities and established the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  Audit committees review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within the local authority.  They also review any audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report in regard to the local authority and assess actions taken by the chief executive in response.  The NOAC is the national independent oversight body for the local government sector.  The NOAC&rsquo;s functions cover all local authority activities and involve the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically, as well as supporting best practice.  Both the NOAC and the Local Government Audit Service have had periodic attendance at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#C00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  It is great that he acknowledged the Local Government Audit Service but, first, who knew that was even there and, second, who has time to check it up?  We do not want to create a way of keeping an eye on the local authority.  It is not like that.  What we need is for people to have trust in the local authority in order that they do not have to find time to check the auditing services to see what they are up to.  For me, what is important is that we know what local authorities are doing.  I am not criticising Clare County Council, which does a lot of good work, as do many local authorities, but we need people to feel that those working in the local authorities, especially the decision-makers at the top, are doing so with the will of the people.  That is their job.  They are civil servants and they are there to serve civil society.  It is a matter of seeing how that is happening and how the decision-making is being done.  This is to make sure they represent what people's needs and wants are in the locality, as opposed to them spending &euro;7.8 million on this one thing they have decided will make them a load of money, while people are trying to campaign for one pedestrian crossing, one public seat or one playground.

The Bill will also provide for the possibility of plebiscites on directly-elected mayors with executive functions in other local authorities.

I need to bring him back to the 1990s, when a number of what were known as regional orthodontic units were set up around the country to treat children who needed dental work on public waiting lists.  At the time, waiting lists were very long but, within a few years, the regional units proved very successful at reducing waiting times.  In fact, in Dublin and the mid-Leinster area, we understand waiting lists were more than halved from 18,000 children to approximately 6,000 children.  All of that changed when, in the late 1990s, support for the regional orthodontic units was withdrawn.  As a result, the units ran into trouble and, in effect, began to collapse.<\/p> <p>The regional orthodontic units in Dublin and the mid-Leinster area were particularly affected and the knock-on effect was that up to 9,000 children were left stranded mid-treatment.  Many of them were still wearing orthodontic appliances, meaning some suffered irreversible damage.  The situation deteriorated so much that some parents staged sit-ins in dental clinics as they desperately tried to get treatment for their children.  In particular, an orthodontist, Ted McNamara, expressed serious concern in regard to what was happening.  The HSE appointed two people to investigate - Professor Richmond from Cardiff and Professor Bearn from Dundee &ndash; and they reported back to the HSE in 2015.  However, four years later the report had still not been published.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In 2019, the issue was highlighted by an RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme.  We know the medical files of more than 7,500 children were reviewed as part of a large-scale audit by the HSE following these allegations.<\/p><p>When regional orthodontic units were practically abandoned back then, many children were left with orthodontic appliances in for far too long.  They were left stranded and without care and, in some cases, were left with irreversible damage.  Some of these children were left with pain, as well as distortion of the teeth much worse than they had before they started treatment.<\/p><p>However, the original damning report that was given to the HSE in 2015, seven years ago, has still not been published.  We know the audit of these files has been completed but there is still no publication.  Will the report be published soon, even in redacted form if necessary?  In the seven years we have been awaiting publication of that report, what has changed to prevent further damage being done and to ensure the best standards of practice are being maintained by practitioners in the profession, particularly those in the public service?  What changes to the orthodontic teaching, training and monitoring of practice are in place?  Why might Ted McNamara and some of his orthodontist colleagues be feeling that they have been ignored and undermined?<\/p><p>Some orthodontists claimed the recruitment process was rife with nepotism and that some professionals lacked the proper postgraduate qualifications.  It would be helpful to know what is being done to increase the availability of orthodontic treatment in the public sector for children who need these services, because it appears the system supports the private model of provision of orthodontic services rather than encouraging a better service for the public sector.<\/p><p>I cannot help but mention the crisis in wider dental care for children, especially those who rely on the public system.  We need drastic changes to help stop dentists leaving the medical card scheme.  I presume this has a direct effect on the orthodontist service as well.

As he stated, in 2015 a review report was commissioned by the HSE following receipt of a statement of concern relating to an orthodontic service serving the greater Dublin area between 1992 and 2002.  This review was, in fact, a scoping report commissioned to advise the HSE on what action should be taken to determine if there was a risk of harm to patients in this case.  The 2015 report did not include a review of patient records for the period and so, understandably, reliable conclusions could not be drawn at the time in respect of potential patient harm.<\/p> <p>Following receipt of that report, the HSE initiated a comprehensive audit of more than 7,500 patient files available from that period.  Due to the scale of the audit and the requirements for specialist staff and resources, the timeline was protracted.  While the HSE regrets that this work has taken so long to progress, its priority all times has been for a robust audit on which to base any further action required.  The audit and clinical review of relevant patient files from the period was completed in 2020.<\/p> <p>As a result of this complex and large-scale audit, it was found that 16 of more than 7,500 records reviewed by clinicians did not include a documented endpoint to the patient's treatment with braces.  The HSE has issued correspondence to all of the patients identified as requiring recall and the process of engagement with them is ongoing.  The timeline for review prioritises affording patients time to engage with the HSE at their own pace and in the context of the overall Covid-19 restrictions.  The HSE advises that a draft report has been submitted to the commissioner, the HSE national director of community operations.  Once the commissioner has accepted the report and the patients have been engaged with and given a copy, the report will be made available to stakeholders.  <\/p> <p>The Senator referred to Ted McNamara in the context of the report.  To me, seven years is far too long, Covid-19 notwithstanding.  I hope the report will be made available to stakeholders as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately, those assurances have been reneged on by the HSE.  As the Minister of State noted, it is completely unacceptable.  I am placing my faith in the Minister of State because the scripted response he was handed by his colleagues in the Department does not give me reassurance.  I want to be clear on that.  His scripted response states that the report will be made available to stakeholders.  That is not the same as it being published.  It does not give any timeline.

I ask him to outline the progress on the building of the national children's hospital, the costs to date, the anticipated costs and, most important, the planned opening date.<\/p> <p>I noticed that in responding on the previous Commencement matter, he observed that seven years is a long time.  As he is aware, the planning and development of the national children's hospital has been going on for more than two decades.  Planning permission for the site at St. James's Hospital was secured in 2016.  From an initial budget of &euro;983 million in 2017, the budget has grown to &euro;1.7 billion.  How much has been spent?  What do the Minister of State, the Department and the HSE anticipate will be the final budget before the hospital is open?  The most recent opening date we have been given is the second half of 2024.<\/p> <p>As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, there are significant concerns in respect of inflation of construction costs and the shortage of labour, the impact that will have and if it has been factored in.

The Minister of State will appreciate that there is real frustration on the part of the public around some of the capital projects and this one, which is almost a signature capital project, has seen costs appearing to rise and rise again.  There does not seem to be a sufficient level of accountability around those rising costs and we, as taxpayers, are picking them up.  It is not even certain when the hospital will finally be completed.<\/p><p>It is important, not just today but on a regular basis, that the public be informed about what is happening with this really important capital project.  The Minister of State should be able to provide assurances that there are sufficient levels of project and capital management to ensure the budgets are being kept on as tight a rein as possible.  The Minister of States knows that one of the difficulties when it comes to major capital projects is that there is often a suspicion that the Government is not controlling expenditure and these costs spiral as a result.  Everybody expects that the &euro;1.7 billion will be exceeded, but I would be particularly grateful if the Minister of State could provide some clarity on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#D00500","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to provide an update on progress to date on the new children's hospital.  The hospital project includes the main hospital on a shared campus at St. James's Hospital, the outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown and the outpatient and emergency care centre at Tallaght University Hospital.  In November 2021, the Minister opened the paediatric outpatient and emergency care centre in Tallaght, which will accommodate up to 17,000 outpatients and 25,000 emergency care patients per year.  It is the second major milestone delivered on the national children's hospital project after the facility at Connolly Hospital opened in July 2019.  In 2021, over 13,000 outpatients attended at Connolly and over 11,000 patients attended for urgent care.  More than 95% of those presenting for urgent care could go home after treatment and waiting lists for general paediatric procedures reduced significantly within a year of the facility's opening.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that the national children's hospital project has had its difficulties and delays.  It is important to acknowledge the great progress also being made at the main building at the St. James's campus.  In 2021 the building was topped out to its highest level and the final significant concrete pours were made.  The stone and glazed facade is now largely complete and sections of external scaffolding are now being taken down to reveal the fantastic structure.  Internal fitting out of all clinical areas is now under way.  The building was also recently connected to the ESB network, which is another important project milestone.<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, this remains a complex project with more than 40,000 activities detailed in the contractor's programme to complete the over 6,000 room spaces in the new hospital.  The capital budget approved by the Government for the new children's hospital is &euro;1.433 billion.  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainty for them, and these include construction inflation greater than 4% and the impact of Covid-19.  The capital budget has not been depleted, with just over &euro;960 million drawn down to date.  In addition to the capital project, there is a broader programme of activity, including new information and communications technology and electronic health record development and integration and transfer of the services of the three children's hospitals to the new sites.  That will bring about a total overall programme cost of &euro;1.73 billion.<\/p> <p>The contractor's schedule suggests substantial completion can be achieved by December 2023.  This could allow the hospital to open in the second half of 2024 after the necessary commissioning period.  The development board and contractor are working to do everything they can to ensure this new substantial completion date and opening can be met.  However, there remains external risks to this project, as with many other construction projects, arising from Brexit, the pandemic and global supply chain difficulties.  The invasion of Ukraine will undoubtedly have compounded such issues.  As delays are the biggest contributors to cost, everything possible is being done to ensure the project can be completed as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#E00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

We all know that the context for this is the very significant increase in wholesale fuel prices.  Most of our electricity is guided by the price of gas and the cost of a therm of gas has gone from 60p prior to the Covid-19 pandemic to approximately &pound;2.30 on the international trading market.  That is a very significant increase, so there is a clear context or reason for electricity prices increasing.<\/p> <p>However, I am concerned about the fact that the fixed standing charge is being increased as well.  I note from Electric Ireland that it is increasing its standing charge by 36% and Bord G&aacute;is is increasing its standing charge by 43%.  The standing charge is a fixed amount that is added to the top of one's tariff rate to cover the energy supplier's fixed costs.  That is the cost of paying for delivering the gas to the home.  To some extent it is understandable that this might increase in line with inflation, but inflation is expected to reach 8.5% this year.  I do not understand why the fixed charge in Electric Ireland has gone up by 36% and by 43% in Bord G&aacute;is when inflation is only pegged at 8.5%.  I am somewhat concerned that the electricity supply companies are using the massive increase in the wholesale price of gas, and we see it fluctuating daily, to justify their increase in the overall cost to the consumer.  There is a justifiable increase in the cost to the consumer but it relates to the cost of gas, not the cost of delivery.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Leader might arrange for a debate in the House or she could write to the Minister and ask that the matter be referred to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  As with lots of other companies, when everything gets out of control there are opportunities to slip in additional charges and costs, which are not to the benefit of the Irish consumer.  We are aware of the pain and suffering people will go through with the increases in the cost of living as a result of the supply chain issues due to Covid-19 followed immediately by the impact of the crisis fallout from the war.  We must ensure that people are protected to the greatest extent possible and that there can be no opportunity, particularly for utility companies, to gouge consumers under the fog of increased prices associated with the war.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#K00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a couple of items relating to the census.  I heard Senator Malcolm Byrne refer to people who would obstruct the work of the census or make life difficult for census enumerators as \"muppets\".  I certainly have no sympathy with any such obstructive tactics by people, but it is important to say that part of the democratic contract between us and which binds us to the State is that in return for our compliance we can expect fairness, accuracy, transparency, accountability and adherence to high standards.<\/p> <p>Turning to the question of the assignation of sex, the Central Statistics Office website states that if people are uncomfortable ticking one of the options of \"male\" or \"female\", they can mark both boxes and, for analytical purposes, then a sex will be assigned at random.  Bearing in mind that, normally, supplying false information is subject to a very serious fine, the website is telling people that if they are uncomfortable with this or that aspect of the process they may do something that otherwise would come under the heading of false information.<\/p> <p>Regardless of what one thinks about the debate about so-called transgender rights, and that is a term that can mean different things to different people, it cannot be right that people would be asked to supply false information if they are uncomfortable about answering correctly.  If I feel uncomfortable about answering some other section of the census, am I entitled to answer it incorrectly?  Less an example of sloppiness, it is a decline in the standard of accountability, fairness, accuracy and respect for process that we see in different areas in these times.<\/p> <p>I have had extreme difficulty getting the Minister for Health and the Department of Health to answer a basic question.  As an elected representative, when I write a letter to the Minister for Health or to Ms Geraldine Luddy in the Department of Health and the people involved in the three-year review of abortion, as I have done, asking about whether people can supply information in a free-form manner other than the prescribed template and whether their issue will be considered, and when I do not even get an answer to the letter and the policy of the Minister for Health is just to ignore anything coming from pro-life people as though they do not matter, what one is seeing is a decline or a small bit of death for democracy.  Everybody should matter equally in this State, and when people's elected representatives ask questions they deserve to get answers.  I have seen very bad standards from the Department of Health in recent times and I do not believe it is a forced linkage to say that what we are seeing with the census is an example of the same type of sloppiness.<\/p> <p>The census form is considered to be a notice for the purpose of the Act, and the sections require that the notice must specify a date by which the information in the form has to be returned.  It has been pointed out to me that the census form does not actually specify this date.  The form refers multiple times to census night but, bizarrely, does not specify a date.  What is going on here?  On a strict and extreme reading of the Statistics Act, that could potentially invalidate the entire census.  Is this more sloppiness coming from the system?<\/p> <p>Finally, there are the complaints from Irish speakers which tend to arise during every census.  Irish speakers do not feel they are being given an opportunity either to answer the census in Irish or to converse with enumerators in Irish.  That is something that must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#K00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Sheanad&oacute;ir.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#K00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will finish.

Of course, much of that relates to the current crisis and staff shortages but the other issue in this regard - I hope colleagues from the west of Ireland will appreciate this - is that while 90% of aeroplanes are taking off from Dublin Airport, there will always be a degree of chaos.  Right now, unfortunately, people are being asked to arrive three and a half hours early for their flights.  We need a new national airport authority with an explicit mandate for a new regional balance to support airports in Shannon and Cork and across the west of Ireland.

I know the Leader's office wrote to local authorities around the country to ask them to take part in that initiative.  Several parades did so this year.  I attended the parades in Longford and Athlone.  I commend the organisers of the festival for taking this proposal on board.  Very positive feedback was received on it.  We will keep going with the campaign to make sure every parade that does it next year.  It needs to be taken on board not just in Ireland but should be considered internationally.  We have had discussions with the organisers of the parade in New York, who will consider it for 2023.  I thank the parade organisers, particularly those in my home town, including Fiona Fenelon of Longford Chamber of Commerce, who took this on board and worked with local parents.  Ann O'Leary, whom I know personally, was involved and has been a very strong advocate for children with autism.  I thank them and put that on record.  We will keep the campaign going and make sure there is more of it next year.<\/p> <p>I refer to just transition.  Many groups are struggling for funding for projects.  The midlands, my area, has been particularly badly hit in the context of just transition by the closure of Lough Ree power station.  Significant funding has been allocated for projects but large community contributions have to be made to ensure those projects are delivered.  With prices increasing, that is becoming ever more difficult.  I did some research into funding.  The Western Development Commission, which covers the west of Ireland, was set up many years ago and provides low-interest loans.  It has a community loan fund under which loans of between &euro;25,000 and &euro;250,000 are provided at 3% over ten years.  It also provides bridging loans at 1% that can be used for match funding for LEADER projects under the rural development programme.  I ask the Government to consider extending that scheme to the areas affected under the just transition.  A significant amount of funding has been allocated for projects but these projects have not progressed as a result of the large local contribution that is required.  As one involved in community activities, I know the difficulty involved in accessing money from banks and so on.  If that community loan fund could be extended to cover the just transition area in a manner similar to the fund offered by the Western Development Commission, it would be of great benefit.  It is about adding extra counties in which groups would be eligible to apply to that fund.  I would be very grateful for that.  It would ensure we actually deliver a just transition for the midlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#L00500","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>That is an interesting proposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#L00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>It is no surprise on Trans Day of Visibility that I am offering my support and that of the Labour Party to the trans community in Ireland and worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#L00700","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#L00800","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>One of the biggest things we need to think about today, on Trans Day of Visibility, is that it is really sad that there are no trans Members of the Upper or Lower Houses.  I hope that someday that will be rectified and there will be visibility across society.  I was thinking about this in the context of the census and the binary question in respect of sex.  The census is used for many things, such as collecting data in respect of disabilities, access and travel.  It is used for planning.  Given that a couple of years ago Ireland was a beacon for trans rights and gender recognition globally - I know the Leader was a part of that - it is a real shame that this census, the biggest data-gathering exercise in the State, will not offer an opportunity for trans people and non-binary people to be seen, affirmed and heard this time around.  I hope that will be changed for the next census.  One of the biggest things on which we will lose out in this regard relates to an issue on which some of us who support our trans friends and family have spoken, namely, proper access to healthcare.  If the census does not provide data in respect of how many people will need access to this healthcare, how will we ever fully address the need for healthcare and identify what is missing?

The census is a powerful tool in the making of public policy, giving an in-depth nation-wide snapshot of who is living in Ireland and how they are living.  From housing to childcare, taxes to health services, up-to-date and accurate census information clearly displays the state of the nation, informing Government policy and programmes alike.  Thus, it follows that the inaccuracies in the information received obfuscates the reality of the situation on the ground and hinders any possible Government response.  While the issue of spoiled census forms in the manner of spoiled ballots is unavailable, it is rather a different thing for the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to direct people to give nonsensical answers on their forms.  The instruction to tick both boxes, male and female, when asked to indicate one&rsquo;s biological sex, for those who do not wish to describe themselves as either one, is not only devoid of reason, but is incompatible with gender theory, the adherence of which are very people the CSO is trying to appease.  Gender theorists have, since the 20th century, sought to establish the idea of gender as socially constructed, unfettered and distinct from biological sex.  Everyone has a sex and everyone has a gender.  One cannot choose one&rsquo;s sex, but one can choose one&rsquo;s gender.  Such is the maxim of gender theology.<\/p> <p>I would have no problem with the CSO putting in a text box in a form where anyone could fill in a gender of their choosing, so long as the essential binary sex options were there.  However, it did not think of that.  Instead, it scrambled to conjure up some compromise after the forms were printed, resulting in this muddying of our data.  The CSO of course knows that this solution makes no sense.  It does not care, because when it comes to gender in this country, sense is subservient to sensitivities.

They have a number of issues, one of which the price of fuel.  Again, to give a stark example to illustrate the huge increase that has taken place in diesel prices in the past couple of years, back in 2020, a litre of diesel cost 54 cent.  Last year, the price of that litre of diesel increased to 75 cent.  As of yesterday, a litre of diesel now costs &euro;1.35, which is a serious increase.  These contractors are very fearful that their work will grind to a halt and their machinery will not leave their yards this spring.<\/p> <p>Farm and forestry contractors employ close to 80,000 people and operate on farms the length and breadth of this country.  They are an unrecognised power group that have helped to drive Irish farming and food industry.  Without them, our farm families would simply not continue to exist.  This issue is not just simply about farm contractors; it is about much more than that.  It is about the future of farm families, the future of rural Ireland, winter food shortages, the reduction in the national herd, food exports and potential job losses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Leader to ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come before this House in order that we can have a debate specifically on the future of farm contractors and the dangers associated with their not being able to do the work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#M02900","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the bonus payment for healthcare workers.  We are still waiting for the final details or an FAQ on it.  I know it is very difficult and that there has been a lot of debate on it to decide how it will work when people have sacrificed so much.  This was a national and collective effort.  I am sure that the things being thought about include the length of time people worked.  I think especially of the people at the beginning of the pandemic who really stepped into the unknown, with the lack of PPE, the suboptimal conditions and no vaccination on the horizon.  Then we have to consider people who volunteered versus people who were employed.  We need to give consideration to the volunteers who also worked in a healthcare or clinical environment, most especially the community swabbers, who were a critical part of our response, working in places such as temporary structures and army tents, rain, hail or shine.  They did not do it for the thanks, but sometimes you give gratitude anyway.  I am thinking of somebody I know personally who did community swabbing.  She was officially hired as an employee only in May 2021 but had worked as a volunteer since the very start and stepped into the brink, as I said.  I am incredibly grateful to her for doing that.  We need to consider that group of people.  Even though the recruitment of community swabbers started only in October 2020, they were in those positions long before then.

I met the Romanian ambassador this morning.  It is really important that all our new Irish right across the country make sure they record their status and identity and let us know they are here.  In planning the curriculum, for example, if we know there are more than 100,000 Romanians here, it is more likely we may have Romanian as a leaving certificate subject on the curriculum.  It is important that people are proud of where they came from and that they put that down on the census form.  It is all completely anonymous, and it is really important that people acknowledge and appreciate that fact.  This is about planning for new communities, acknowledging where we need new schools and hospitals, acknowledging that where there are more ageing populations we need to provide for them and that where there are younger populations we need to provide for them and acknowledging where we have seen massive increases in population.  The Leader will be familiar with places in Fingal, Meath and so on that have seen huge increases in population that we do not really know about until the census data are made available.  It is the only way we know this stuff is happening.  We have had an extra year because of Covid, so it is six years since the last census.  It is vital that everybody right across the nation plays their part and answers the question on the form in as much detail and with as much honesty as they possibly can in order that we can all, as a State, provide for better services for the people living here.  That is my main point.  I encourage everyone right across the country to fill in the census form as accurately and as honestly as they can in every respect.<\/p> <p>Second, I wish the Trinity by-election candidates who are still in the race well.

Michael Tighe was one of the Jadotville heroes who have been neglected and ignored by this State for the past 65 or 70 years.  It breaks my heart to think of Michael going to his final resting place still unrecognised by the State.  Michael was one of the three people who attended Enda Kenny's office some years back and convinced him to have An Bonn Jadotville.  It was a campaign medal awarded to all those who served in Jadotville.  Contrast the treatment of Irish veterans with those of the United States.  In Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, Corporal Patrick &quot;Bob&quot; Gallagher's eternal remains rest.  Fifty-five years ago yesterday, Corporal Gallagher gave his life in the Vietnam war.  So highly did the United States think of his gallantry that they have named a ship after him, the <i>USS Patrick Gallagher<\/i>.  Just a few headstones away from Corporal Gallagher lie the eternal remains of Private Billy Kedian.  Billy was in Lebanon when the unit he was with came under mortar attack.  In order to save his comrades' lives, he threw his body at the door of the building they were in and he lost his life.  Billy has never been recognised by this State - never.  I could go on and name the people who saved John O'Connor, who was shot the day he arrived in Lebanon.  While he was severely wounded and dying, Dick O'Hanlon, Martin Fahy and two others went, under fire, to his rescue, carried him to a medical aid centre and saved his life.  They have never been recognised.  May those who have prevented medals being awarded to these heroes hang their heads in shame forever because they owe these men a damn sight more than they have ever given them.

Around the Curragh, we also have a problem with illegal encampment, which starts around this time every year.

We know that our power system is undergoing an unprecedented transformation in order to decarbonise.  However, the war in Ukraine has brought into sharp focus why it is so important not just to decarbonise our energy system from a climate perspective but also the importance of having indigenous energy security.

It also outlined other ways in which we could reduce demand on the grid and it is not the only one calling for a greater focus on demand reduction.  <\/p> <p>Last week, the Committee on Environment and Climate Action heard from the Demand Response Association of Ireland.  It outlined how demand response unlocks flexibility in how and where we use electricity and turns consumption into a tool in operating the power system.  It is through demand response that we can balance the grid without the need for additional infrastructure.  That is why it was upsetting to hear from it that it appears that demand reduction in the poor cousin of climate action.  While the Taoiseach said on radio today there is a big focus on demand reduction, at the committee we heard there have been no meetings between the Government and demand reduction organisations.

The collection of data is incredibly important for mining so that we can ascertain what kind of future policies we have and, in particular, what kind of services we have and where those services should go..  A number of people raised particular issues with it which I will touch on.  In response to Senator Ward, the stress in our household regarding what we are going to put in that particular section is causing no end of conversation at our dinner table every evening.  It is novel and allows us to reflect on the past and where people in our families were 100 years ago.  It also invites us to think about the advances in 100 years for the people who will come after us and what we are doing now in order that they have a safe environment to live in.  It is lovely.  Even if it only prompts conversations at home, it is welcome.<\/p> <p>Other colleagues have reference the oddity, if that is the nicest way I can put it, of the CSO and its officials asking people, when assigning a gender, to pick one, other or both in terms of male or female.  It would have been perfectly simple to put the categories of male, female, transgender, non-binary, gender neutral, pangender or agender on the form and allow people to tick a box, without causing consternation, upset or any difficulties for anybody.  I agree it is very odd and unfortunate and we have to make sure that we try to make sure it does not happen when we gather the next round of data in four years' time.<\/p> <p>A number of people touched on a dividing issue, which should not be divisive because human rights and treating people with dignity is something to which we should all aspire.  Today is International Transgender Day of Visibility.  I was struck by something Senator Mullen said, namely, that everybody should matter equally.  That is absolutely true.  Everybody should be treated equally with dignity and respect, regardless of the form they take.  <\/p> <p>We will have debates in this country on the provision of services, in particular healthcare services, disrespect, lack of equality and the sometimes repugnant nature of the way people are treated with a lack of dignity in this country.  We can certainly have that debate.  We cannot have a debate on differences of opinion without respect for the people at the centre of the debate.  Senator Hoey said it perfectly when she remarked that just because we might not agree with somebody's form, decisions or choices in life - we all know most of them are not choices - we do not get to disrespect people's right to be who they are, be visible in terms of who they are, be treated with respect and be acknowledged.  Many of our friends and people in our communities are treated with disregard, disrespect and downright disingenuous behaviour by some people.  To be honest, it is not good enough.  <\/p> <p>Senator Horkan asked for a debate on trans issues and the delivery of services for trans people.  It is within that debate that we can have and share our differences of opinion, but we cannot disrespect human beings who are trying to live their lives with dignity and expect us to support them with dignity regardless of whether we agree with their choices.  That is something that should be said today.  Senator Horkan also welcomed the announcement from Mr. Jamie Wallis, MP yesterday, which must have been incredibly difficult for him.  It was incredibly brave, given the backlash we see against people in the trans community.  I want to put on the record that I hope, as parliamentarians, that we all support his announcement, and continue to support what is a minority community in Ireland and around the world and treat people with respect.  <\/p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke, as she always does, with such pride about her local initiative, and I wish her every success with it.  <\/p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke about the GAA.

A number of years ago certain sports events were ring-fenced by the then Minister for sport to make sure they could never be pay-per-view.  We need to have that conversation again and I will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and will ask him to come to the House for a debate.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin spoke about World Autism Awareness Day, as did Senator Maria Byrne.  Inclusion in the workplace is something that I do not think gets enough attention.  We have a 6% target within State agencies and authorities, yet we have exactly the same recruitment mechanisms and tests for people of all abilities.  As we all know, a tremendous amount of people are on the spectrum and suffer from Asperger's syndrome, ADHD or any of a list of challenges.  They could not possibly go through a normal interview process or test in the same way as people in their whole of their ability could.  It is incumbent on the State to make sure that we reflect the target of 6% in how we recruit people.  I encourage people to make representations on that basis if they can.  <\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin also spoke about the school completion programme and the symposium held by F&oacute;rsa yesterday.  I congratulate it on that.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the census question on carers, something I forgot to mention when I spoke about it.  It is important that we gather information in respect of family carers, most of whom are unseen, in order that we can respond appropriately.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Craughwell, in quite an emotive contribution spoke about his passion for the Defence Forces and the very sad passing of Michael Tighe.  I want to put on the record of the House that we will send our deepest sympathies and condolences to Mr. Tighe's family.  Senator Horkan spoke about the Trinity by-election.  We are all political animals and we are probably all refreshing our Twitter feeds every ten or 20 seconds to see the latest news on the vote.  I thank all of the candidates for applying and for partaking in democracy in Ireland.  I wish the remaining candidates well.  I look forward to welcoming one of them as a new Senator to the House next week.<\/p><p>Senator Currie spoke about the bonus payments for healthcare workers.  As only we can do in Ireland, we take what is a wonderful initiative and make a hash of it before it finally gets awarded.  I hope a decision is reached very soon and that it is a fair and just decision that genuinely reflects the people Senator Currie spoke about this morning.  They volunteered through nothing else except good community spirit and goodwill.  We should look after everybody who minded us and served us so well during the 24 months of the pandemic.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher spoke about farm contractors and sought a debate which I will organise.  Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on trans issues and I will organise it in the coming weeks.  Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about Garda numbers specific to the Wexford division.  I suggest he writes to the Garda Commissioner and perhaps the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the basis that local garda&iacute; are being used at a national port.  Obviously the port has increased traffic and throughput because of Brexit.  Perhaps it should be a separate assignment for garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey spoke about the review of the repeal legislation and the closure date tomorrow.  I look forward to having this debate in the coming weeks once we have the review.  Senator Carrigy spoke about the success in his neck of the woods, and obviously it is because he championed it, of the silent streets for the St. Patrick's Day parade.  It is heartening to hear other parades such as that in New York will take on the initiative and look at it next year.  This will be very good.<\/p><p>Senator Gavin spoke about the safe access zone legislation that will come to the House next Thursday.  I hope that it passes and that there will not be a lengthy wait before it goes to the D&aacute;il.  It is something we genuinely all need.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne opened the debate speaking about the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and energy costs.  We will arrange a debate the week after Easter.  Arising from our contributions on that date we might collectively write to the CRU with regard to the standing charge increases that are multiples of inflation and keep a close eye on the increases we have seen announced by Bord G&aacute;is, Electric Ireland, Energia and all of the other service providers in recent weeks.  There is no doubt international prices are increasing but the prices being reflected locally are nowhere close to the prices quoted on the international markets.  We need to keep a very close eye on it.  I will organise the debate as soon as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022033100002#P00600","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648719000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader for the response.
