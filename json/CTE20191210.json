I thank the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p> <p>  As Members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and provides solicitor services within the Office of the Attorney General and to Departments and offices.  While the Taoiseach has certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the office operates independently of the Department. <\/p> <p>  The office has a wide remit, including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including attending at the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law, commercial contract and other solicitor services for the line Departments and other Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity, and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;5 million is sought to cover extra expenditure on fees to counsel in 2019.  The management of expenditure on counsels' fees is a key activity for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals, and the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable for the provision of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Office of the Attorney General or for Departments and Offices. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time, and so is always difficult for the office to forecast.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation and transactional work, procurement work, and advisory and litigation work resulting from our membership of the European Union, and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment law and social welfare law. <\/p> <p>  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex, which leads to greater use of counsel.  An allocation of &euro;13.5m was made in terms of expenditure on fees for counsel in 2019, which was the same as 2018.  However, due to a carryover of &euro;3.31 million in fees from 2018 and anticipated additional expenditure of &euro;2.29 million in 2019 a shortfall of &euro;5.6 million will arise.  The office will make use of savings of &euro;600,000 in other areas of the Vote to assist with this shortfall but a supplementary of &euro;5 million is required.<\/p><p>I should also point out the allocation for fees to counsel in 2020 has been increased by &euro;1.5 million, giving a total allocation of &euro;15 million.  The office together, with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its main client Departments in an effort to remain within budget in 2020.  I am pleased to recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#C00900","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Having considered the Supplementary Estimate and the Minister of State's remarks, the committee accepts the supplementary evidence.

I just want to clarify that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will be taking Votes 7, 9, 12 and 17.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#D01000","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes, that is correct.  I am here to present a proposal for four Supplementary Estimates, two of which come under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote group and two of which come under the Department of Finance Vote group.<\/p> <p>  On the public expenditure and reform Vote group, there is a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000, resulting in a gross Estimate of &euro;5 million, in respect of Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances.  There is a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;470,000 in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service.<\/p> <p>  On the finance Vote group, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;21.2 million is required in respect of Vote 7 - the Department of Finance, and a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4.104 million is required in respect of Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  With respect to Vote 12, pensions and lump sums paid under the pensions scheme for established civil servants make up just under 90% of gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  The main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire during the year.  There are a number of different reasons it can be difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next but the 2019 gross estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;609.9 million euro, which was based on a forecast of 1,700 retirements.  As a general rule, the once-off lump sum paid to each person who retires is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A.4, which is the main driver of expenditure variance on the Vote in any given year.  At the end of October, &euro;90.4 million had been expended from section A.4, compared with the original 2019 full-year Estimate of &euro;101.6 million.  Further expenditure of up to &euro;25.3 million is estimated by the end of the year, resulting in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;14.1 million on the subhead.   It is now estimated that total gross expenditure on the Vote may be in the region of &euro;614.9 million, which is &euro;5 million ahead of the gross Estimate as voted previously by the Oireachtas. <\/p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated somewhat by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  In 2019, these were estimated at &euro;238.6 million, which was ahead of profile.  Total appropriations are now projected to be &euro;243.6 million, which is &euro;5 million more than expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the total gross Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the Supplementary Estimate in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, the Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Vote will bring the total 2019 Estimate for that Vote to &euro;15.503 million, which is a 3.1% increase on the total allocation of &euro;15.033 million.   <\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 7 is to meet the cost of legal settlements entered into by the State following advice from senior counsel.  The settlements are in respect of protracted legal proceedings arising from the air travel tax introduced in budget 2009 and agreements which were entered into following mediation with Mr. Justice Paul Gilligan.<\/p><p>The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 9 is to meet the 2019 costs associated with developing the Brexit infrastructure required as part of our no-deal preparations.  The total cost to be met is &euro;4.104 million.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied that approval of the supplementary estimate of &euro;1,000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants expected to retire up to the end of 2019.  I am satisfied that approval of the supplementary estimate of &euro;470,000 will enable the wider public service to prepare for future challenges through the Public Appointments Service.  I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimates for the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Finance will allow us to deal with the requirements outlined in my address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#D01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Will the Minister give us some more information on the &euro;20 million for Vote 7?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#E00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the obligations entered into by the Department in the context of settlement agreements with two airlines - Aer Lingus and Ryanair.
