This report includes revised drafting suggestions for all three draft regulations.  It should be noted some elements of the three draft regulations are part of the horizontal multi-annual financial framework, MFF, negotiations.  Agreement on the MFF will, therefore, be needed before the Council can establish its overall position on the CAP post-2020.  Notwithstanding this, we have made considerable progress on the horizontal regulation dealing with financial rules and the amending regulation for the Common Market Organisation, CMO.<\/p> <p>  For the horizontal regulation, which deals with the financing, management and monitoring aspects of the next CAP, member states are in broad agreement with the proposed amendments.  However, a final position on the text can only be taken once agreement has been achieved on the MFF proposals and final wording relating to certain provisions within the new delivery model within the CAP strategic plan regulation.<\/p> <p>  For the amending regulation, which deals with amending certain provisions within the common organisation of markets regulation, member states are also in broad agreement with the consolidated text and consider the regulation to be largely stable.  Some elements relating to wine labelling, financial envelopes for school schemes and the role of producer organisations are expected to require further discussion once we enter trilogue discussions with the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  Unsurprisingly, the main focus of discussions on the CAP legislative proposals during the Finnish EU Presidency was on the CAP strategic plan regulation.  The Finnish EU Presidency focussed its efforts on the new delivery model and environmental and climate-related aspects in particular.  The new delivery model is proving challenging for member states to reach agreement on.  Significant work was undertaken in an effort to address member states&rsquo; concerns around reporting requirements for non-area, non-animal-based interventions.  Ireland has been a strong voice on this issue and has worked hard with other member states to present an alternative solution to the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  Up to 12 member states have supported our alternative proposal.  However, it is still very much a matter for debate and discussions will continue under the Croatian EU presidency.  Further discussions will also continue on financial flexibility and regarding indicators to ensure they are fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  There was much discussion on environmental and climate-related aspects of the CAP strategic plan regulation.  In general, member states are in favour of a higher environmental and climate ambition, a point I have supported strongly myself.  The CAP must do more to support environmental action.  However, there are concerns and diverging views on a number of areas such as the formulation of certain standards for good agricultural and environmental condition of land and the impact on the definition of \"eligible hectare\"; how conditionality should be applied to small farmers; whether the proposed eco-scheme in pillar 1 should be mandatory or voluntary for member states; the planning of eco-schemes and the potential risk of losing funds if there is insufficient uptake.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Finnish EU Presidency has suggested the introduction of a single common percentage or fixed amount for climate and environmental expenditure across the entire CAP strategic plan budget.  The EU Presidency intends for this common percentage to replace the minimum 30% target under pillar 2 expenditure, giving member states the flexibility to decide how best to allocate their climate and environmental expenditure across pillar 1 and pillar 2.  The proposal, which suggests that only interventions appropriately targeting climate and environmental objectives would count towards this common percentage, could only be properly considered by agriculture Ministers following agreement on the MFF proposals.<\/p> <p>  In general, member states have considered the Finnish EU Presidency&rsquo;s suggestion as a basis for further discussion.  From my perspective, there are too few details around the proposal to determine a position at this early stage.  However, I have always said that Ireland accepts the increased climate ambition in the next CAP and that we are willing to examine all options that meet this objective.<\/p> <p>  In general, I broadly agree with the EU Presidency&rsquo;s progress report, considering it to be a good reflection of discussions that have taken place to date.  However, we still have some concerns over certain aspects and agree that further discussion is still required before final agreement can be achieved.  Separately, under the discussions regarding the MFF, there have been proposals which go some way towards restoring the funding for the CAP budget.  While I welcome this, I will still continue to press for the removal of all the proposed cuts in the CAP budget.  This work will continue under the Croatian EU Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019121000002#B00600","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking the time to come to the committee to present on this matter.  There is much concern in the agricultural community regarding what will happen post 2020 given there will be a minimum one-year delay in regard to the new seven-year CAP programme being put in place.  Central to this is how the transitionary period will impact on the funding farmers receive, which forms a critical part of the average family farm income.  Following the Minister's negotiations and engagements at European level, what will be the likely outcome with regard to payments during the transitionary period, in particular payments under the rural development programme, RDP, which pose a particular problem because many of them are made at a specific time?  For example, payments under the GLAS scheme form a significant part of farm income.  Under the five-year programme, participants in GLAS 1 are due to start exiting that scheme in 2020 and they will also get their final payment in 2020.  In regard to 2021, it is essential that in regard to schemes such as GLAS, areas of natural constraint, ANC, the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, the sheep welfare programme, etc., what is currently provided in annual payments continues to be paid during the transitionary period.  If these payments are allowed to lapse and the RDP is not properly funded this would have a very significant impact on farm income.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position with regard to the aforementioned schemes and payments and what he, as Minister, and the Department are seeking to achieve in the programme during the transitionary period.<\/p> <p>  I support the Minister's efforts in regard to the wider budgetary objective of ensuring that the proposed cuts for the next seven-year programme are reversed and that the budget is, at least, maintained, because that will be particularly important for agriculture.

Following on from Deputy Cahill's comments regarding young farmers, succession and so on, Austria has no problem with succession or young farmers being interested in getting into agriculture because it channels 40% of its CAP funding into pillar 2.  Ireland channels less than 20% of its CAP funding into that pillar.

Deputy McConalogue asked for clarity.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to be absolutely clear about where we are at in respect of CAP reform until such time as we know what funding is available.  The amount of funding is critical.  Senator Paul Daly alluded to this in terms of the MFF issue, which is the central plank of the Heads of State meeting later this month.  We are plugged into the deliberations on the MFF and how it impacts on the CAP because we get most of our receipts from the European Union through the CAP.  We are a net a contributor to the European project, which is reflective of the state of our economy.  We are one of the highest <i>per capita<\/i>contributors to the EU but we get most of our receipts from the Union through the CAP and, therefore, we are clued into the overall debate, in particular how we protect the CAP and our share of it.  Bringing clarity to the CAP process to reform post 2020 is inextricably linked to that issue.  We have been actively trying to forge alliances with other members states, as I have outlined previously at this committee.<\/p><p>On the second point, the Commission is facilitating transitional arrangements for a 12-month period.  Notwithstanding the progress that is being made, it is highly unlikely that the CAP will be ready following a 12-month extension.  It is likely that the extension will be for a minimum of two years, which is not desirable.  That is my reading of the position.  In regard to bringing clarity around our position in the context of those continuing uncertainties, I will attempt to do that.  Our objective is to protect the funding that is available to our farmers within this reform process and the reform of the funding of the EU for the next number of years.  When it comes to pillar 1 and pillar 2 payments, there will be changes in the new CAP to the obligations and conditionality under pillar 1, which are not currently in place, but our objective will be to protect the amount that Irish agriculture receives under the new CAP.  We are anxious to ensure that the new policy gives us the suite of policy instruments or the toolbox to enable us to drive the climate ambition that is part of our agriculture-climate public consultation.<\/p><p>As the committee knows, there is an overall Government strategy and we have our share to do.  I would argue that we start from a relatively good point with respect to the sustainability of Irish agriculture but there is undoubtedly more we can do.  The particular focus will be on nutrient management, genetics and other efficiencies, with environmental schemes delivering on biodiversity, water quality etc.<\/p><p> This is a headline view and in the context of the transition period we would like to roll over existing schemes, with flexibility where possible to pilot new initiatives particularly in the climate sector.  We have much to do in the new decade and there are onerous targets that must be achieved by 2030.  We must start immediately and we are informed in that endeavour by the Oireachtas committee mentioned by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, as well as the input of many stakeholders and the public consultation under way.  In the context of the transition arrangements, we are anxious to be enabled to get some elements up and running.  We do not have clarity around what will be facilitated in that transitional directive and it is unlikely to be finalised until mid-2020 perhaps.  We are trying to influence that structure in a way that gives us the maximum freedom to manoeuvre in order that the important elements to us, including protecting the financial support targeted at farmers and the conditionality that would give us the maximum opportunity to assist us in our climate endeavour over the next decade, would be central to the process.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill and Senator Hackett raised the matter of generational renewal, which is a critical part of the challenge facing the agricultural sector across Europe.  In response to the Senator, I have not heard it articulated that there is an oasis of optimism in Austrian agriculture, although I acknowledge it has a higher proportion of organic agriculture than us.  I am unaware that it is a panacea for generational renewal.  As far as I can see, there is a challenge in attracting younger people into agriculture in practically every country I have visited.  Not to be trite but the best way to incentivise generational renewal in farming is to give people a career pathway that will give them something comparable with peers.  Talk of lifestyle and working in the open air and with nature only goes so far.  These people want what their peers have in other employment, including holidays and being able to provide for their children.  It is not an unreasonable expectation but it is something of which we must be conscious.<\/p><p> We have been very progressive with the piloting of incentives for young farmers but there is no substitute for giving people a pathway they can see as financially secure.  The proof of the pudding here is the dairy sector, which has the youngest age profile in agriculture because it is seen as a reasonably secure area financially.  It is not exempt from the ups and downs of prices but that area can be contrasted with the area that sees most demographic challenges, which is the beef side.  That is for a good reason as well.  We must see how we can maximise support and incentivise that sector to ensure there are career opportunities for those who wish to take them.<\/p><p> I am aware of the Bord na M&oacute;na interest in aquaculture opportunities and there is great potential in those former Bord na M&oacute;na lands no longer subject to peat harvesting.  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy is aware that my Department has endeavoured in the past while to clear the backlog of aquaculture licence applications.  That has been a complicated task but I am glad to say that by the end of this year, we will meet the target of clearing the backlog.  We will be anxious to work, explore and assist in any way that the Department can with the proposals for aquaculture.  I am aware of other aquaculture endeavours that are based inland and that are quite successful.  There is no reason this could not be carried out successfully as a new enterprise in a post-peat environment in the midlands.  If my Department officials can be of any assistance in this regard, we would be willing to engage with the relevant parties.<\/p><p> I am aware of the number of people outside environmental schemes.  For example, people have exited the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, or will see their green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, contracts expiring within the transition period.  It is why we are looking to influence the regulation and ensure we can not just roll over those who will be in contract for a period of years yet but for those whose contracts expire or have expired already, we will be able to pilot new initiatives.  Those initiatives should be tailored to our circumstances no more than the previous schemes were foisted upon us.  It is clear that with the new dispensation and regulation for the CAP strategic plan, there will be much more emphasis on these schemes' outcomes, so we can measure in a tangible way what we are getting out for the financial support we are putting in.  That is compatible with the overall direction of travel in terms of the climate ambition within CAP and the fixed percentage for climate measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019121000002#C00800","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Is there a timeline to have the strategic plan in place?

As in previous years, a rigorous assessment has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the fixing of total allowable catches, TACs, for the coming year.  The EU Commission proposal was issued on 24 October and a number of \"non-papers\" updating the proposal have issued since.  As the committee will be aware, the final arrangements for 2020 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 16 and 17 December.  The levels of total allowable catch and the quotas for Ireland will be determined at that meeting, following intensive negotiations with member states and the EU Commission.<\/p> <p>  The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the European Union.  We have a duty of care to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  Ireland&rsquo;s total allocation of quotas in 2019 amounted to a total value of &euro;260 million.  There are also very valuable inshore species that are not subject to EU TACs, such as crab, whelk, scallop and lobster, and they are fished by the Irish fleet inside our six-mile coastal zone.<\/p> <p>  The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way.  The proposal covers stocks that are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks that are subject to ongoing international negotiations are not included in the proposal as yet.  The international coastal states mackerel negotiations concluded in October, with agreement on a 41% increase in mackerel quotas for 2020 in line with the scientific advice.<\/p><p>Mackerel is Ireland&rsquo;s single most valuable fishery and this increase represents a mackerel quota for Ireland of more than 78,000 tonnes, worth more than &euro;80 million directly to our catching sector for 2020.<br\/><br\/>Negotiations between the EU and Norway were completed last Friday.  The European Union total allowable catch, TAC, for blue whiting has not yet been finalised pending further negotiations between the EU and the Faroe Islands, which are taking place this week.  However, it is expected that there will be a small increase over 2019, with a quota of approximately 38,500 tonnes in 2020 for Ireland.  There will be a significant reduction in the TAC for horse mackerel - in the region of 40% - due to the state of the stock reflecting the scientific advice for this stock.The quotas for these stocks are not included in the Commission proposal or the sustainability impact assessment, SIA, as we must wait for the conclusion of all of the international agreements.<br\/><br\/>This year saw the full implementation of the landing obligation, or discards ban, which has been introduced on a phased basis over the period 2015 to 2019.  This is a central element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and was agreed by all member states as well as the European Parliament.  The full implementation of the landing obligation brings an end to the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  This is a common-sense goal and although the obligation comes with significant challenges, we will continue to work with it. <br\/><br\/>Another key feature of the Common Fisheries Policy is the setting of TAC and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield for all target stocks by 2020.  Maximum sustainable yield, or MSY, as it is more commonly known, is the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions.  In the EU as a whole, 59 stocks are fished at MSY levels in 2019, which has increased from 53 in 2018.  In 2009, only five stocks were fished at MSY levels.  This is a significant achievement and Ireland will continue to work with stakeholders, member states and the Commission to build on this tangible progress to achieve our objectives of healthy fish stocks and sustainable fishing.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to the proposals, they are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body responsible for advising on the state of fish stocks.  It also takes account of the views of the scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.<br\/><br\/>I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken to inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council.  An open consultation<b><\/b>process was initiated whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2020 to facilitate the assessment.  From 28 October 2018, an online web portal on <b><\/b>was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  This portal remained open until 22 November and five submissions were received by the closing date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on the <i>fishingnet.ie<\/i>website.  In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders &ndash; fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs<b>- <\/b>on 25 November.  The purpose of this meeting was to give a further opportunity to the main stakeholders to outline their positions on the many aspects of this proposal.  I thank all of the various stakeholders for their contributions to this impact assessment.  As always, there was a range of views among stakeholders.  However, there were also commonalities, and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process.  These include a call for adherence to the available scientific advice to enable responsible and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  This, however, must be balanced with the concern that major cuts to TACs could have severe socioeconomic impacts.<br\/><br\/>It is in that context that my clear position is that I will not support cuts unless I am satisfied that they are absolutely necessary and fully supported by rigorously assessed, clear scientific advice.  In its proposal, the Commission has identified the ongoing concerns about a number of by-catch stocks that are in poor biological state including Irish Sea whiting, Celtic Sea cod and plaice stocks, and west of Scotland cod and whiting.  We share those concerns as these stocks are important for our fishing fleet and we will continue to support measures that will help to rebuild these stocks.<br\/><br\/>The cod stock in the Celtic Sea is at a low level and ICES has recommended zero TAC for 2020.  The Commission has proposed a TAC for Celtic Sea cod of 189 tonnes, compared to 1,610 tonnes for 2019.  The reason for the low TAC proposal is because the biomass of stock is at a very low level, with poor recruitment since 2012.  The whiting stock in the Celtic Sea is also showing serious reductions in biomass and recruitment has been below average since 2014.  While the TAC level for whiting has not yet been proposed by the Commission because of linkages with the EU-Norway negotiations, it is expected to be reduced by some 40%.  I accept that we need to take a reduction in both the whiting and cod TACs but if the cod TAC, in particular, is set too low, it will lead to closure of all our whitefish fisheries where it is an unavoidable by-catch.<br\/><br\/>We need to take measures to reduce such by-catches and rebuild both important stocks.  The Commission has proposed a number of remedial measures for these cod and whiting stocks in the Celtic Sea.  The measures proposed include a closure of fishing grounds in the Celtic Sea from 1 February to 15 March 2020 during the spawning period and additional measures including CCTV monitoring systems on board vessels or observer coverage on vessels.  These measures will not apply to fishing vessels that adopt technical conservation measures involving mesh size increases and other modifications to fishing gear.  In addition, it provides for a mesh size increase for certain fisheries.  We are examining these proposals with our experts from BIM, our stakeholders and other impacted member states to understand the issues for our fleet.  We will support measures that improve gear selectivity and will be effectively rebuilding these stocks of cod and whiting.  We will seek some adjustment to these technical measures where there is a disproportionate impact on the fleet to ensure a balanced and effective suite of measures.  However, I am concerned about the proposal to introduce the specific measures relating to CCTV and observer coverage at such short notice as are all other member states in these fisheries.<br\/><br\/>Last week, the Commission proposed reduced TACs combined with additional measures - CCTV monitoring or observer coverage - for the by-catch TACs for whiting in the Irish Sea, cod and whiting in the north west, and plaice in part of the Celtic Sea.  We fully share the Commission&rsquo;s concern regarding these stocks and will support these reduced TACs but member states have concerns about the additional specific requirements that have not been considered in appropriate detail.  Apart from these issues, I also have concerns about some of the TAC level proposals, for example, the proposed cuts to pollock in the Celtic Sea and the north west of 40%.  Following the consultation process and the expert advice of the Marine Institute, I do not believe that the reduction in the TAC for pollock is either justified or necessary.<br\/><br\/>The ICES advice for one of our most important stocks, nephrops, or prawns, shows an increase in abundance in some areas but a reduction in others.  Last week, the Commission proposed a 15% reduction for nephrops in area 7.  The reduction reflects reductions in the biomass of the Aran Grounds and the Labadie Grounds off the south east coast of Ireland.  The important Porcupine fishery is stable for 2020 and the out-take limit remains the same as for 2019.<br\/><br\/>There is some good news in the proposal for certain stocks.  Monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea will be increased as will haddock in the Celtic Sea.  We are seeing a major problem with our herring stock in the Celtic sea, which has almost collapsed.  I am supportive of the Commission proposal to only allow a data collection commercial fishery in 2020 to allow for scientific monitoring purposes and to enable this important stock to rebuild.<br\/><br\/>This year, the Marine Institute and BIM have again made an invaluable contribution to the assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment before members today.  I will outline some of the findings contained in that assessment.  From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute's view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that there has been an improvement in the status of some fish stocks.  However, others remain a concern.  In the impact assessment, the Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2019 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in previous year's stock books.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks, at 35, and percentage, at 47%, in 2019 compared with last year.  The percentage, at 18%, and number of stocks, at 13, overfished has also increased in 2019 whereas the stocks with unknown status has remained at 26, or 35%.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the document that will be laid before the D&aacute;il and in the stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute and is available on its website.<br\/><br\/>The socioeconomic impact assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals does not fully account for Ireland&rsquo;s share of fishing opportunities. The current proposals exclude a number of important stocks - mackerel, horse mackerel and blue whiting - where the final European Union TACs depend on external, third country agreements.  If agreed as they currently stand, the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposal would see a net reduction in fishing opportunity - quotas of minus 13% by volume and minus 13% by value.<\/p><p>In financial terms, this amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;8.65 million.  These figures can be further explained, as follows.  A net reduction in fishing opportunity for the whitefish sector of minus 15% by volume and minus 14% by value, with a direct income reduction of minus &euro;8.25 million.  This does not take into account the proposed 15% reduction in the very important nephrops fishery, as the total allowable catch, TAC, for these stocks were not included in the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposal.  In regional analysis of Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and west coast stocks it is estimated that there will be a 14% decrease in fishing opportunities for the whitefish fleet.  This reduction is valued at &euro;5.35 million and will impact Kilmore Quay and Dunmore East.  In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income is also lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries such as net making, chandlery, engineering, refrigeration and so on.  This will obviously have a knock-on effect for employment and BIM further estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, that these reductions could impact 123 full and part-time jobs.  This could occur through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies in the seafood sector.<\/p><p> The proposals do not include the Hague preferences, which are a safety net for the Irish fleet on specific stocks where TACs are in decline.  Essentially, these are additional amounts of quota that Ireland and the UK claim for important whitefish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quota comes off their allocations.  Ensuring that the preferences are applied will be a key political objective in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2020 will amount to at least 1,216 tonnes of fish with a direct value of &euro;2.2 million.<\/p><p> To conclude, I can fully concur with the findings of the sea-fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  It highlights the significant impact that the current proposals could have on the Irish fishing industry.  Significant challenges lie ahead over the next two weeks but I will do my utmost to agree a fair and balanced package for Ireland that ensures the continued vibrancy of our industry and the long-term sustainability of our stocks.  Finally, I wish to thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of this impact assessment, and look forward to the debate on the conclusions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019121000002#D00700","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a very comprehensive opening statement.

It is concerning to see in respect of the whitefish sector in particular that a 15% reduction in volume and a value reduction of 14% are proposed, which would be &euro;8 million.  I note the BIM assessment has calculated an overall potential impact of 123 full and part-time jobs, as the Minister outlined.  Sustainability issues have to be a very important part of the Minister's considerations as well, in that we want to ensure that stocks are there long-term.  The Minister has outlined his objective in respect of getting a balanced outcome that tries to ensure, as far as possible, that no damage is done to the value and amount of catch.  I wish the Minister well in those negotiations.  He has an important role to carry out and it tends to be a very long night for his officials as well.  It will be particularly important in trying to ensure that the proposed cuts and the impact they would have on employment are addressed and averted if at all possible.  As Deputy Pringle mentioned in respect of the previous ICES advice, it seems that on more than one occasion in recent times, its assessment of levels of stock was off the mark.  In respect of mackerel in particular, that led to much reduced income for many of our mackerel fishermen.

I am sure he is well aware of the protest that took place at the gates of Leinster House yesterday in advance of this committee meeting.  There is a lot of concern and anger out there in respect of overfishing, not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and further afield.<\/p><p>The Minister's Department funds the Marine Institute to provide the scientific background to the Government's sustainable impact assessment of the Commission's proposal.  The Marine Institute report of 2019 stated that only 18% of stocks were overfished in 2019.  However, this assessment omits the 35% of stocks that are not subject to maximum sustainable yield evaluation.<\/p><p> First, will the Minister explain why the Marine Institute continues to provide a sustainability assessment that omits many of Ireland's most overfished stocks?  Second, the Minister's Department also funds Bord Iascaigh Mhara to provide to our Government the economic background to the Commission's proposals.

By driving overfishing, however, we contribute in a way to the overfishing of many stocks.  This threatens numerous fisheries with closure as soon as, perhaps, next year.

The biggest challenge for us will be the mixed fisheries.  Deputy Pringle, coming from where he does, probably understands this better than most.  Haddock stocks are strong but, as he said, haddock cannot be caught on its own.  One invariably ends up catching whiting or cod.  We acknowledge that those stocks are particularly challenged and we want to work with the Commission to find a way to enable us to catch species that are strong while not jeopardising the protection and preservation of cod and whiting in particular.<\/p> <p>  The issue of cod is interesting.  It does not just affect our waters.  Across the North Sea it has been a subject of other negotiations and measures.  I think the resolution to this will be technical measures.  The Irish fishing industry is quite proactive in that space.  There has been engagement between my Department and the industry to try to find a way that enables us to work with the industry.  I think this is the point Senator Hackett was making at the end of her observations on mixed fisheries.  If one accepts that, as Deputy Pringle rightly said, one cannot catch haddock without catching some other species, there must be some requirement for by-catch.  This is about adapting the technologies used, the nets and the mesh sizes.  These are technical measures.  In my time I have found the Irish industry to be among the most proactive in that space, and it is recognised as such.  We are working to try to make progress in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I will jump to one point Deputy Corcoran Kennedy made about herring.  All the advice is that this fishery is in considerable peril.  Though there was a quota, we have what is called the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee.  To give the industry credit where credit is due, when the fishery was opened, the industry came back and ordered its closure, stating that the fish were not there or that those that were there were juvenile and small.  The fishing industry itself makes this point.  It is illustrative of broader acknowledgement within the industry that the unsustainable exploitation of fishing stocks ultimately costs the industry itself.  The principle of maximum sustainable yield, MSY, will underpin these negotiations.  Significant progress has been made on fishing to maximum sustainable yield.  We have a distance to travel but the graph is moving substantially in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  I will make one other point about the economic impact to which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy alluded as well as BIM, etc.  I think BIM is acutely conscious of the impact of stock collapse.  The other presentation of its assessment today concerns simply what would happen if this results and if the proposals become the reality.  BIM does not take account of the Hague preferences.  It is important to restate what the Hague preferences are about.  They go back to the time of Garret FitzGerald's negotiations in the 1980s.  They were an acknowledgement of the UK and the Irish fishing industries' concerns and, in the context of a stock that is in decline and the stock that is available for distribution, our capacity to have a carve-out for the UK and Ireland.  The Hague preferences give us a lift.  It is not that this affects every other member state and we reach into the pond to take more.  The basis is the set advice, and we get a top-up that comes from other member states.  There is considerable resistance to the application of the Hague preferences at all December Council meetings.  The fact that the UK is leaving the EU will leave us much more isolated.  Believe me, the securing of the Hague preferences is the most contentious issue at every December Council meeting, not just, I suspect, in my experience but in the experience of every previous Minister with responsibility for fishing.  I imagine that with the UK leaving, fighting that battle for the Hague preferences will be a much lonelier endeavour, but so far so good insofar as they have been acknowledged.  As for the economic assessment, I do not think there is any doubt that everybody is attuned, not least to the Marine Institute and BIM, which do invaluable work, but also to the industry as to the consequences of fishing unsustainably.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the issue of the ICES advice for mackerel for 2019.  Once the ICES advice was revisited and revised upwards, we endeavoured to have that additional opportunity made available to the industry here and across Europe, but there was not a willingness at the Commission at that time to adhere to that.  It may well be reflective of the fact that the science even for this year is very strong in the context of a very substantial increase.  I do not want to interpret the science - that is for the Marine Institute to do - but it is very welcome that the ICES advice shows a very substantially increased opportunity for us in 2020.  The issue of the quality assurance of scientific advice has been commented on a lot since this issue arose.  We have been in the vanguard in conversations about quality assurance regarding the scientific advice.  ICES and its counterparts in all the other member states work to give the best independent advice available to them.  They collate it and give it to the Commission in respect of the opportunities that are there.  At all times, however, we need to be assured we are delivering the most accurate science.  That is something for the Marine Institute and ICES itself.  We have been active in that space in ensuring they learn from these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019121000002#G00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>With all respect, there is also the issue of ICES not talking to the fishermen about their views as to how the fishing stocks are holding up.<\/p><p>In the case of mackerel stocks, the fishermen have always been of the view that the stock is more than what the scientific advice said it is, and it has been shown today that they are right.

I am seeking the committee's approval for additional funds to contribute to the national funding element for the beef exceptional aid measure; approval to use savings on the Department's Vote to allow for extra expenditure for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS; to provide for an early payment to the World Food Programme; and for the addition of funding to my Department&rsquo;s administrative budget for its share of the substantial expenditures undertaken on border control posts in the past year in preparation for Brexit.  Taken together the additional funding allocations for subheads total some &euro;82 million, which we propose to be funded by &euro;19.4 million of additional voted funding, &euro;22 million in savings across other subheads and &euro;41 million in additional appropriations-in-aid.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2019 voted allocations, it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.<\/p> <p>  The various additional costs and the areas where savings have emerged reflect the dynamic uncertain environment in which the sector and Department have operated this year, most of which has been related either directly or indirectly to Brexit or, more particularly, the threat of Brexit.  It was certainly not a business as usual year, but we have also done our usual business.  It is a measure of the scale of the challenge that we have spent substantial public funds on new infrastructure, staff, IT systems and schemes to support our farmers in this difficult period.  By the same token, the additional funds we are seeking for TAMS points to our farmers' resilience and deep commitment, and their readiness to invest in their own enterprises in the knowledge that improved safety and efficiency is vital in the more competitive environment we face, regardless of how Brexit plays out.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline proposed savings, starting with the payroll saving of &euro;2 million.  To date in 2019, a total of 426 people have joined or rejoined the Department and 215 have retired or moved to other employment.  Despite this substantial increase in staff, there is a slight saving on the payroll  - about 1% of the allocation - because a substantial part of it was in the last third of the year and was due to an intense focus on recruitment and organisation in preparation for Brexit activities.  Savings of &euro;2.5 million in the food safety, animal and plant health, and animal welfare areas reflects reasonably benign conditions in some areas.  More specifically, the prudent provision funding on control of horses and measures for diseases other than tuberculosis, TB, will not be fully used.  Also, the drawdown of funds set aside for the farmer payments for sheep electronic identification has been lower than provided.<\/p> <p>  In the other scheme subhead, there are total savings of &euro;1 million available for redistribution because the provision set aside for the residual payments under the 2018 fodder schemes was not fully required.  In the development and promotion of agriculture and food subhead there are savings of &euro;4 million on the capital side and &euro;2.9 million on the current side.  An underspend arose as spend on lean reviews by food companies was substantially lower than projected and there was a very low demand for the capital investment incentive scheme.  The specialist artisan food producer scheme had substantial numbers of approvals issued but a small portion of these have reached payment stage.  There is a capital saving of &euro;3 million within the Teagasc allocation where the provision for the national food innovation hub will be underused due to the delayed start to construction works, which has reduced capital drawdown.<\/p> <p>  In the other services subhead, a saving of &euro;1.6 million has arisen mainly due to savings in our legal provisions.  In the research, quality and certification subhead there will be a saving of &euro;2.9 million.  The 2019 provision was primarily required to meet funding commitments arising from expenditure incurred in previously awarded projects and for new commitments under the 2019 call that was launched in March but which had a lower than anticipated participation level.<\/p> <p>  There are savings of &euro;1.6 million available in the fisheries subhead due mainly to timing of payments to be made in respect of multi-year projects under way in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, marine biodiversity scheme and the blue growth and marine spatial planning scheme.  There is also a saving of &euro;500,000 available from the Marine Institute&rsquo;s superannuation allocation.<\/p> <p>  Taken together, these &euro;22 million in savings described are to be combined with additional gross provisions of just over &euro;60 million to provide &euro;32 million for farm schemes, &euro;30 million for Brexit infrastructure and &euro;20 million for the World Food Programme.  I will describe these briefly.  The &euro;32 million extra to be provided for farm schemes would be distributed to the agri-environment schemes subhead for GLAS, the Department's subhead for TAMS and the beef sustainability schemes subhead for the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM.<\/p> <p>  The BEAM was introduced to provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland and is subject to the conditions set out in European Commission implementing regulation.  The BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support and is provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty.  The scheme was designed to target aid to those who had been most impacted by the market disturbance for which it was requested.  The final prepayment checks are still in progress but we envisage that up to &euro;78 million will be paid, of which &euro;28 million will be an Exchequer cost, and a very small part will fall into next year.  I am seeking &euro;18 million in additional funds and this will be complemented by other savings, mostly by &euro;8 million from the other schemes within the beef sustainability scheme subhead, namely, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, and the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP.  While the BEEP participation levels were slightly lower than we had provided for, at 13,289 participants, it has had a very successful pilot year, which we intend to build on for next year.<\/p> <p>  The 2019 budgetary allocations for current expenditure under the agri-environment schemes amount to &euro;228.25 million.  The expenditure projections were based on paying schemes at the 75% advance rate set out in the EU regulatory framework.  Owing to the difficult circumstances experienced by farmers, I made a request to the European Commission for approval for Ireland to pay a higher advance payment of 85% for Pillar 2 rural development schemes, which is allowed under EU regulations in exceptional circumstances.  Accordingly, I am also requesting the committee's approval for funding of a further &euro;7 million to ensure sufficient funding is available to pay a higher advance payment of 85% funding to all farmers who establish their eligibility under these schemes.  At this point, we have already paid 43,000 participants their advance payment.  This is the highest number of GLAS participants and the additional funding we seek will bring the number paid by the year end to about 45,200 participants, who we would envisage being eligible at year end.<\/p> <p>  On the capital side, I am heartened that despite all the challenges and uncertainties faced by the sector, participation in TAMS continues to grow and I am seek to allocate it an additional &euro;7 million to allow for the continuation of payments of claims over the next few weeks because the &euro;70 million funding for 2019 is now exhausted.<\/p> <p>  Apart from these farmer schemes, there is a need for substantial extra funding for the non-pay administration part of programme A.  This is for border control posts, which arise in the context of Brexit.  It reflects the requirement to have property and infrastructure to facilitate and support the movement of legitimate trade and carry out necessary sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks at ports on the basis of a disorderly withdrawal from the European Union by the United Kingdom.  My Department is the lead tenant in most parts of the Dublin Port and Rosslare sites and has been assigned the largest proportion of the considerable costs involved, amounting to some &euro;28.1 million in capital and &euro;2.3 million in current expenditure.  This is largely undertaken on our behalf by the Office of Public Works, OPW.<\/p> <p>  The other very important item is the additional &euro;20 million allocation for the World Food Programme, which will allow for the earliest payment of next year&rsquo;s commitment under Ireland&rsquo;s strategic partnership agreement with the programme.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the World Food Programme&rsquo;s executive director who has written to inform me that this funding will significantly contribute to enhance the programme's capability to plan its interventions and better address needs around the world.<\/p> <p>  My Department's appropriations-in-aid are set to be substantially greater in 2019 than provided for in the 2019 Revised Estimates Volume.  We are seeking to offset some of our additional requests for funding against the &euro;41 million of these extra receipts.  These payments are from the European Commission and are the EU funding component for our co&ndash;funded rural development programme schemes.  These are paid in arrears by the Commission, usually on a quarterly basis.  The additional receipts reflect an underestimation of receipts in respect of advance payments made under the areas of natural constraint, ANC, in September.  As this was not in our budgeted amount for the year, our 2019 receipts will be greater than planned.<\/p> <p>  This is a necessary, far-reaching and substantive Supplementary Estimate, which I earnestly recommend to the committee for support.  I will be pleased to respond to any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#B00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

That has been a constant during the Minister's stewardship of the Department.  The underspend varies from &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million to over &euro;100 million.  It is now December and the Minister is coming forward with Supplementary Estimates.  What will happen when those figures are published some time in 2020?  Will there be another underspend across the overall Department Vote?<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a few different matters.  The BEAM scheme, which was co-funded by the Department and the European Commission, only covered the period from September last year to May of this year.  Only half of the Department's national Exchequer contribution to that scheme was used up due to an underspend.  There was a particular underspend in the suckler sector as opposed to the fattening sector.  The Minister presented a rationale to the European Commission, which it accepted, that the BEAM scheme needed to cover the period from September until May because of the very high losses incurred by farmers during that time.  Given that losses post May were even higher, and given that only half the national Exchequer allocation was used, the Minister has no defence for not returning to Europe to seek an additional scheme to support the beef sector due to the traumatic year it has had income-wise.  That needs to be addressed.  The Minister should be reallocating some funding in order to get an extension to that BEAM scheme, flawed as it was, at European level.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the rural development programmes.  Could the Minister give us a synopsis of where he is at regarding the likely spends across the various schemes, as well as the outlined overall commitment to those schemes?  We are behind the curve on a number of them, including the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the beef data genomics programme and the organic farming scheme, which had a significant number of applicants, the majority of whom were refused again.  There was an underspend of &euro;8 million in the organic farming scheme.  Given that a transitionary period will be in place post 2020, and given that we need to continue many of our Pillar 2 schemes, I ask the Minister to address the matter of farmers coming out of the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, who are blocked from GLAS as it is not accepting new applicants.  As a result, a significant number of farmers cannot currently apply for any environmental schemes.  That is a very poor harbinger for what might happen in 2021, as we are not facilitating those farmers entering an environmental scheme at the moment.  I would not want that to become the form in 2021, when many farmers in GLAS 1 will have received their final payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#C00100","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to &euro;22 million in savings, which are to be combined with additional gross provisions of just over &euro;60 million to provide &euro;32 million for farm schemes and &euro;30 million for Brexit infrastructure.  The Minister mentioned border posts, which I take to refer to the ports of Rosslare and Dublin.  What about other ports?  What are the implications for that &euro;30 million the Minister is seeking?  Will there be implications for border infrastructure along the land border as well?<\/p> <p>  I was surprised about the savings made from the control of horses, because there is a huge problem with the control of horses in this State.  There was a saving of &euro;2.5 million due to lower demand for the control of horses, electronic sheep identification and measures relating to other diseases.  I do not know about the sheep electronic identification but the Minister might outline the current situation regarding the control of horses, because there is some confusion, particularly at local authority level, about microchipping, what powers they have, and so on.  I do not expect the Minister to go into it because these are Estimates, but he might give us an overview.  Horse welfare is a huge problem, as are stray horses.  It has been a huge problem in recent years, though I can only speak for my own constituency.  I still encounter problems with horse control, horse welfare and horses having to be impounded.<\/p> <p>  Provision for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, has gone up by 8.9%, which people have welcomed.  I wanted to ask the Minister about the issue of microgeneration, which I have been pushing for a long time.  Is there provision in TAMS this year, or will there be in the coming year, to get farmers involved in microgeneration, such as solar, small-scale biogas, or wind power?  <\/p> <p>  The organic farming scheme has been oversubscribed and there has been much lobbying around it.  We have to get a higher return from our food, and 90% of our vegetables are imported.  Some of that cannot be avoided due to our wet climate, but some of it can be.  How can we reopen the organic farming scheme and put in extra funding for it?

They often end up increasing rates that ordinary little shops cannot carry, to try to provide money.  I saw it happening in my own county.  The welfare of animals is very important.

I know farmers have written to the Department in recent weeks to withdraw from the scheme, including farmers with whom I have been in contact.  I have spoken to Teagasc advisers and they reckon there will be a significant withdrawal.  I have spoken to a farmer in partnership with his father who is not from my area but who runs a suckler beef enterprise, with progeny between 21 and 24 months, a 100% spring calving system, sustainable grass-based production, a six-week spring calving rate of 89%, a 90% rate of heifers calving down between 22 and 26 months, a rate of 0.292 calves per cow per year and a calving interval of 380 days, which is 21 days better than the national average.  This family are members of the local Teagasc knowledge transfer, KT, discussion group and have been active members long before the beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, and the KT programme started and all those programmes were beneficial to them.  They started an increased stocking rate on the advice of Teagasc, they built extra animal housing, they went to the Department and got funded through TAMS and they gained approval for a proposal to proceed to build accommodation for 60 suckler cows.  The investment allowed them to increase their herd by about 20 cows to around 100.  Increasing herd size is critical for receiving funding from the lending institutions and for the TAMS development.  They have a sustainable system.  They were struggling financially with the farm and they had merchant's credit which they would have had to carry forward into 2020 due to poor previous financial history.  That was unprecedented and the beef crisis has hit their farm, just like many other farms.  They applied for the beef exceptional aid measure because this was an exceptional period in their farming careers and the compensation was badly needed to help pay off their creditors.  Their major concern was the 5% reduction in organic bovine manure nitrogen- based fertiliser from 30 June 2019.  They had been building numbers during this time, as could clearly be seen in the Irish Cattle and Beef Federation, ICBF, reports and the 5% reduction to take place between July 2020 and June 2021 would mean a 20% reduction in their herd because they had been building stock numbers since then and building a sustainable farm system, based on Teagasc advice and funded by the Department through the TAMS.  However, now they are being asked to reduce their stock by 5%, which will reverse their farm back to where it was five years ago and leave them with an unsustainable system, as described earlier.  They requested that the Department not to impose this reduction and to allow the beef exceptional aid measure to be used for what it was meant to be used, namely, compensating farmers for poor beef prices and helping beef farmers to survive during such a crisis.  That case was sent to the Department.  This was a partnership of a young man joining his father on the farm business.<\/p> <p>  The upshot of it is this case was sent to the Department on 24 September and my information is they never received a reply.  I would not mind that because I brought this case up in the D&aacute;il but I have just heard confirmation they have since withdrawn from the scheme as they did not want to receive payments when they would have to pay the money back.  That is how the glorified BEAM scheme is working.  These are two exceptional farmers in a father and son partnership.  Can the Minister tell me how good the scheme is for the likes of them?  I have checked with two Teagasc advisers today and they expect more people to withdraw from the scheme on this basis.  These are knowledgeable Teagasc advisers who have been working hard on the ground to try to improve the lot of farmers.  I brought this matter up in the D&aacute;il in October and I knew this would come to pass.  I am disappointed that something I brought up in good faith has not even got a hearing, never mind anything else.  A suggestion the Minister made to me stuck with me, although he might have only said it to me as an aside, perhaps in the D&aacute;il.  He said they could change their system of buying and selling.  Mother of God - I will not even address that point.  I just want to register the point that this scheme was worthwhile and an excellent scheme in many ways but it has this problem that it does not allow an exception for young farmers who have engaged in a growth phase.  Just when they are building up their stock, they are hit and put back again, particularly when they would have given commitments to financial institutions and others during that growth phase.<\/p> <p>  It is great to see the various schemes being introduced and I welcome the various allocations the Minister has outlined.  The final year for a lot of those CAP-backed schemes, such as the BDGP and the GLAS will be 2020.  What is planned for farmers for the future?  Where does the Minister see things going when these schemes come to an end?  I know that will depend on the 2020 CAP reform budget.  Does the Minister envisage significant transitional arrangements to keep the show running while those three or four other countries decide whether they will contribute to an increased CAP budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#D00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>On that point, the Minister is giving us a briefing on CAP in the joint committee meeting later if that is any use to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#D00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I might not be around.

I have no problem with where the excess expenditure is targeted to go or anything like that.  How does the Department decide which schemes get the additional funding and which schemes do not?  It has been mentioned by other members but I am particularly thinking of the organic farming scheme, which had 111 applications, of which only 55 were successful.  Despite having scored over the amount of points the Department required, the unsuccessful applications were not funded.  I can see the increase in funding to the GLAS, the TAMS and to every other scheme.  They have got funding so I wonder why the organic farming scheme was not supported because it is a worthwhile scheme for the direction we need to go in to deal with climate change.  It is positive there was such a large request for people to take up the organic farming scheme and it is frustrating for those people to see they meet the criteria in the points system the Department set down but that the Department does not then fund them.  That is difficult for them to accept.  How was the decision arrived at not to fund the organic farming scheme but to fund these other schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#D00600","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I want to make a few points to the Minister and his officials.  Like Deputy Penrose, I cannot believe this line in the Minister's opening statement: \"More specifically, the prudent provision funding on control of horses\".  In my county, the control of horses is a serious issue.  The week before last, three constituents contacted me about serious welfare issues with single horses and groups of horses.  Our local authorities say they do not have the funding to deal with this issue and then I see this statement about: \"the prudent provision funding\".  I requested on two or three occasions for officials from the Department to come in here and be honest with us about how they will deal with horse welfare this winter.  We thought they would be in before Christmas but that has been put off until the new year.<\/p><p>When I read that sentence, I can understand why the officials are not coming in to explain what they are doing as regards horse welfare.  <\/p><p> Like other speakers, refer to the organic scheme.  As much as 70% of applicants were ineligible and there was an underspend of &euro;8 million.  Beef farmers have contacted me about the scheme.  They told me that no matter what they did to comply with the conditions of the scheme they could not get the necessary points to qualify.  Similar to BEAM, a scheme was designed to exclude farmers.  Beef farmers have told me that they have spent money on their applications but because of the way the scoring is applied, they could not reach the points necessary - in excess of 71.5 - to qualify for the scheme.  In fact, the maximum score that they could get, as beef farmers, was 70 points.  It is ridiculous to have a scheme that automatically excludes applicants and that has an underspend.  <\/p><p> On the BEAM scheme, beef farming incomes are in crisis and it is in excusable to fail to spend &euro;28 million of Exchequer funding in a year like this.  A total of 13,800 farmers who killed cattle were excluded because they had another enterprise on their farms.  We made the point at the time that this was wrong.  Being forced to reduce one's stocking rate to qualify means many small suckler farmers and young farmers have walked away from the scheme.  It defies explanation that that there a failure to distribute &euro;28 million in funding to badly pressed farmers who are under severe income pressure.<\/p><p> Last week, a farmer told me that he sold his cattle at a mart and they were slaughtered within 30 days of him selling them.  Unfortunately, the dealer received the money, not the farmer.  The conditions of BEAM have failed farmers.  The dealer sold the cattle on to a factory using an ordinary herd number.  Even though the farmer believed that he would qualify for the scheme, he was excluded.  The money, again, went to factory agents instead of the farmer.<\/p><p> There was no mention of additional funding to speed up the processing of licences for the forestry sector.  The sector is grinding to a halt, which we have discussed on a number of occasions.  Only 50% of the targets for planing have been met while the availability of licences for thinning and felling trees has also ground to a halt.  There is a serious need for additional resources to speed up the issuing of licences.  The industry is suffering due to the lack of licences for thinning and felling trees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#D00700","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Has consideration been given to allowing contractors to qualify for TAMS? given there is a major emphasis on slurry spreading equipment from a climate change point of view?

Deputy McConalogue alluded to an underspend.  On the contrary, we will require more money to keep the show on the road.  We have secured that agreement from the Department of Finance and now seek ratification for that by the committee, which was the case in 2018.  For two successive years we are spending more than we were originally allocated rather than underspending.<\/p><p>There have been years the Department has underspent and overspent.  The notion that a Department can land right on the button when it comes to a budget of such magnitude does not take account of the many variables that happen.  Sometimes we get appropriations-in-aid back early but sometimes they are delayed and, therefore, go into the next year.  Sometimes we have new schemes for which we must find funding.  A host of variables have an impact but we always endeavour that we issue as much money as possible to farmers, and to do that this year, we require additional funds, as we did last year.<\/p><p>I want to deal with a number of common themes, the first of which relates to the conditionality of BEAM.  The beef sector has come through a very difficult time and, in many respects, it continues.  The objective was to get funding from the Commission and the Exchequer to devise a scheme that would pay farmers as quickly as possible but that comes with terms and conditions.  Regarding what Deputy Penrose said, the EU Commission is responsible for the implementing regulation.  The following conditionality is stitched into the EU's regulation:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe measures taken by Ireland shall be aimed at reducing production or restructuring the beef and veal sector and one or more of the following objectives:  \t(a) implementation of quality schemes in the beef and veal sector or projects aiming at promoting quality and value added;<br \/><br \/>(b) boosting market diversification; and <br \/><br \/>(c) protecting and improving the farmers&rsquo; environmental, climate and economic sustainability.  <\/blockquote> <p>We did not have a choice because we had one of three options that &quot;shall be aimed at reducing production or restructuring the beef and veal sector&quot;.  We were faced with the choice in terms of complying with that rejecting the aid or coming up with an ingenuous way to enable farmers to qualify.  I did not want to have a conditionality attached where there was a straight requirement for a head count reduction.  We assessed whether there was room for manoeuvre when negotiating the organics load.  That is the way we went about it and we opted for a 5% reduction.  That was the best way to deal with a difficult hand of cards.  There was conditionality attached to the funding, as there always is for any scheme of exceptional aid.  Some people felt hard done by and have left the scheme as a consequence.  Of just under 35,000 applicants, approximately 500 people have left so there is a liability in the region of &euro;78 million.  It was a demand-led scheme.<\/p><p>Deputy Cahill mentioned that dealers engineered their mart sales to be subsequently sold on using another herd number.  That claim flies in the face of the facts.  In late summer, the scheme was introduced for cattle that been sold prior to last May so the dealers could not have known, as they sold the cattle, that it would be appropriate to buy them using a dealer's herd number and sell them using another herd number.  That is simply fictitious and it is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#E00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Why do dealers not sell their cattle using their dealer number?

Sometime a contract starts in the middle of one stream and rolls over into the next one.  If anything we are generally overspending under RDP rather than underspending.  We will certainly spend all of the &euro;56 million available for the organic sector.<\/p> <p>  We asked an expert group within the organic sector to consider which interventions might be useful.  That group recommended a targeted reopening of the organic scheme.  The targeted areas in which it asked this were in horticulture, cereals and dairy.  We accepted applications that were in those areas but rejected many others because they were not.  We accepted applications from the areas identified by the expert group as areas with market demand where it would be useful to intervene and offer support.  The problem is that the organic beef sector is leaking into the mainstream beef market.  It does not have sufficient marketing or organisation.  There is a huge demand for more organic cereals.  I could give examples of places I have visited and very successful organic businesses I have seen up and running.  We are importing organic grains because we do not meet domestic demand here.  That is why we opened the scheme in the targeted area of cereals as we did for horticulture and dairy.  In the context of the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, we are coming from quite a low base.  I think we have 2,000 ha under these crops.  I am not sure.  I had better not quote a figure I cannot stand over.

I imagine the first of those will be considered imminently by the forestry appeals process shortly.  It is an area of concern.  We are very aware of it in the Department.

The potential exists that people will have to be let go.  There must be an urgent change to the number of licences being issued for felling and also in terms of the logjam arising in respect of planting.  There seems to be a very serious situation in the sector, which is putting a massive amount of pressure on those who have invested in it in terms of contractors and also the sawmills.  Recently, sawmills have been importing wood and raw material from Scotland to ensure they have a throughput to keep going but that option is not available to those working in the sector in planting or felling.  A clear pathway needs to be put in place to ensure that the industry is operating at capacity and that we do not have redundancies in the sector.  It appears to me that unless urgent is taken by the Minister and the Department, that will be the situation facing them.

We have had some comparable experience in this area in terms of the aquaculture licensing issue.  I would hope that where we are now in terms of the additional resources that we have and are putting into it in terms of additional staff and rebuilding the licensing system will address the issues.  As the Deputy rightly said, whether one is employed in the afforestation side, the nursery side, in the contracting business of building forestry roads, the felling system or working in one of the many processing plants across the country, there is a consequence all along the supply chain for these actions that have been taken.  We have had to deal with that and those court challenges and put in place a new licensing regime that takes account of those court rulings.  I am hopeful but we await the deliberations of the appeals board on those licences that were issued under the new regime but appealed.

They have been refused.  First, we were told the person who would be paid was the last person with a herd number who bought the cattle at the mart, but we find out now that is not what is happening.  There is no real answer forthcoming.  It seems that no one is entitled to get it if a dealer or mart supplied the cattle to the factory within the 30 days, and yet the farmers are not being paid and are being told that they will not be paid.  We cannot understand the reason for this.<\/p> <p>  My other question may have been dealt with.  It concerns felling licences and the building of roads.  There has been an unseemly delay with the issuing of felling licences all year.  The system has been completely held up in every aspect, including as it relates to contractors and farmers.  The Minister referred to it.  There is a bad feeling out there.  In addition, serial objectors are delaying the building of roadways to bring out timber.  Can anything be done in respect of such individuals?  They should be obliged to pay a reasonable sum of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;3,000 in view of the fact that they are holding up work.  One farmer I know is disabled as a result of a stroke and his family needs the money from the sale of the timber but they cannot build a road in order to get the timber out.  That is very wrong.  It does not encourage people who are thinking of going into forestry but rather it is steering them away from it.  Could we do anything to prevent people making serial objections?  I do not know what is the reason for it.  Does the Minister or anyone else know why these individuals take it upon themselves to stop people building roads in order to bring out timber?

Despite the substantial increase in staff, there is a slight saving on the payroll side of approximately 1% of the allocation.  A substantial part of it was in the final third of the year due to an intensive focus on recruitment due to Brexit-related requirements.  That is the reason for the saving.  It is not an enormous saving, it is only 1%.<\/p> <p>  There were two schemes in the marine area.  One was the marine biodiversity scheme in 2019.  Expenditure on that has been slightly lower than anticipated.  There was a provision of &euro;2.8 million and there is a saving of approximately &euro;900,000.  That is because of a timing issue with contractual commitments under the scheme.  The other scheme is that relating to blue growth and marine spatial planning.  Expenditure on that amounted to &euro;3.1 million.  However, expenditure in 2019 amounts to &euro;1.5 million because many projects in the blue growth and marine spatial planning work programme that are approved span a number of years, which means the drawdown will not all happen before the end of this year.<\/p> <p>  I dealt with both of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's points.  I discussed the matter with the Deputy.  I appreciate his concerns.  We will pay &euro;78 million to farmers this year under the scheme.  We gave a commitment that the scheme would be for farmers not for dealers or anybody else.  That is something I stand over.  The point the Deputy raises concerns cattle that were sold in a mart and subsequently sold by the purchaser on to a factory within a month.  All I can say with regard to the design of the scheme is that no dealer will qualify for that payment.  If the cattle were bought by another farmer and sold within a month, then that is another thing, then the farmer who sold them is eligible but no dealer herd number will be eligible for the payment.  It is the case that some cattle were bought by dealers and some were bought by other farmers and sold within a month so the entitlement then rests with the final seller, but the dealer will not get the payment.<\/p> <p>  I dealt with felling licences in some detail earlier.  We appreciate that there is a significant challenge and we have been engaged with all of the actors along the chain from contractors, nursery owners and the forestry industry generally in terms of its representative body and various individual actors along the line to hear their concerns at first hand, to explain the challenges we face as a consequence of the licences that were challenged successfully.  We had to rebuild our licensing system.  I hope the new licences are more robust now, having been constructed to take account of the reasons licences fell in court.  In respect of what we are licensing today, in terms of afforestation, it is a very different product and product mix than the forestry many people are exercised and animated about.  It is a very different plantation regime now than was in place ten, 15, 20 or 30 years ago.  The idea of forestry being built right up to one's back yard or to the edge of a roadway is no longer something that is tolerated.  We put a great deal of effort into rebuilding the licensing regime and I hope that it proves to be more robust in terms of the appeals process that some of them are being subjected to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019121000002#H01700","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>If there are no more questions, we will wrap up.

The invitation came just before we made announcements on our revised strategy, but the indicated topics the committee asked us to discuss, around the future funding of public service media and the value for money of our indigenous and acquired programming, are important and timely considerations.<br\/><br\/>First, let me address the Report on the Future Funding of Public Service Broadcasting, published by this committee in November 2017.  As members will recall, we welcomed not only the findings of this report but also the depth and breadth of the committee&rsquo;s research, engagement and consideration of this topic.  The report was based on original research, data analysis, a wide-ranging stakeholder consultation, a full day&rsquo;s conference and debate, and substantial discussion and consideration by the committee members.  The report made a number of clear and well-informed recommendations that were widely accepted and endorsed within the broader media sector.<br\/><br\/>In 2018, a decision was taken by the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, to set up yet another working group to look at the future funding of public service broadcasting, and the findings of that group were presented to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, earlier this year.  In August 2019, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, made a formal statement in this regard, acknowledging the importance of the protection of public service broadcasting, stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPublic service broadcasting is more important now than ever.  Independent, objective reporting of domestic and international affairs is crucial. <\/blockquote> <p>He also acknowledged that audiences were increasingly moving online for their media consumption and that the licence fee system would need to adapt accordingly.  However, the remedy proposed was that the licence fee collection would be put out to tender and that the term of contract would be for a five-year period.  Given that the collecting agent would likely be contracted from 2021 onward, this would, in effect, delay the transition to a media charge for close to seven years from the point of announcement.  That is completely untenable.<br\/><br\/>Evasion is now almost 13%, resulting in the loss of some &euro;25 million per year.  By virtue of outdated legislation, a further 11% of households, and the figure is growing, do not pay the television licence and yet can consume public service programming on their online devices.  By way of example, for the recent Ireland <i>v<\/i>. Russia Rugby World Cup match, we had near equivalent viewership on the RT&Eacute; Player live streaming as we had watching the match on RT&Eacute; 2.  This lag in legislation is resulting in a further loss of &euro;20 million in public funding annually.  Licence fee receipts are down against forecast for this year, and have been for the past number of months, making a difficult financial situation even more acute for us and for the industry.  Ireland&rsquo;s television licence system is irrevocably broken and is no longer capable of properly sustaining public service broadcasting or Ireland&rsquo;s broader audiovisual and creative sector.<br\/><br\/>All that said, against this reality, RT&Eacute; is clear that it must also take action to change to remain sustainable and relevant for Irish audiences.  RT&Eacute; has already made significant changes to the organisation in recent years, but the way media is being consumed by audiences everywhere is changing and we need to evolve even further if we are to meet audience needs effectively.  The challenges that lie ahead are many and include the following.  With regard to global trends, the media landscape worldwide is changing at a pace that has exceeded all forecasts.  The rise of the media superpowers and the potential impact on dilution of national culture within a small country like Ireland should be a matter of real concern.  The next challenge concerns audience shifts and patterns.<\/p><p>Audiences, especially younger people, are changing the way that they select and access media, and we need to meet these audiences where they expect to find us, especially in terms of our online services.  Wide-ranging budget adjustments are required to stabilise RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s finances and ensure increased investment to deliver the type of service and content that we know our audiences want.  This means creating greater efficiencies within the operating costs, new work practices, more efficient use of the regional studios and other pay-cost related measures.  As I have said on a number of occasions, it is not possible for RT&Eacute; to continue to operate from a position of deficit.  We need to reduce projected costs by &euro;60 million over the next three years.  This is in addition to the reductions of 23% on operating costs achieved between 2008 and 2018.  To be clear, many of these changes need to happen and will happen irrespective of licence fee reform.  RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s programming and service choices will also need to be refreshed and be under constant review to ensure that these remain relevant and impactful for audiences.  This leads me to this committee's secondary point of interest, namely, value for money and indigenous and acquired programming.<br\/><br\/>The current licence fee costs the equivalent of 44 cent per day, of which RT&Eacute; receives the lions&rsquo; share, with the BAI's sound and vision scheme also receiving support.  For this 44 cent per day, RT&Eacute; delivers<b><\/b>comprehensive local, national and international news in both English and Irish.  We retain the largest network of regional correspondents of any media outlet in the country.  We also provide dedicated reporting from London, Brussels and the US.  RT&Eacute; provides all Irish language television news for both RT&Eacute; and TG4.  In terms of investigative reporting, this year alone RT&Eacute; has brought to public attention investigations into cr&egrave;che standards and regulation, animal welfare issues within the greyhound industry, child sexual abuse allegations in certain scouting organisations, and challenges to the regulatory standards by some quarry companies and their impact on the Irish landscape.<br\/><br\/>We have covered essential national moments on a free-to-air basis, from the big wins at tournaments such as the Rugby World Cup in Japan, the GAA finals in Croke Park, the Irish women&rsquo;s hockey win in Donnybrook and the women&rsquo;s Rugby World Cup journey this summer.<br\/><br\/>Culture Night, Wexford Opera and next year&rsquo;s Galway 2020 partnership are all testimony to our support and commitment to the promotion of national arts and culture, as is our ongoing RT&Eacute; Supporting the Arts scheme, which promotes and supports approximately 150 arts and culture events throughout the country each year.<br\/><br\/>We can shine a spotlight on key public issues such as health and well-being with shows like &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s Fittest Family&quot; and &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;; the value of family, community and the development and well-being of children through a series like &quot;Raised by the Village&quot;; or the recent focus on climate change with RT&Eacute; 's climate week, culminating in a debate in this house with young people from every constituency in the country, which was a global first.<br\/><br\/>RT&Eacute; hosts Ireland&rsquo;s only national dedicated Irish language radio service, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, and the strengthening of our broadcast partnership with TG4.<br\/><br\/>We offer a wide ranging celebration of music of all forms<b>,<\/b>from the Choice music partnership and the 2FM Rising initiative, the 2FM Studio 8 sessions, and Other Voices, all of which support and promote new young Irish acts.  We provide support for traditional music through Ceili House on Radio 1 and the recently launched Irish Folk Awards, and for classical music through Lyric FM, and the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra&rsquo;s Music in the Classroom initiative, to name just a few.<br\/><br\/>We support discussion and debate, whether that is on any one of our radio service which reach more than 2 million listeners each week, with audience participation programmes such as &quot;Liveline&quot; with Joe Duffy or &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot;, or the topical discussions that feature on flagship entertainment programmes such as &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.  All of these programmes elevate awareness and engagement on the topics that matter most to Irish audiences every day.  Beyond these, RT&Eacute; provides many more moments of entertainment, celebration, revelation and reflection.<br\/><br\/>It is fair to say that aforementioned represents good value for 44 cent a day per household, especially in comparison with the subscription costs to other media services, none of which offers anywhere near this level of Irish perspective or output.  In terms of value, it is also useful to compare RT&Eacute;'s spend and services with other international public service media providers.  In terms of our nearest counterpart, BBC 1 costs were &pound;1.106 billion and BBC 2 costs were &pound;381 million, consuming the bulk of the &pound;1.678 billion spent by BBC on its television output in 2018.  All of RT&Eacute;'s services are delivered for less than the BBC spends on its secondary television channel.  The total revenue available to the Norwegian public service media provider NRK is &euro;600 million while the Finnish public broadcasting service YLE revenue in 2018 was &euro;475 million.  RT&Eacute; is providing a public service offering of equivalence with much less revenue.  There is no doubt that national media services are struggling with the haemorrhaging of commercial income to the large-scale digital players in particular.  This should be a matter of concern for all of us.  It is a false comparison to perceive RT&Eacute; as being exempt from that struggle or well-off by comparison.  Our remit is different, our responsibilities are greater, and our costs reflect that.<br\/><br\/>There will always be things that our audiences would like to see us offer more or less of, depending on personal tastes and interests, but in overall terms, RT&Eacute; offers a broad range of services with good levels of cost efficiency.  RT&Eacute; has exercised significant cost control, resulting in its 2018 costs being almost 25% lower than a decade ago.  While RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s costs in the past three years have increased by a modest 6%, this reflects increases in the cost of making programmes and in the cost of competitive rights, both of which outstrip typical inflation, as well as significant public service obligations.  Cost efficiency is routinely scrutinised by our regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and on more than one occasion by NewERA.  On each evaluation, the organisation has met the metrics and the standards that were set.<br\/><br\/>The following is the breakdown of acquired programming versus home-produced programming within RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s overall output and spend.  In RT&Eacute; One, the total spend on indigenous Irish programming was &euro;110.4 million and the spend on acquired programming, including a portion of spend to Irish acquisitions, was &euro;14.7 million or approximately 12% of the overall spend.  In RT&Eacute; 2, the total spend on local programming was &euro;42.2 million and the spend on acquired programming was &euro;9.5 million or approximately 18% of the overall total of &euro;51.7 million.  RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s use of acquired programming within its schedules is considerably less than many other public service media organisations of equivalent scale.  For example, the Swedish, Danish and Finnish public broadcasters feature international programming as more than 50% of their overall schedule.  It is a criteria that the BAI tracks within its assessment of performance every year.  On RT&Eacute; One, the number of hours of local content was 76%, a little over the target of 75%.  On RT&Eacute; 2 it was just under 40% which was also within the target range.  Acquired programming has an important role to play in all public service media schedules.  It brings high-quality content of all types from around the world at a very competitive price.  Integrating programming from other countries can add to the diversity of the schedule and enhance our perspective on the world.  For a smaller country like Ireland, acquired programmes can help balance the running costs of individual service and enhance complementarity and choice within the overall live viewing offerings in particular.<br\/><br\/>As the RT&Eacute; Player continues to evolve, we have been increasing the rights access to international programming and we have been increasing our video-on-demand access within all new negotiations, offering additional value and opportunity to view for our viewers, and this will continue as on-demand becomes ever more popular.  In this way, some of the best content created on an international basis is made available on a free-to-air basis, to Irish audiences.  However, it is indigenous Irish programming that ultimately is of most value in terms of helping to define the character and distinctiveness of national public service broadcasting, and it is the area in which we have ambitions to invest more in the years ahead.  As noted in the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's Mediatique report of 2017, the most recent comprehensive report on the overall national media market, expenditure on original Irish TV content is dominated by the public service broadcasters, led by RT&Eacute;.  Although some of the other commercial services such as Sky would have a larger overall spend on content offerings, only a very small percentage of this is on original Irish production.  Investing in Irish programming is also the way in which RT&Eacute; can most meaningfully contribute to the ambitions of the national audiovisual action plan and how it can help create real stimulus within the creative economy.<\/p><p>Ireland punches above its weight with regard to the talent that is available, internationally recognised independent production companies, BAFTA winning directors, and Academy Award winning animation.  Over the years, RT&Eacute; has been privileged to work with some of Ireland's finest actors, directors, writers, producers and independent companies.  In 2018, RT&Eacute; invested just over &euro;40 million in the independent sector, but that pales in comparison with what our spend once was.<\/p><p> Apart from the impact on RT&Eacute;, this sector has also been severely adversely affected by the moneys lost through Ireland's outdated and inefficient collection system.  Although RT&Eacute; remains the largest commissioner of indigenous Irish content, spend on this important element of national storytelling lags behind its potential.  The real cost is the lost opportunity.  The effects of this are threefold.  The creative economy is deprived of much-needed stimulus.  Public service broadcasters are a key investor in and showcase for independent production companies.  Many of most talented programme makers, screenwriters, actors and comedians leave for the UK, US and beyond.  It is a drain in talent that a small country like Ireland cannot afford.  Perhaps most importantly, Irish audiences lose out.  Indigenous programming and journalism suffer, repeats become a feature of schedules more than is desirable, and audiences switch off from national services in favour of international competitors, which means less engagement with national topics and national culture.  Ultimately, this encapsulates the nub of the current position and what is at risk.<\/p><p> The challenges being faced are a serious threat to the future of public service broadcasting at a time when public service media, with a publicly owned national service to reflect Ireland's voice and identity, have never been more important.  It has material consequences for the audiovisual, sports and cultural sectors of the country.  RT&Eacute; has a plan to address this, but unless there is commensurate policy and legislative action, then public service media will potentially be weakened irrevocably.  Less than two weeks ago, \"The Late Late Toy Show\" attracted a live audience of more than 1.3 million viewers, or 1.7 million in total when one adds worldwide streaming.  That show was about many things.  It was a big show with brave voices, electric performances and a lot of fun.  At its core were the stories and experiences of some remarkable Irish kids.  The nation listened and we witnessed a huge outpouring of support for this incredible showcase of talent, diversity and inspiration.  It showed yet again that coming together as a community is a big part of who we are.  That is something that we should all fight for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting us to participate in today's meeting.  I hope that today's exchange will be of benefit to the committee in its understanding of funding issues regarding public sector broadcasting.  I will make a brief public statement and then, following contributions from RT&Eacute;, Ms Triona Quill and I will be available to answer questions.<\/p> <p>  There have been significant changes in the broadcasting sector in the past decade.  These include the rise of digital advertising via search engines and social media, advances in content streaming services, and changes in the way people access audiovisual content.  While these changes have improved the accessibility and quality of content, recent developments such as disinformation highlight the importance of trusted and reliable sources of publicly available information.  Both public and private broadcasters have been impacted by these developments with the impact on advertising revenues.  Share of advertising spend in the digital sector has risen from 7% in 2007 to a current figure of 40% in an environment where it is estimated that Google and Facebook obtain 75% of all digital sector advertising spend.  Changing advertising trends arising both from the recession and from Brexit have resulted in a decline of approximately 35% in commercial revenues available to Irish broadcasters since 2009, with media convergence and the resultant shift to digital advertising impacting heavily upon broadcasting and print media in particular.<\/p> <p>  The decline in advertising revenue, coupled with challenges with the TV licensing collection model, such as the unacceptably high evasion rate, currently running at nearly 13%, the exclusion of 10% of households that do not have a TV and the relatively high collection costs of 7%, is having a critical impact on RT&Eacute;'s revenues and has resulted in a position where the financial sustainability of the organisation is now under immediate threat.<\/p> <p>  To address its current financial position, RT&Eacute; has put together a revised strategy to cover the next four years that will include a number of changes to its current portfolio.  These include cost reduction, further land and asset sales, increased public funding, future-proofing its offering and offering live experiences with ticketed events.  In recognition of the current financial situation at RT&Eacute;, the Minister requested that NewERA evaluate the revised RT&Eacute; strategy with a view to assessing RT&Eacute;'s feasibility.  In its report, NewERA agreed that the current financial situation at the broadcaster is unsustainable.  The Department is in ongoing contact with senior management in RT&Eacute; regarding its financial position and proposals for reform.  The detail of these matters is being considered by Department officials in conjunction with NewERA officials and colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Minister intends to bring forward a memo on the matter shortly.  That has been overtaken by events this morning, which I am happy to cover.<\/p> <p>  An additional &euro;10 million in public funding has been allocated to RT&Eacute; over the past two budgets.  This includes an additional &euro;8.6 million made available in budget 2019 through a combination of an increase in Exchequer funding for public service broadcasting, which replaced TG4's TV licence funding, and an increase in the amount paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for free TV licences.  This builds on the increase in funding for public service broadcasting in 2018, funded through a &euro;1.64 million increase in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's contribution for free TV licences.  TG4 was allocated an additional &euro;443,000 in Exchequer funding for 2019 in addition to the &euro;2 million in current and capital funding that it received in 2018, bringing the total increase since the start of the five-year review period to almost &euro;2.5 million.  TG4 was also allocated a once-off capital grant of &euro;985,000 in 2018 for its expenditure relating to Bliain na Gaeilge.<\/p> <p>  The increased contribution from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in both 2018 and 2019 also benefits An Post and the broadcasting fund.  The broadcasting fund is a fund administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, that includes the sound and vision scheme, which supports high-quality programming on Irish culture, heritage and experience, programmes to improve adult literacy, and archiving schemes.  It benefits the broadcasting sector as a whole, including independent production.<\/p> <p>  In its report published in November 2017, the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recommended that Revenue collect the TV licence and the replacement of the current TV licence with a broadcasting charge.  In response, the working group on the future funding of public service broadcasting was set up by a Government decision in July 2018 to examine options for the future funding of broadcasting.  The key recommendations of its report are that the TV licence be put out to public tender as soon as the enabling legislation, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, is enacted.  It will be necessary to offer a fixed term contract of five years to make it feasible for the successful tenderer to invest in the database and collection improvements.  Another recommendation is that at the end of the contract period, the licence fee should be replaced by a device-independent charge to support public service content on a sustainable basis.  It was felt by the group that due to a number of issues surrounding the implementation of a device-independent charge, including owner-occupier liability, how to charge commercial premises, perception issues around collecting with the local property tax, and how the charge would be collected from social and local authority housing, an interim measure was needed to address the issue immediately.  The Government has accepted the working group&rsquo;s recommendations and is bringing forward an amendment to the Broadcasting Act that will enable the collection of the TV licence to be put out to public tender.<\/p> <p>  On 18 July 2019, the Government approved the publication of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 and tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to appoint an agent through a public procurement competition for the collection of the TV licence fee.  The proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009 will allow for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to be part funded up to a maximum of 50% from TV licence receipts.  It is intended that any consequent reductions in broadcasting levy contributions would be applied across the board by the BAI so that all broadcasters would benefit in equal proportion from the measure.  It is proposed that doing this will provide scope to exempt smaller community radio stations from the broadcasting levy altogether.  The Bill allows for the Minister to decide what percentage of the levy to fund from TV licence receipts.  It will allow the BAI to accrue a level of working capital to meet its day-to-day expenses without the need to pursue a costly and burdensome borrowing facility and grant authority to the BAI to determine exemptions and deferrals to the levy depending on the qualifying income of individual broadcasters and the level of regulation they require.<\/p><p> It will give the BAI greater flexibility regarding which broadcasters are covered by the levy and to what extent.  This will create a legislative environment by which new broadcasters, including, for example, any that might wish to relocate to the State after Brexit, can be levied appropriately, thereby contributing to the cost of their regulation.  A number of broadcasters have relocated EU services to Ireland already in light of Brexit, the main ones being Sports Information Services, SIS, and SSBL which operates FreeSports.  The BAI has licensed four section 71 contracts in the past ten months.  The BAI remains in contact with a number of large UK-based broadcasters which are considering relocating to Ireland if a no-deal Brexit materialises.<\/p><p> The Bill also addresses a gap in the existing legislation whereby the holder of the section 70 contract is exempted from the requirement to apply for a licence for any additional services it chooses to offer.  It seeks to ensure that any new services could not operate on an unregulated basis and clarifies that they would require a section 71 licence.<\/p><p> In order to further support community and local radio, the Bill will allow for the creation of a new funding scheme that would permit the granting of bursaries to journalists in these stations, which are the starting point for many journalists&rsquo; careers.  It is intended that approximately &euro;500,000 would be made available by the BAI to support 20 annual bursaries of &euro;25,000 each.<\/p><p> The Bill repeals sections 103 and 251 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 as the public policy objectives for which they were introduced, mainly to support the roll-out of cable television services in Ireland, have been achieved.  In addition, television services are now available over a wider range of platforms, including satellite, which do not benefit from a similar exemption.  The proposed repeals have been agreed with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p> The Bill went through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 21 October and is expected to be brought to Committee Stage in the new year.<\/p><p> I hope that this has helped the committee in its consideration of these issues.  Along with my colleague, Ms Quill, I look forward to answering any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I have a question for RT&Eacute;.

While there was an iteration of a plan that was supposed to set RT&Eacute; back on to an even keel, we now have another plan.  Further land may be sold, the <i>RT&Eacute; Guide<\/i>may be sold and some art may also be sold.  We are somewhat sceptical about what we are hearing.  We had great belief in RT&Eacute; when, three and a half years ago, it set out in a very direct way its desire to put a plan in place.  What it has done to date has not worked.  I do not put all that on Ms Forbes's shoulders.  While this committee responded to her challenge, how the Government responded to that is another matter.  I am on record over the Government failures in that regard.

With a bit of thought, the Department could have put in place a burden-sharing between the landlord and tenant.  It does not take five years to work that out.  I suggest that the Department has deliberately chosen, perhaps because of the electoral cycle, not to accept what this committee recommended.  Instead, it has given itself a five to seven-year holiday from reality.  It has decided to ignore the obvious proposition, which I among others have spoken about at this committee and elsewhere.  There are simple collection mechanisms for every home, every hotel and business that uses communication, which the Revenue Commissioners could easily implement through local property tax, commercial rates or whatever.<\/p> <p>  Why has the Department said this is so complex that it needs several years to do it when it is just a case of the Department rolling up its sleeves?

People can watch RT&Eacute; content on those platforms, but they do not have to pay anything in return.  Approximately 80% of most advertising is gained by two companies - Google and Facebook.

According to a European Broadcasting Union assessment of the market that was conducted earlier this year, the value of digital advertising increased from approximately &euro;100 million in 2009 to almost &euro;600 million in 2018.  That money is going largely to two companies, namely, Facebook and Google, which are headquartered here.  These massive global players are resident here.  The audiovisual media services directive, which is due to be brought into Irish law by the end of next year, facilitates the possible introduction by Ireland or any member state of a system that would, in effect, place a levy on these entities.  Such a fund could be used to create an Irish content fund that would invest in Irish programming.  We would support such a measure because it would create a much-needed stimulus.  I think it should be a contestable fund for Irish programme makers and Irish broadcasters of all hues, rather than for RT&Eacute; alone.

All of the decisions we are taking now are, therefore, difficult in the sense that they affect the public and staff.  Nobody likes to go there but, unfortunately, that is where we are at.  In making all our choices, we rooted everything in two overarching principles.

They were the two big pillars that we considered and, within that, we had to make many choices and decisions.<\/p> <p>  On the rent and so on in Limerick, the rent for our current premises is higher at this point than the figure mentioned by the Senator.

If the station is moved out of Limerick those partnerships will be lost because people will be unable to travel to Dublin and Cork.

I know all of the Deputies and Senators from the region are very concerned about the situation and it would be a popular move to adjust it to whatever is possible to retain at least a majority of it in Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#K00500","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>As we mentioned, that announcement by the Taoiseach was made when we were in here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#K00700","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>We are not aware of the details behind it.

It has been a good project in the city.  When RT&Eacute; brought Lyric FM to Limerick, it was seen as the national broadcaster reaching out to the regions.  Now that RT&Eacute; is retreating from that, the opposite is going to be perceived.  It has not, as one can imagine, gone down well in the constituency.<\/p> <p>  I was really disappointed with Ms Forbes's answers to my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.  If RT&Eacute; has decided to move Lyric FM from Limerick, she must know how much savings it anticipates to make from that.  Ms Forbes said she cannot tell us what the savings will be, even though she said the figures are with the Department.  She would have understood that we were going to ask that question today, so it is perplexing to me as to why she cannot tell us that.  RT&Eacute; is moving Lyric FM from Limerick.  What I have been led to believe, and Ms Forbes cannot tell us the amount of savings, is that RT&Eacute; is going to split the station between Dublin and Cork.  The concern we have is that RT&Eacute; wants to get rid of Lyric FM by splitting it between two areas where it will not be as strong as it was in Limerick.  How can RT&Eacute; justify it being cheaper to run Lyric FM anywhere outside Limerick?  I would imagine that Limerick was the cheapest place to run it from.

Lyric is already served by three locations.  That happens right now.  While the majority comes out of Limerick, other programming comes out of Dublin and Cork.  As we said, these are difficult choices.  We have an awful lot less revenue than we had a number of years ago.  We are operating at deficits, which we have been asked to stop doing.  We cannot do everything, as we have done.  Hence, the most important thing in all of this was to make sure that we could maintain a service.  The proposal on the table right now is that that service can be maintained by splitting it between Dublin and Cork.  Since we have come in here, something has been said in the D&aacute;il so we have to review this in light of all that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the overall savings, I do not want to appear evasive but there are a number of factors at play that depend on the outcome of consultation with staff.  That is why I do not want to get into a specific number because that number is variable depending on what will happen.  I hope it is sufficient to say to Deputy Quinlivan that the saving would have to be significant for us to consider it.  The level of financial crisis we are in requires us to take a number of decisions that collectively will create a large number.  Sometimes that means taking lots of &euro;0.5 millions or &euro;400,000s from various places to come up with an overall number.  That is the place we are in.

If that were to happen, there would have to be a fundamental change in everything to do with RT&Eacute; in terms of the remit and particularly on whether or not the commerciality of it is viable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Ms Forbes might address the point around salaries<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#M01000","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I would not, at this point, agree with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#M01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I do not think it is for legislation to make a recommendation on salaries.

I want to bring the debate back to Lyric FM, because like so many others who have spoken, I am completely perplexed.  The staff in Lyric FM in Limerick are completely perplexed as to how much savings can be made, and the fact that to date - despite several people asking - we have received no answer in relation to the possible cost savings, which only adds to our frustration.  I want to ask Ms Forbes, in particular, about this because the staff have been extremely frustrated about the lack of information and communication from RT&Eacute; over the last couple of months.  On Friday when Ms Forbes meets with them, will she share the financial data they have been looking for in relation to the supposed cost savings of closing Lyric FM in Limerick?<\/p> <p>  I want to make another point.  Ms Forbes mentioned the three areas, namely, Limerick, Dublin, and Cork.  My understanding is that 80% of the programming of Lyric FM is either delivered or produced in Limerick, and as the union representative said at the Oireachtas briefing a couple of weeks ago, Lyric is Limerick.  This is not something that is shared between the three in an even fashion.  It is largely Limerick.  It is completely unacceptable, and I am really hoping that given today's announcement, RT&Eacute; will reverse this decision.

There was an announcement this afternoon about a new commission on public service broadcasting, which is to be initiated.  I am not sure if the officials here can talk to that in any detail.  I understand they may have been caught short on it themselves in terms of the timing of the announcement.  The Chair, myself, as Vice Chair, and the other members of the committee put quite a lot of work into a public service broadcasting review and report.  We had quite a large-scale event in Dublin Castle and we produced a report.  I hope we are not reinventing the wheel with this, so perhaps the Department officials would take that back to the Minister.  We have heard a lot a talk about Private Members' Bills in the House, but I hope the work of the committee and the cross-party group and the really strong policy initiative from the committee will be taken on board and that we do not have to start from scratch.  There is a lot of good work already done on that.<\/p><p>I have a couple of questions for Ms Forbes, and I thank RT&Eacute; for coming in today.  The first question is quite fundamental.  It comes up a lot in debate and sometimes it is described as nit-picking.  I refer to the model that RT&Eacute; is talking about moving towards.  I heard Ms Forbes in many interviews around the time of the recent RT&Eacute; announcements.  In one way, they showed RT&Eacute; at its best in terms of public service broadcasting, challenging debate, internal debate and not being afraid in regard to the subject matter.  Ms Forbes mentioned in many of the conversations, the new vision, the RT&Eacute; Player, online and moving to that space.  I suppose I am not seeing that backed up by action and reality.  Is there enough funding, for example, for digital channels, digital content production and digital delivery?  I refer in particular to the RT&Eacute; Player.  We have all had experience of the RT&Eacute; Player and this issue comes up again and again, but it comes up because it is real.  I have had experiences with iPads and other devices of trying to use the RT&Eacute; Player and eventually just having to fold the towel and walk away in disgust because it does not work.  It seems to get stuck on ads <i>ad infinitum<\/i>in a loop.  Is there anything at play in terms of that?  This is sometimes seen as nit-picking, but it is fundamental to the change Ms Forbes described and RT&Eacute; being serious about becoming an online portal and an on-demand portal.  That makes a lot of sense, but RT&Eacute; is really far away from that.  Where is RT&Eacute; on that digital delivery and what measures does it have to improve that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#N00600","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>On the broader point on digital <i>per se<\/i>, one of the key factors the last number of years has been our transition to become a digital-first organisation.  Deputy Dooley mentioned earlier what we had done over the last number of years, and I think news has been at the forefront of that in terms of becoming a digital-first organisation, whether it is through RT&Eacute; News Now or <i>rte.ie<\/i>, and that whole approach to servicing the public digitally first.  Ten years ago, one would have held back the story until the &quot;RT&Eacute; News: Six One&quot; but now it goes out as it happens.  There has been a huge investment in news and around our capability in that area.  That is already showing pretty good dividends.  RT&Eacute; News Now has been averaging about 100 million page views, for example, so we have seen a huge trajectory growth.<br\/><br\/>We have had some issues with the RT&Eacute; Player.  The issues have been twofold.  The technology is moving at an incredible pace in terms of development.  We have to invest more in the technology and we have committed to doing that.  That is the first thing.  The second thing is that the complexity of what the RT&Eacute; Player offers versus let us say Netflix is very different, because we are offering both on-demand content, so one can watch a box set, but we are also live-streaming, so one can watch a match, &quot;Fair City&quot; or whatever live.  That has been the huge growth area for us in the last year.  Again, that requires better infrastructure.  It also requires us to think differently internally.  It has been a huge learning curve, and I am disappointed that the RT&Eacute; Player has had issues, but we are in a technological place that is advancing at a huge pace, and we have committed to develop and to spend more money on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>RT&Eacute; has been delivering linear services on television for 50-odd years.

On the shift we have announced in the strategy, in one sense there is a lot of focus on the cost-cutting elements, and that it has been the case here.  The shift to on-demand is the big challenge that RT&Eacute; has to wrestle with.  As Ms Forbes mentioned, the shift is technically very difficult, and it is costly in terms of the investment made.  Disney, one the most well-resourced media companies in the world, just launched Disney+ a couple of weeks ago with great difficulties in streaming in the first couple of weeks at the types of scale we are used to.

In the debate that took place in the D&aacute;il Chamber a few weeks ago and on many other occasions, I have expressed a view - I think Deputy Dooley and other members of the committee share it - that in terms of public service broadcasting there is a general consensus that it is a public good.  Public service broadcasting should be protected and should be funded.  I think where the divergence comes is that it does not have to be RT&Eacute; that delivers it.  There is no reason we could not commission a model - perhaps this commission will end up with that finding - where a charge is collected, put into a pot, and indigenous content producers draw down from it.  RT&Eacute; has had the lion's share, has had the head-start, for the last 80 years or whatever number of years.  It really has to get up to the mark now in terms of staying there.

A series of reviews has been done on it.  Where one just breaks up the money and a grant-giver just allocates it to individual programme makers, one loses all sorts of benefits in culture and in an integrated newsroom that delivers news reporting across multiple channels.

A report done by An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga said that RT&Eacute; was not fulfilling its statutory obligation in relation to Irish language broadcasting on television.  Is it intended by the Department to strengthen the legislative provisions in relation to what is public service broadcasting, that is, what are we paying RT&Eacute; for?  Has the Department commissioned any reports or studies on the comparative costs of, for example, an hour of TG4 producing iSport versus RT&Eacute;, an hour on TG4 of documentaries versus RT&Eacute; and an hour of light entertainment on TG4 compared to RT&Eacute;, to see how RT&Eacute; compares per hour in terms of output, allowing the TG4 to have higher costs because it is doing it in a minority language?<\/p> <p>  The next question for the Department is as follows.  RT&Eacute; was given &euro;10 million today but were the needs of TG4 taken into account in deciding whether there be a fund for TG4?  Is it a case of the crying baby getting the bottle?  I think many of us might believe that that was the case.  The Department is reviewing public service broadcasting.  For many people in rural Ireland, public service broadcasting in terms of news, sport, etc., is complemented hugely by local radio.

I welcome the fact that RT&Eacute; is going to have detailed discussions with the staff on Friday.  I also welcome Ms Forbes's indication that she would consider the request of the Minister to defer the decision on the transfer of Lyric.  Could she confirm that, although I know she has not had a chance to look at it yet?<\/p> <p>  In listening to the responses, she referred to part of the reason for moving Lyric being excess capacity in Dublin and Cork.  Would it not be better to deal with the excess capacity in Dublin and Cork rather than transfer Lyric from Limerick?  I wish to reiterate the points around regional balance, and the hugely important cultural role that Lyric FM plays in the Limerick area and in the mid-west in general.<\/p> <p>  I know the witnesses were not able to specify the exact savings but there was certainly an implication - it might have been on a radio interview rather than here today - that part of that might be redundancies.  For people who cannot afford to move their families to more expensive accommodation, not to mention all the other elements of moving a family from Limerick, I would not describe this as voluntary redundancy but as forced redundancy.  I ask that RT&Eacute; do take that into consideration because there are many people who are working in Lyric in Limerick who are living in Limerick, have children going to school there and so on.<\/p><p> Finally, I wish to ask RT&Eacute; about the offer from University of Limerick.  Ms Forbes mentioned using facilities with higher educational institutions in other parts of the country.  I know there was a response to the effect that this was not suitable but I ask RT&Eacute; to look at it again as a possibility.  The institutions might be able to reach some kind of compromise with RT&Eacute; to facilitate its needs in Limerick.  The witnesses have heard today that across the parties, we feel very strongly that Lyric FM is really important to Limerick.

I, too, lend my support for the retention of Lyric FM in Limerick.  I hope the decision will be taken on sound grounds rather than on a request from the Taoiseach.  It would not be appropriate for RT&Eacute; to make a decision based on a request from the Taoiseach just because he is ponying up &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money.  The business case stands up and I certainly would not want to think there is political interference here or that this will play into some kind of grandstanding by the Government in that regard.  It makes absolute sense and is appropriate that Lyric FM be retained in Limerick.  Ms Forbes has been strong in the past on support for the regions and has identified again today the importance of that.  It works well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up on what my colleague, Senator Leyden, said.  There is a very strong level of engagement in the regions.  This is just my observation but I think RT&Eacute; has upped its game.  Perhaps this has just happened because there have been more stories; perhaps it is strategic, which would be great.  Even on weekends, I see RT&Eacute; doing a lot more regional stuff.  That is what we want to see.  As the removal of Lyric FM from Limerick would undermine what has been developing and working really well, I hope RT&Eacute; can find a way not to do that.  Lyric FM is a signal, a presence, in Limerick.  I know it has studios in other regional technical colleges, RTCs, and that may be fine where it did not have a presence previously, but the removal of Lyric FM would be seen as a reduction.  I will not speak for the people in Lyric FM - they will be more than able to represent themselves - but I will speak for the people I represent, who see the RT&Eacute; brand within the city of Limerick as speaking to the entire mid-west.  It is important that it be maintained.<\/p> <p>  I think it was in the Committee of Public Accounts that Ms Forbes previously talked about changing RT&Eacute;'s policies on the engagement of freelance contractors.  Where has RT&Eacute; got on that, and what are the cost implications?  Will RT&Eacute; save money or will it cost it more money to do that?  Ms Forbes also indicated the cutting of content in RT&Eacute;'s cost savings and the reduction of numbers.  We all know people who work here, in RT&Eacute; and around Leinster House.  People say to me there is very significant pressure in some areas within Ms Forbes's organisation - perhaps Ms Cusack will know more than anyone about this - in that there is not enough staff at certain times to deal with sick leave, maternity leave and so on.  It seems to me that reducing numbers could put very significant pressures on RT&Eacute;'s capacity to continue its current output.  There is that issue, what happened in Limerick and the way in which everything was leaked.  How does Ms Forbes view morale within the organisation at present?

I perceive Lyric FM and RT&Eacute; news broadcasting to be twin pillars in Limerick city.  They are in the heart of the city and are hugely important to us.  Apart from the staff and what they bring, having a national broadcaster like Lyric FM based in Limerick city, which is a cultural city, is hugely important.  I have been in and have broadcast from the state-of-the-art studio many times.  It is probably the next best technical studio outside of headquarters in Donnybrook.  RT&Eacute; broadcasts regionally in one section of the building and Lyric FM in the other.  Lyric FM itself does not require that level of space in the building at the moment and there are also archives stored there that are not required.  I made contact with the owner of the building and I asked the direct question as to whether RT&Eacute; had engaged in discussion with him about downsizing that particular floor, because it would cost a huge amount to dismantle.  He stated it was not discussed.  As he extended the lease to December 2020, I ask that RT&Eacute; now engage with the owner of the building to look at the floor area, to retain the RT&Eacute; regional broadcasting studios as they are and to downsize the floor area for Lyric.<\/p><p> Ms Forbes is probably very familiar with the studio, which is in the heart of Limerick city and what it brings to the city for the people of Limerick is enormous.  I could go on about the costs, the budget there is relatively low, but I would like Ms Forbes to give an assurance that she will explore the opportunities with the owner of the building to ascertain what lease possibilities are available.  I ask Ms Forbes to do that unconditionally.  I passionately believe in what RT&Eacute; does.  It is hugely important in terms of the quality of programming across the spectrum, including with TG4 and every area. Equally, Limerick has a twin aspect in that there is a regional broadcaster and Lyric FM in the same building.  It was a model of decentralisation at the time, signed off by President Michael D. Higgins in his capacity as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Will Ms Forbes give that commitment now to explore with the owner of the building what lease possibilities are available?  It is acknowledged that the organisation probably does not need the floor area that is there at the moment.  There are opportunities and would it not be fantastic, were Ms Forbes to find savings to retain the twin studios of the regional broadcaster and Lyric FM in the heart of Limerick city?  I wrote to Ms Forbes on 15 November.  I followed that up with an email but this is a specific request.  I have made the inquiry, and the owner tells me that discussions on downsizing did not take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#P02900","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>In relation to Lyric FM, as the Senator has mentioned, the Taoiseach has said something in the D&aacute;il Chamber.

It is unthinkable that the public service broadcaster would not continue to exist and flourish because it always has played and always should play an absolutely key role in Irish society and cultural life and in its role in journalism.  As I do not know how many of these questions Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has put to the witnesses, I apologise if I am repeating anything she said.  Ms Forbes does not help her cause if she defends things that are indefensible in the minds of many people who might otherwise support her.  Ms Forbes does not help her cause if she sees the solution to the financial crisis of RT&Eacute; as being essentially to dip into the pockets of ordinary people or saving RT&Eacute; at the expense of its employees and the quality and extent of its services.  Ms Forbes will actually damage her own cause in trying to defend RT&Eacute; and the public service broadcasting.<\/p> <p>The point has been well made but I just want to emphasise the cultural importance of Lyric FM.  It is a unique guardian of music culture, including original music, new music, classical music and international music.  It brings music that is not heard by a mass audience to a mass audience, that is, music that might not otherwise be heard by a mass audience.  It would be incredibly retrograde to even consider winding it down, reducing it or getting rid of it altogether, not to mention the human cost for people who relocated to Limerick and so on.<\/p> <p>Ms Forbes knows the things that are unpopular with people.  This is not in any way to get at individuals but whatever justification there might have been for people getting paid hundreds of thousands of euro, when there was a genuine possibility some of them might go to England or somewhere else, is gone now.  As that is not going to happen in the age of Google, Amazon and Netflix, it would help Ms Forbes's cause with the public if she talked about a cap on salaries.  It is just not conscionable that people would be paid salaries higher than the Taoiseach for broadcasting.  It is just not defensible.  People went to jail over the licence fee because they could not afford to pay it.  In the case of a lot of people who do not pay, it is because they cannot pay.  Ms Forbes would be better off focusing on how there was a cut in the amount RT&Eacute; got from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which was capped and on getting that money back, as well as on measures like retransmission fees, digital taxes and so on.<\/p> <p>The last point I want to make is that the biggest card RT&Eacute; should play is in the area of original, culturally important output.  Arts and culture in this country are massively underfunded. It is 0.1% of GDP, as against an average of 0.6% in Europe, and we should point to that.  We should address the salaries and bring them down.  We should of course be efficient but in fact, we should be expanding original, dramatic output and stuff that is relevant to the culture.  We should be making the argument for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#Q01100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":552,"content":"<p>There is one minute left to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019121000002#Q01200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.

It is one of the areas where our output has actually increased because of the way we restructured ourselves as an organisation.<\/p><p>Now, there is a thread of arts and cultural output going through all areas of RT&Eacute;, from radio to TV to digital on a regular basis.  I hope that there will be some element in the commission that was announced this morning, for example, on the future of public service broadcasting, to address Irish content for Irish audiences but also the importance of that and the Irish voice.

There is a number of examples of that in Germany, France and across the Union, but a mechanism has not been devised here yet.  It is available to the Oireachtas to come up with a proposal.  We are talking about companies that generate enormous sums of money in this market and that invest very little, if any, in the original programming.  Retransmission fees are one part of it, but the AVMS directive allows for a levy to be created, which could be transformative for key genres like TV drama, which is going through an explosion globally in terms of the demand for it.

I thank the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p> <p>  As Members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and provides solicitor services within the Office of the Attorney General and to Departments and offices.  While the Taoiseach has certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the office operates independently of the Department. <\/p> <p>  The office has a wide remit, including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including attending at the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law, commercial contract and other solicitor services for the line Departments and other Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity, and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;5 million is sought to cover extra expenditure on fees to counsel in 2019.  The management of expenditure on counsels' fees is a key activity for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals, and the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable for the provision of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Office of the Attorney General or for Departments and Offices. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time, and so is always difficult for the office to forecast.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation and transactional work, procurement work, and advisory and litigation work resulting from our membership of the European Union, and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment law and social welfare law. <\/p> <p>  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex, which leads to greater use of counsel.  An allocation of &euro;13.5m was made in terms of expenditure on fees for counsel in 2019, which was the same as 2018.  However, due to a carryover of &euro;3.31 million in fees from 2018 and anticipated additional expenditure of &euro;2.29 million in 2019 a shortfall of &euro;5.6 million will arise.  The office will make use of savings of &euro;600,000 in other areas of the Vote to assist with this shortfall but a supplementary of &euro;5 million is required.<\/p><p>I should also point out the allocation for fees to counsel in 2020 has been increased by &euro;1.5 million, giving a total allocation of &euro;15 million.  The office together, with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its main client Departments in an effort to remain within budget in 2020.  I am pleased to recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#C00900","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Having considered the Supplementary Estimate and the Minister of State's remarks, the committee accepts the supplementary evidence.

I am here to present a proposal for four Supplementary Estimates, two of which come under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote group and two of which come under the Department of Finance Vote group.<\/p> <p>  On the public expenditure and reform Vote group, there is a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000, resulting in a gross Estimate of &euro;5 million, in respect of Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances.  There is a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;470,000 in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service.<\/p> <p>  On the finance Vote group, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;21.2 million is required in respect of Vote 7 - the Department of Finance, and a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4.104 million is required in respect of Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  With respect to Vote 12, pensions and lump sums paid under the pensions scheme for established civil servants make up just under 90% of gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  The main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire during the year.  There are a number of different reasons it can be difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next but the 2019 gross estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;609.9 million euro, which was based on a forecast of 1,700 retirements.  As a general rule, the once-off lump sum paid to each person who retires is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A.4, which is the main driver of expenditure variance on the Vote in any given year.  At the end of October, &euro;90.4 million had been expended from section A.4, compared with the original 2019 full-year Estimate of &euro;101.6 million.  Further expenditure of up to &euro;25.3 million is estimated by the end of the year, resulting in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;14.1 million on the subhead.   It is now estimated that total gross expenditure on the Vote may be in the region of &euro;614.9 million, which is &euro;5 million ahead of the gross Estimate as voted previously by the Oireachtas. <\/p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated somewhat by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  In 2019, these were estimated at &euro;238.6 million, which was ahead of profile.  Total appropriations are now projected to be &euro;243.6 million, which is &euro;5 million more than expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the total gross Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the Supplementary Estimate in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, the Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Vote will bring the total 2019 Estimate for that Vote to &euro;15.503 million, which is a 3.1% increase on the total allocation of &euro;15.033 million.   <\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 7 is to meet the cost of legal settlements entered into by the State following advice from senior counsel.  The settlements are in respect of protracted legal proceedings arising from the air travel tax introduced in budget 2009 and agreements which were entered into following mediation with Mr. Justice Paul Gilligan.<\/p><p>The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 9 is to meet the 2019 costs associated with developing the Brexit infrastructure required as part of our no-deal preparations.  The total cost to be met is &euro;4.104 million.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied that approval of the supplementary estimate of &euro;1,000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants expected to retire up to the end of 2019.  I am satisfied that approval of the supplementary estimate of &euro;470,000 will enable the wider public service to prepare for future challenges through the Public Appointments Service.  I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimates for the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Finance will allow us to deal with the requirements outlined in my address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#D01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Will the Minister give us some more information on the &euro;20 million for Vote 7?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121000002#E00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the obligations entered into by the Department in the context of settlement agreements with two airlines - Aer Lingus and Ryanair.

The purpose of today's meetings is to start our deliberations on the topic of employment.  This is our first hearing of four examining the disproportionate levels of unemployment among Travellers.  By listening to presenters from the Traveller community and others, we hope to get a sense of the scale of the problems facing Travellers in accessing jobs and how to remove those barriers to employment.  Since we started our public work in September, this joint committee has become aware of the key issues affecting and bearing down on Travellers.  These issues do not stand alone; they are very much connected.  Members of the committee will know that Travellers are seven times more likely to take their own lives.  According to the Irish Traveller Movement, an estimated 30 people, including children, died by suicide up to the end of August this year.  A trend in that regard is also emerging among young mothers.  The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health admitted that there is a crisis in mental healthcare among Travellers.  Members of this committee will also know that there are gross disparities in the general health of Travellers and that of the general population.  The mortality rate of babies born to Traveller families is almost four times that of the general population.  A Traveller baby is therefore four times more likely to die than a non-Traveller baby in the cot next to him or her in the hospital.  Travellers die young.  Some 70% of Travellers fail to reach their 60th birthday.<\/p><p>The committee is aware that Travellers are 50 times more likely to leave school without a leaving certificate.  Travellers are disproportionately affected by the practice of reduced hours timetables in a curriculum where their culture and history are neither taught, understood, nor respected and where children and young people not so much, acknowledged the issues and indicated they are willing to consider the committee's recommendations.<br\/><br\/>Poor educational attainment among Travellers has knock-on effects for employment, which is our topic for examination today.  The statistics in this regard are stark.  On foot of the census carried out by the CSO in 2016, we are aware that 80% of Travellers within the potential workforce are unemployed in comparison with 13% of the general population.  Some 1.1% of Travellers are self-employed, compared with 16.6% of the wider community.  Self-employment was such a big source of employment for Travellers in the past.  According to the ESRI's A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, the employment rate of non-Travellers is six times higher than that of Travellers.  Whatever way we slice and dice the statistics, the disparities are vast.  Comparatively speaking, the Traveller employment rate national is just 9% among those with a primary level education, 15% among those with lower second level education, which is the junior certificate, 27% among those with a leaving certificate and 57% among the very small number of people with a further or higher education.  This compares with a figure of 85% among members of the wider community.  In the national Traveller survey, of the 60% of Travellers who participated in a trainee scheme, only three in ten went on to get jobs.  A total of 43% of Travellers have stated that they experience discrimination in accessing employment and only one in ten of non-Traveller employers said they would employ a Traveller.  This is prejudice and discrimination on a pretty grand scale.  The topic is very important, and there are huge tracks back to education, health and mental health.  The off-the-scale rate of unemployment is a waste of people's potential and it affects people's mental health and life chances.  Such disparities at a time of full employment and skills shortages merit a major investigation.  We hope to make that start today.<br\/><br\/>I welcome Mr. Patrick Reilly from Pavee Point.  He is back before the committee to tell his story and he is very welcome.  We hope the story will lead to action.  I am conscious of the effort and energy put in by so many people like Mr. Reilly. <b><\/b>Ms Kathleen Sherlock and Mr. T.J.

The committee members have received a copy of our detailed submission.<\/p><p>I do not intend to cover the full submission in my opening statement.  I will instead give a brief overview.<\/p><p> In November, the committee heard testimony from Traveller and Roma representatives about the experience of our communities in accessing, participating in and delivering good outcomes from education.  Today's discussion is focused on employment, but educational disadvantage and poor levels of educational attainment are key factors in the significant employment gap between Travellers and Roma and the majority population.  Therefore, dealing with unemployment in our communities must occur in parallel with targeted and mainstream measures to address educational inequalities.<\/p><p> Data from the 2016 census show an unemployment rate among Travellers of 80% compared with 13% among the majority.  Data from the national Roma needs assessment indicated that approximately 17% of Roma respondents were in employment.  Traveller and Roma participation in employment is hampered by a range of barriers.  The key barriers are: low levels of educational attainment at all levels compared with the majority population; high levels of reported discrimination in accessing education, employment and key supports and services; failure by statutory stakeholders to accommodate cultural differences; and high levels of social exclusion and socioeconomic disadvantage, which hinder access to education, training and employment networks and opportunities.  There are additional barriers for the Roma community: lack of access to State supports and benefits, where Roma find it difficult to meet the habitual residence condition or where they cannot provide proof of residence; and low levels of proficiency in the English language and, for some, low levels of literacy and numeracy in their language of origin.<\/p><p> The barriers facing Travellers and Roma in accessing and participating in employment suggest the need for sustained and targeted measures involving action from a number of stakeholders across the statutory, NGO and private sectors.  The stakeholders involved in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy have a key role to play in supporting any such initiative.<\/p><p> We would like to bring the committee's attention to a number of areas and forthcoming opportunities that hold the potential to improve Traveller and Roma participation in employment and further education and training.  However, this will require commitment on the part of the State to increase its ambition to secure good outcomes for our communities in the area of employment.<\/p><p> The forthcoming Pathways to Work - the new job strategy - is being prepared by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Since there is almost full employment in the State, there is an opportunity to focus the new jobs strategy towards a stated principle of active inclusion.  Pavee Point has made a number of recommendations to the Department in respect of the strategy.  These are set out in our submission and include the following: the strategy should set out a number of targeted actions and mainstream approaches aimed at increasing the quality of Traveller and Roma engagement with and outcomes from the public employment service delivered through Intreo centres; targeted initiatives could be developed to support Traveller and Roma enterprise in conjunction with local enterprise offices, LEOs; an increase in Traveller and Roma participation in apprenticeships in conjunction with employers, SOLAS and education and training boards, ETBs; and the development of targeted training and employment pathways through the social inclusion and community activation programme, local employment services and mainstream employment services.<\/p><p> SOLAS is preparing a new national further education and training strategy.  SOLAS funds the 16 ETBs around the country.  These are key providers of training and further education to early school leavers and marginalised communities, including members of the Traveller community.  Pavee Point has made a number of recommendations to SOLAS regarding this strategy.  Specific targeted measures by providers are required to address the diversity of needs within the Traveller and Roma community.  For example, apprenticeships and training should be tailored to respond to and take advantage of the potential in the cultural practices and economic nature evident in the Traveller community, such as apprenticeships and training in the equine industry, tinsmithing and recycling.  Career guidance models that are culturally sensitive, with access to specific learning pathways that include positive action measures to address the needs of Travellers and achieve an acceleration of their learning pathways, should be developed.<\/p><p>SOLAS could usefully develop and pilot a pair model of further education training and support based on the successful Traveller primary healthcare project developed by Pavee Point.<\/p><p> The public sector equality and human rights duty is an important part of equality and human rights legislation.  The duty requires public bodies, including Departments, to take proactive steps to promote equality and human rights and prevent discrimination.  This duty could be an important means of driving greater equality in how our public services are designed and delivered.  Key public services providers in the areas of employment, education and training, accommodation and health have enormous potential to reduce inequalities in society.  There is an onus on such public sector bodies to therefore discharge on their obligations under their public sector duty.<\/p><p> There are three areas where positive outcomes for Travellers and Roma could be driven.  Our submission contains more detail than I can cover in my opening statement.  I thank the committee for its attention and I am happy to answer any questions that I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Mr. Reilly will be pleased to know that we have invited the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, before the committee and she may be able to give an update on Pathways to Work when she appears before us.

It can create no other outcomes for the community involved aside from poverty and deprivation for those who must deal with it.  To understand how this is possible and how any community could be left in this position, particularly in a prosperous country like Ireland, we must look at the underlying causes, including anti-Traveller bias and racism that has been allowed to go unchecked in this country for generations.  The country has been discriminating, isolating and excluding the only indigenous ethnic minority community.<\/p> <p>  The negative impact of the mistreatment of Traveller communities is all too evident.  As a community, we are dealing with multiple crises.  For example, there is short life expectancy, much of which is due to poverty-related illnesses, and chronic ill-health is due to having to live in substandard and hazardous conditions.  A decades-old crisis in Traveller accommodation has led to escalating levels of homelessness in our community and more recently we have seen a frightening rise in the numbers of Travellers with depression and addiction and who commit suicide.  Each death leaves a painful legacy of suffering, altering forever the lives of the families left behind, including bereaved spouses and, very often, young and orphaned children.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Traveller population currently comprises fewer than 40,000 people.  Bright and talented Traveller children leave school with little or no education, some barely literate, and this limits their ability to access employment.  Even the few who are able to navigate the educational system and achieve educational qualifications struggle to find employment.  All over the world, people see employment and education leading to better employment as routes to break free from poverty in an honest and dignified way but for the majority of the Traveller community, this opportunity does not exist.  Doors to employment are closed to them because of their Traveller identity and many members of the community feel they have no other choice but to hide their identity in order to get a job or out of fear of losing a job or being subject to anti-Traveller racism in the workplace.<\/p> <p>  Anti-Traveller racism continues unchecked in workplaces.  It also continues to go unchecked in the education system and in society as a whole.  The result is a community in crisis due to poverty and want.  A proud and once self-sufficient people are now overly dependent on the State while their skills and talents go unused and wasted.  Our community is corralled in dead ends because of discrimination, low educational attainment and a lack of work opportunities.  We are stuck in poverty and this leads to depression and addiction.<\/p><p>In some cases, people demonstrate antisocial behaviour and criminality because they see no other way out.  The negative impact of this is not just on the Traveller community but on society as a whole.  For decades, the elders in our community have highlighted the need for work and jobs for Travellers because they could see far off the negative impacts of not having anything to do was having, and would have, on our people with no opportunity for work or jobs.  To highlight this, I will read some lyrics from a song called &quot;Campfire in the Dark&quot;, which was written in the 1980s by Paddy Houlihan during his time in Ennis:<\/p><blockquote>\tMy father rises early and he makes a sup of tea<br \/><br \/>He lights the kitchen fire and then he calls me<br \/><br \/>His days are often empty, he's nothing much to do<br \/><br \/>So he sits and tells me of the travelling life he knew. <\/blockquote><p>The song was made famous by the Fureys.  The situation is far worse now for Travellers than it was at that time.  Back then, Traveller men could still gather scrap and get some casual work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Minc&eacute;irs Whiden believes that Traveller employment should be addressed in a meaningful way.  In order to turn matters around, the Government must acknowledge and address the anti-Traveller voices and racism that are causing deprivation among the Traveller community in terms of accessing meaningful employment.  It can do so by means of education, training and legislation.  The Government must also work with employers in the public and private sectors to open doors for real employment opportunities for the Traveller community that will lead to better outcomes.<\/p> <p>  The Traveller community is diverse and is filled with talents and capabilities.  Our people just need an opportunity.  Many of our people have tried very hard to access employment but have had no success.  That is not because of a lack of willingness or ability but because of anti-Traveller bias.<\/p> <p>  We must take on board the view of both the skills and abilities that exist within the Traveller community.  One fit does not suit all.  There are many of us who are ready and willing to take up suitable employment immediately but others need supports in order to bridge the gap and obtain recognised qualifications relating to their natural talents.  Among the members of the Traveller community, there are many talents.  Our community of Traveller men and women are gifted with their hands.  As a result, they are natural craftspeople.  Many of them are artists, seamstresses, beauticians, hairdressers, carpenters, builders and mechanics, even though they have no formal qualifications.  There are Traveller men who know everything about horses.  A growing number of academics have come through the third level schools and institutes but they cannot access meaningful employment.<\/p> <p>  Our people are natural leaders, learners and teachers.  To date, the educational result of our community does not reflect this.  The Traveller community just wants what everyone else wants.  We want a fair, equal and just society, and an ability to contribute, live with dignity and provide for ourselves and our families.  If the members have any questions, we will be glad to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

I have been employed as the Traveller enterprise and employment policy officer.  To enhance the work that I do, my position is seconded to the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  I am joined this morning by a trustee of the board, Dr. Mary Murphy, who is a senior lecturer in the Department of Sociology of Maynooth University.<\/p> <p>  St. Stephen's Green Trust is not a Traveller organisation but it works in solidarity to contribute to improving the situation for Travellers.  My role is around contributing to the increased participation of Travellers in employment and enterprise.  Another programme of St. Stephen's Green Trust, the Travellers in prison initiative, has previously made a submission to this committee as part of the mental health module.<\/p><p>Information on the other work of the trust and the source of its funds is available in our annual report.  In May 2019, St. Stephen's Green Trust published a short report entitled, Minc&eacute;ir Gruber Malaid Streed: What Next for Traveller Employment?  This report has been included as part of our submission.  Its objective was to contribute to knowledge on how and why high numbers of Travellers are unemployed, to reflect the policy context and to make some recommendations.  As members will no doubt be aware, more than 80% of Travellers are unemployed.  In the 2016 census, this equated to 8,541 individuals although many more will be affected.  The 2016 census also found that one in eight Travellers was unable to work due to a disability.  That is almost three times the rate among the general population.  <\/p><p> A major issue with finding solutions to the low level of Traveller participation in the labour market is the invisibility of Travellers in policy and practice.  There are no targets for Travellers in the public employment services.  None of the agents of the State counts whether it engages Travellers or whether it is successful in moving Travellers into employment.  Our report cites examples of Travellers having to hide their identities in employment to avoid racism and discrimination.  A 2017 Behaviour and Attitudes survey found that only 17% of the general public said they would employ a Traveller.  This can be contrasted with a 2019 SOLAS survey in which more than 60% of employers said that they would employ an ex-prisoner.  A 2017 Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report on workplace discrimination found that the number of Travellers among survey respondents was too low to examine workplace discrimination.  The 2018 SOLAS review of pathways to apprenticeships acknowledges the proven links between ethnic and socioeconomic status and access to, and progression in, education.  It references Travellers and commits to taking additional practical steps to improve Traveller participation but it does not specify what these steps should be.  We are not aware of any progress in this regard.  <\/p><p> Other reports reviewed in our research do not mention Travellers or specify targets for service providers.  The main Government strategy encouraging access to employment, Pathways to Work 2016-2020, does not mention Travellers, nor does the 2017 action plan for jobless households, the 2018 Action Plan for Jobs, or the 2019 Future Jobs Ireland report.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, names Travellers as a target group but does not include targets.  Travellers' access to, retention in and progression through SICAP is very low, accounting for just 2% of the total programme caseload for the period from 2015 to 2017.  <\/p><p> Barriers to Travellers' access and progress include inadequate public services and discrimination.  In some cases, Travellers do not view education as the best route to income generation.  Programmes are not designed to take Traveller-specific culture into account.  Enablers of the successful design and delivery of programmes for Travellers include leadership and accountability, effective administrative structures, a person-centred approach, and creative and flexible progression measures.  Our recommendations with regard to participation include more intentional action by the public employment services and the inclusion of Travellers in the design of solutions.  The local employment service, LES, guidance and counselling model, which is grounded in a person-centred approach, is considered to be more appropriate than the current transactional approach in the public employment services, which emphasises deficits in education and skills.  A national action plan to mainstream Traveller employment across all facets of the public service should be established with targets set for all relevant agencies.  There should be more ambitious targets for Traveller participation and outcomes from supports under SICAP.  Cognisance of the particular needs of Travellers should be included in all employment policy, including Future Jobs Ireland, Pathways to Work and implementation of the public sector duty.  There is also a need to gender-proof policy in respect of Traveller women.  More detail on the rationale for these recommendations is included in our research report.

Involve provides youth work services to young Travellers and publishes the <i>Travellers' Voice <\/i>magazine under the management of Mr. Michael Power.  We sit on the Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy group, which is known as NTRIS.  I had the privilege of chairing the employment subgroup of NTRIS.  I have spent my entire professional career working with the Traveller community.  My background is in this line of work.  As a professional, I suggest that the issue of Traveller unemployment can be addressed and resolved with the right strategic approach.  My professional belief is that if we address the question of employment, other challenging issues, including education, accommodation, health and racism, will resolve themselves more easily.  We need to be under no illusion that in addressing the issue of Traveller unemployment, there needs to be targeted State investment in strategic programmes and projects.  These programmes and projects need to go the extra mile to achieve the desired outcomes.  They need to be led by a Traveller organisation.  Having said that, the investment will be cost neutral.  As progress is made in reducing the 80% unemployment figure, there will be payback for the State.<br\/><br\/>I suggest that we take serious note of the fact that 20% of Travellers who are eligible for the labour market are employed against all odds.  This dispels the nonsensical myth that Travellers want to be on social welfare.  Travellers are employed in roles such as landscape gardeners, labourers, security personnel, general practitioners and barristers.  I will not go through every line of my prepared statement because I would be covering some of the stuff that has already been mentioned by other speakers.<br\/><br\/>I would like to mention a case study.  Two Traveller men in their mid-20s applied to a local pharmaceutical company for employment.  They both had qualifications from a third level institution to help them to get an interview.  They submitted their CVs and letters of application with support from their third level tutor, but they received no further communication from the company.  Their tutor advised them to reapply using their Irish language names and the home addresses of the tutor and a colleague.  Both of them were interviewed and subsequently employed.  When their probationary period was completed after six months, the tutor made contact with the head of recruitment in the company to discuss what had happened.  The head of human resources acknowledged that when the CVs were originally submitted, he did not review them after he saw their names and address.  He acknowledged that both men, who are still employed by the company today, are excellent employees.  This is an example of the practical experiences of Travellers.<br\/><br\/>I would like to speak about access to employment services and the adequacy of funding for these services.  In recent years, there have been well-funded initiatives to help unemployed people to return to work, primarily via Seetec, Turas Nua, the social inclusion and community activation programme, and previously the local employment services.  In general, these initiatives have had very limited success with the Traveller community.  Anecdotally, our information suggests that most employment liaison people do not believe that Travellers will be employed.  They are beaten from the gate.  It should be taken into account that mainstream services have failed the Traveller community.  As a community, Travellers do not have great faith in such services and their engagement can be sporadic.  As employment services are generally centre-based, they do not engage in outreach work with communities.  The initial approach of any employment and enterprise agency with the Traveller community needs to begin with where Travellers can be found in their communities and must involve collaboration with local Traveller community development groups.  That is the starting point.  Involve is currently engaged in a number of pilot employment projects in Ballina, Longford and Tullamore.<\/p><p>We are also researching different working approaches over the last 20 years to address long-term unemployment.  We have been to the UK and looked at initiatives in London and Manchester.  We will compile a report with more detailed recommendations on our findings from this work in early 2020.<\/p><p> Among the barriers and challenges to gaining employment identified by young Traveller and Roma people were that they had little or no experience of working and the employers were looking for experienced workers.  They also referred to low levels of education and skills; employers who would not give them a chance; low pay for young people; not knowing what work they wanted to do; not liking having a boss; and wanting work to be practical and not to involve much paperwork.  That was the young people's feedback around employment.  The barriers identified in the recent report, What Next for Traveller Employment?, referred to inadequate public services, discrimination, education not being viewed as the best route to income generation, and the pragmatic issue that Traveller culture is not taken into account.<\/p><p> On the recommendations, as the chairman of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy employment subgroup, I believe the strategy needs to be supported by a small fund to help deliver on its work, and representation from trade unions and employers also needs to be achieved.  All Government Departments and public bodies identified in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy's employment actions must actively engage and deliver on their remit.  The actions are listed out and it is the responsibility of Departments to step up to the mark on them.  We also need champions in the public service and Civil Service and positive affirmative actions similar to the disabilities champion in the Public Appointments Service.<\/p><p> There is a requirement for an internship traineeship apprenticeship model of recruitment via the Public Appointments Service for all Departments, with set targets for Traveller recruitment and support in the early stages of employment.  There are many individual examples of positive affirmation actions that should be replicated.  There were champions at senior level in all cases.  One such case that is always cited is that of the late Joe Horan and the changes he made on South Dublin County Council.  Interestingly, Tusla has realised that it needs to have Travellers trained as social workers in order to provide foster care supports.  Tusla now has an initiative in place to support young Travellers going through third level education in that regard.  It is very practical and makes sense.  Again, it is an example of somebody taking action.<\/p><p> There is also a requirement for a targeted fund to be established and tendered for, with a clear outcome of reducing Traveller unemployment, initially by 50% over the next six years.  This would be an increase from 2,112 employed to 5,326 employed.  Pilot programmes could initially be established, as outlined in a proposal submitted under the Dormant Accounts Fund scheme and which is part of our larger submission to the committee.<\/p><p> Finally, we suggest that quotas be put in place for Traveller employment.  Government Departments, public bodies, agencies and NGOs funded by the State should have quotas for employing Travellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reilly for those very practical suggestions.

Members are probably wondering what I am doing here.<\/p><p>It is a completely different context.  My area is social enterprise, which has been part of social policy in Europe since the early 1990s and has addressed issues of unemployment, in particular in areas where there are major barriers to employment such as multigenerational unemployment and marginalised groups that are discriminated against, including people who have been incarcerated or have experienced periods of homelessness.  There are various situations in which people might find barriers to employment that are more systemic than individual.<\/p><p> This summer a new policy for social enterprise in Ireland was launched.  We advised on how best to roll that out, under the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  A national conference on social enterprise in Ireland was held in November.  While there is a rich and active social enterprise sector here, there is a lack of data and we do not quite know what the numbers are.  Benefacts is a database of civil society organisations.  A search for Traveller organisations on it shows there are just over 5,000, but they are not all social enterprises.  They include various community groups and other groups of all kinds.  The database includes small community type groups as well as larger NGOs.<\/p><p> Some mapping exercises have taken place to try to determine what kind of social enterprises are in existence, but there is no overall picture.  Beyond that, we are not sure of the impact of social enterprise on a macro level and how effective the policies are.  We have data from other countries which show that social enterprise is an effective strategy for dealing with issues of unemployment as part of social policy.  However, we do not yet have many data on that for Ireland.  We hope to develop that.<\/p><p> I have been a board member of Shuttle Knit, a social enterprise that employs Traveller women in Wicklow town.  It was founded in 2001 and I joined last month.  I am fairly new to the area, although I have worked with other Traveller organisations over the years as I was involved in the non-profit sector for 12 years.  I have since moved on to academia to study non-profit organisations.<\/p><p> The purpose of Shuttle Knit is to support Traveller women in Wicklow town through employment.  It builds on their existing skills of knitting and embroidery.  It employs 12 women, ten from the Travelling community and two from the settled community.  It is a partnership.  One of the benefits is that it was founded by the Wicklow Travellers Group, with an understanding of the barriers to employment.  It is located in a community centre owned and run by the Wicklow Travellers Group.  It is very much a safe space where people from the Traveller community can go knowing that they will not be discriminated against.  As we heard in the other submissions today, discrimination is a major problem. <\/p><p> Through their experience at Shuttle Knit, the women take part in various training opportunities.  They can take part in literacy training and training specific to the work they are doing, such as digitalised embroidery.  All of the crests for schools and sports clubs in the area are now done by Shuttle Knit.  The women work with shops on the high street to get orders for crests, which is a source of employment.   The training on the digital part of the process is an added aspect, rather than just doing embroidery.  <\/p><p> I will outline another specific example of one of the benefits of the project.  The women in Shuttle Knit recently took part in an initiative which did not specifically come from the project, namely, an international excursion to Lourdes.  It may sound unrelated to social enterprise or not important, but it was of significant benefit to the women, many of whom had never been on an aeroplane before.  Many had never travelled outside the country and several got passports for the first time.  It shows the empowering effect of being part of an organisation where women are employed and have skills.<\/p><p> There are different ways to classify social enterprise.  One is the relationship between the mission and revenue generation.<\/p><p>Shuttle Knit is mission-centred.  That means that the means of generating revenue is the same as the mission, as opposed to a charity shop run by a cancer charity, which is not related to the mission but exists to raise funding.  The advantage of having the mission as the means of generating revenue is that it is very empowering for the people involved.  That might be a subtle distinction but it is quite a significant one when categorising social enterprises.<\/p><p> Regarding capacity building, we find a difference between generations.  Some of the women who were first employed there are learning and advancing their skills in knitting.  That is not necessarily training them for future employment.  For them to have this experience is beneficial in itself.  They are part of a community and they can take part in literacy training and other events.  Moreover, their daughters see them employed.  That has an intergenerational knock-on effect.  We cannot judge the impact of social enterprise merely based on whether it trains people to enter the mainstream labour market.  In some cases the answer is \"No\", and that is fine.  We have to look at the longer-term impact.  There is no massive hand-knitting industry in Ireland.  We are not training people to work in knitting companies or to be their CEOs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sheila Cannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Why not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#N00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Why not indeed?

I hope I can remember them all.  I will start with Dr. Cannon because she was the last speaker.  I have a huge interest in the area of social enterprise.  Ireland is very far behind other EU countries when it comes to the culture of social enterprise.  I wonder if we are creating another system.  I believe in social enterprise and I work in social enterprises, but I see the number of middle-class people who make applications to, say, the Department of Justice and Equality, which recently offered funding for social enterprises, or other such avenues.  Income is created for the person who has the idea.  Some of the funding streams allow a social entrepreneur to generate his or her own income while running a social enterprise like Shuttle Knit.  I am just using Shuttle Knit as an example.  Is enough being done to empower Travellers to build their own social enterprises so that they are the founders, they are the ones applying for funding, and they are the ones benefiting from the top level of income generated by them?  I fear we are creating another system to benefit very middle-class people who are comfortable with applications and systems and who have connections in the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>  We are not necessarily helping the most vulnerable groups to be the designers of their own social enterprises.  I am thinking of the equestrian centre in Tallaght.  I can look out at the Dublin Mountains right behind my house.  Tallaght has a huge Traveller population and none of us is doing anything connected to horses or horse riding lessons at the foot of those hills.  It really bothers me.  Are we doing enough to ensure that social enterprises and social entrepreneurs within the Traveller community are developed and supported, rather than just providing them with another service?<\/p><p> That is a question on social enterprises.  I believe in the concept of them and the circular economy.  I would cite the example of women who gain income from knitting or sewing.  While the intergenerational impact of such social enterprise is one of the important pieces of the puzzle, those who knit or sew are fearful of losing income benefit as they would not be gaining enough income to earn a living from knitting or sewing.  Are we doing enough to ensure those women are no longer petrified of the State intervening and removing their social welfare benefits because the social enterprise in which they are engaged has brought them over the income limit allowed but the income they gain from it is not enough for them to sustain a living from it?  The feel-good factor from engaging in social enterprise is always great but how do we measure the impact of it on those engaged in it in terms of progression?<\/p><p> Perhaps Ms Sherlock, Mr. Reilly or Mr. Power might answer a question I have regarding employment.  We know people have confidence, numeracy and literacy issues all due to having been failed to date by the education system.  Regardless of those issues, do they think there is still a stigma attached when it comes to employment?  Mr. O'Leary pointed to this when he referred to the employment application process for the pharmaceutical sector where, regardless of those applicants' numeracy and literacy skills, Travellers would not have been employed in that sector in any event.  A person nearly has to create his or her own employment.  What work is needed to address the stigma issue in society, including among employers, so that Travellers would be employed in the mainstream workforce, be it in the retail sector, the pharmaceutical sector or in the teaching profession?<\/p><p> In relating the following, I am in no way comparing the Travelling community to the people concerned in the other work in which I am engaged.  I have been doing a large body of work on people with minor convictions in their backgrounds.  We found the biggest challenge was to address this issue with employers.  We have had events where only people with past convictions developed and worked the event but the employers who attended it did not know that.  They were being served all night by people who had past convictions.  They did not have a clue.  We had to push past those employers' preconceptions and show them they were losing out on the great potential these people presented and whom they would dismiss simply because they had a conviction in their background.  How can we begin to address that issue with employers?<\/p><p> I was petrified when I brought those employers into the room with those people in my community, whom I love and care about and who I had got to work the event.  I was afraid of the conversations.  I was petrified I was walking my friends and the people I care about into a situation where those employers would say they would not have those people work for them because they would only rob their shop because they had been locked up for thieving.  I probably feel overly protective of them, but as the night wore on, that did not happen, my fears did not come to pass and those employers got to address their bias and preconceived ideas about people.  How can we do more of that integration work with employers and have those conversations?  Quotas are very important and I would love to know how others feel about quotas in respect of Traveller employment or in any sphere in terms of the Traveller community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#N00700","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>The Senator asked questions on social enterprise and ensuring the people directly concerned gain from that rather such gain going sideways to the middle class or others.

We have been calling for a long time for intercultural training for staff.  Something we have been pushing for is the ethnic identifier, which came out of almost all the submissions to the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary referred to examples.  I know Travellers who are doing security work and they have told me that they have been trained how to watch out for Travellers and Roma.  That is all part of the training.  Travellers are in security jobs and are being trained to watch out for Travellers and Roma in particular.  That is sad because these men want the work.  They are not confident enough to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Traveller and what you&rsquo;re doing is wrong.&rdquo;  They have to make ends meet.<\/p><p>That is the harsh reality.  They are hiding their identity.<\/p><p> On the integration strategy for Travellers and Roma, it has to be across the board.  Children going to school are our future doctors and solicitors.  We cannot talk about employment without education.  The two are linked.  We see that on the ground.  One of the saddest things I heard as a Traveller was from my nephew, who got good results in the leaving certificate examinations.  He said he cannot get any work and is struggling, even in respect of work experience.  His younger siblings are hearing this and asking what the point is.<\/p><p> Therefore, mainstreaming and the ethnic identifier have to be considered, and the intercultural piece.  We get asked questions all the time and are sick and tired of having to defend the negative, but we have a lot of positives.  Mr. Hogan spoke about that.  There are vibrant young Travellers who want to work and go into the mainstream.  The Chairman asked why not.  A whole-of-government approach is required from grassroots level to the top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>There has to be a national strategy.  Travellers have been completely left out of the labour market.  They have not been considered part of it forever.  Travellers, by nature, work in social enterprise.  They would have worked in a family unit, whether it was collecting scrap or, in our case, at the beach.  We picked winkles and sold them.  That was our business.  It was a family business.  From a young age, Travellers worked collectively for the good of the family.  This has started to change, simply because there are no jobs.  The types of social enterprise that existed in the past no longer exist.<\/p> <p>  I was very glad I was asked about accessing employment.  I know Travellers whose parents have put in a great effort to ensure their children would go to school.  The children attend school every day and have never missed a day.  I will give two examples.  The children of one family whose children went to school every day came out barely literate.  Therefore, the system has completely failed not only the children but also the family and their expectations.  It is wasting children's time and setting them up for failure if they are not being taught and steered towards being productive, contributing members of society.<\/p> <p>  We encounter Travellers who are not even able to get a job in a supermarket.  There are examples of young fellows who came out of school and who did not get jobs in supermarkets that they had applied for, although their friends got them.  The supermarkets may still be advertising positions but the Travellers will not get them.  I encountered the case a young Traveller girl who looked for work experience in a second-hand shop but who was told she could not get it.  The turnaround in the shop is high.  We have to have a national strategy, therefore.  From a Traveller perspective, there is a need to send children to school not just for the sake of it but to have an education that will result in employment.  We also need to consider this from a Government perspective and deal with the barriers.  There has to be a national strategy.<\/p> <p>  Travellers are getting corralled into dead ends, for the most part.  It does not affect Travellers alone as people in deprived areas are experiencing exactly the same thing.  The education system is failing them.  They are unable to get jobs.  The outcomes, therefore, will be dead-end outcomes.  The outcome will be over-dependence on the State.  There is a high risk of addiction, depression and suicide because people cannot cope.  A small percentage are engaging in antisocial behaviour or crime.  That is where they are being corralled, however.  We blame people for being at their destination without considering all the contributing factors that got them there.  We need a national strategy.  It is not always a question of education as there are those who are well trained and well qualified but who cannot find a job.<\/p><p>Employment needs to be targeted to address that.<\/p><p> To return to an earlier point, there needs to be diversity.  One size will not fit all.  Some people are already trained, educated and ready to enter employment, while others are competent, capable and talented in specific areas.  Some Travellers can strip apart a car and put it back together with a blindfold, some know everything about horses, while some young female beauticians are naturally talented in various areas.  Such people just need a little training towards qualification to fill that gap because they are naturally talented in their areas.  It is a different strategy but we need a national strategy to deal with employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>There need to be pathways to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#Q00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":664,"content":"<p>To echo what Ms Sherlock and Mr. Reilly stated, there are five and six year old Traveller children in primary school who are not asked what they want to be when they are older because there is an expectation that soon after they enter secondary school, they will leave in any event.  We need to change the culture within the education system and how Travellers are viewed therein because it can have a severe knock-on effect on confidence, not least when a child in fifth or sixth class is asked to make a decision as to which secondary school he or she will attend.  It does not matter to the Traveller child because by second or third year, he or she will want to leave.  If a five or six year old child says he or she wants to be a firefighter, garda, solicitor or doctor, he or she should be supported in doing so, but unfortunately our education system excludes Travellers to an extent and does not give the appropriate supports, as we all know.<\/p> <p>  At the tail end of education, many more Travellers come through secondary school, but that is not necessarily good.  More Travellers are now illiterate after finishing secondary school than ever before, a category I fell into.  I have dyspraxia and dyslexia but that was not picked up until I entered third level education or even thereafter.  We promote third level education but some people who graduate cannot find meaningful employment unless they are within Traveller organisations.  I do not how many CVs I have handed out to State organisations without hearing anything in response.  The only meaningful employment I have ever had was with non-governmental organisations.  That is not a good message to send to any Traveller, given the time and commitment it takes to attend education and sit exams and the stress that causes.  Moreover, a person must take a break if he or she wants to start a family, particularly in the case of women, and that can cause stress.<\/p> <p>  We must encourage Travellers to stay in secondary school, because otherwise it will be a significant barrier.  We cannot promise there will be jobs for them because the likelihood is that if they want to go into business or to the private sector, including anything apart from community development or social care, they will be on social welfare when they leave third level education.  That is not acceptable and we need to examine it strategically to support Travellers and to challenge the barriers of discrimination and biases.  Many positive aspects are emerging from our community but they are never highlighted.  It is always negative and we always have to explain what people in Longford or from a different culture do, even though I am from Cork.  We are all tarred with the same brush and employers see that.

We are seeing the shaping of the next pathways to work programme for 2020 to 2024.  There are some really deep structural decisions that need to be made in that context which will in fact determine whether any of these innovations will work.  Take the case of the pay-by-results mechanisms in place, for example, with JobPath.  If organisations are geared towards having to deliver services in the context of being paid by results, it leads to creaming and parking.  It also leads to Travellers being dumped on the side because they are considered to be too much work to get the result from to put it crudely.  There are some key structural issues such as this.<\/p> <p>  Even the metrics for success, such as is the programme of getting people into employment or intergenerational equality and sustainment, need to be considered.  On the length of intervention needed, people are cycled through JobPath, Intreo and the local employment service.  They get a year in each and then they are moved from institution to institution.  All the evidence shows that for many of these good interventions to work, people need a lengthy intervention where they can actually get a sustainable pathway back to work of three or four years.

I spent 18 years of my life working for what effectively was a community co-op.  We started with nothing and built it up.  Over that time, I saw people developing.  People got a week's work and then a year&rsquo;s work.  Then some of them went out on their own to become successful.  I was working in a rural area with high unemployment at the time.  Now it has extremely low unemployment.  We must recognise that we have to build into the future and take a long-term perspective.<\/p> <p>  Listening to the debate, it seems that if we look at Travellers as a community, one has a young enough coming group who we would hope will get better education and, therefore, their future should be one of more choice.  The second group are those who are already adults, be they on their 20s or their 60s, who have finished their education and are unlikely to go back into it.  It might happen in the future depending on how one builds it up.  One has to look at the different groups and pick each person individually deciding what is the best for the individual rather than everybody together.  There will be as many choices as there are people.<\/p> <p>  Having run a community organisation which had a commercial aspect as well as a social aspect at the same time, I am firmly of the view that everybody &ndash; this does not just apply to Travellers - should have an opportunity to work.  I do not agree with work programmes which force people to work.  That is absolutely negative.  Everybody should have an opportunity to work.  My experience is that if one gives people a reasonable opportunity, they will take it.  There could be a few quick wins which would be in the gift of the State.<\/p><p>Currently, if one gets onto a CE or T&uacute;s scheme the time is limited, no matter how well a person has worked and no matter how important their job; if one does not progress, as society defines progression, one has to go.  Someone might look after the local community centre and keep it open, making it available every day and it does not matter whether or not they are replaceable, it is still a case of \"out you go\".  Someone might be employed elsewhere as exactly the same thing as an employee and there would be no limitation.  Perhaps starting with target groups, there should be no limit to the time one spends on the scheme.  I initially set up T&uacute;s in December of 2010 and I was gone by February 2011.  I took what I was getting but I did not agree with Finance's one-year rule.  What was meant to happen was that an individual would get on a CE scheme for three years, get training and if he or she had performed well but had not got a commercial job, he or she would transfer to T&uacute;s and get a job providing some vital service to communities, which would be of indefinite duration.  If a person got another job, obviously he or she would move on but if not, they would stay where they were.  <\/p><p> Dr. Cann's reference to the social economy is interesting.  The biggest social economy scheme in the country is the community services programme.  I had quite a bit of experience with that.  Its big advantage is that a person who is on the programme can stay on indefinitely.  They can get the minimum wage and a company can pay one extra if they can earn the money, and they must have an income.  Unfortunately, job initiative, which was also a good scheme, has been run down systematically.  We should have a big increase in community service programmes because there are many services which will never be economic, such as heritage facilities.  Dr. Cann also mentioned Wicklow.  I have some connection with Wicklow.  I went down to visit them in their early days, when I think they were in Bray.  They asked me if they could get sewing machines.  We went to the ESB and asked if it had any sewing machines lying around somewhere.  It had a whole heap of sewing machines so we got them for the project and I am glad to hear it is still working well.  There is also a very good scheme in Galway which is totally Traveller run, from the management down.  It was set up in my time and the model has been proven very effective.  It has broken into a particular business which I will not mention here which one would not normally associate with male Travellers, and which people would think unlikely because of social prejudice.  It has been hugely successful in getting the job done.  There is much that we can do in those and I would be interested in Dr. Cann's reaction.  <\/p><p> Work experience in the private sector is a huge opportunity.  My experience of work experience was that if one got someone in who was good, one would get them a job or one would retain them.  It is important that people can get in there and prove their worth.  We have discussed internships in the public service, including in this House, among ourselves.  It is absolutely vital. <\/p><p> I hate JobPath.  I have a total aversion to it.  Most people who get jobs through JobPath would have got the jobs anyway.  It is a total waste of money.  I have my suspicions about JobPath because people come to me who were called for JobPath who did not want to go to it for their own reasons, which might be valid but I have many Travellers who come to my office every week - a high percentage of those who come to my office are Travellers - but JobPath has never come to me for Travellers.  I wonder whether Travellers are actually being called for JobPath or if there was a subtle, quiet instruction to the effect that \"we do not want those\".   I do not think that it is a good model that gets people into employment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#R00900","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":678,"content":"<p>We will get some reaction to the Deputy's interesting ideas.

We need to look at the skills of adult Travellers of both sexes and match employment to skills either through employment or self-employment.  We have disempowered every type of self-employment a Traveller ever got involved in.  Some of it has been conscious disempowering.  For example, Travellers in my area used to sell things outside sporting matches and so on.  We introduced licences and then refused to grant the licences.<\/p><p> There is one final thing I have a problem with.  In the old days individuals were simply appointed to State boards and one could say that that was abused.  However, I do not like the present system because it selects the person who has the best paper qualifications, not who is the best person or who is the best person matched to the board.  It is leading to a gentrification of State boards.  The PAS looks at CVs and appoints a person who has enough degrees, work experience or whatever.  This means the boards no longer do what they were designed to do, which is to represent the totality of society.

The older generation of Travellers were seen to be uneducated because they do not have a piece of paper.  A great model is being used in third level institutions at the moment - recognition of prior learning, RPL.  We need something like that within employment so that Travellers can go for jobs based on their experience, such as within the horse industry.  Travellers are one of the most skilled minorities in this country and with the knowledge they have particularly around horses, they could contribute in a very beneficial way to the horse industry both professionally and for leisure.<\/p> <p>  The community employment, CE, scheme is not working for Travellers.  They give employment and provide resources for training, but the time runs out and Travellers end up seeking social welfare again because they are unemployed.  We need to have resources put in place, not just resources in terms of time but also in education and training.  That needs to be provided for Travellers within the CE scheme.  It also needs to lead to employment.  We need to support those individuals gain access to employment or even setting up employment within house.  We have a lot of community development workers.  Many good people on CE schemes would be great for the organisations they are currently in, but unfortunately their time runs out, they go home and the opportunity is lost.<\/p> <p>  There is considerable emphasis on the social enterprise stuff.<\/p><p>The lads in Galway are doing it right.

I was at something not completely unrelated.  I am part of the Oireachtas Women's Caucus, as are the Chair and Senator Ruane.  Today's meeting concerned trying to set up caucuses within our counties with local women who have been elected to councils and other community groups.  It struck me then when I came in that there should be input from local Traveller women to those caucuses.  I apologise to the gentlemen here, but this concerns how women can progress issues in respect of their local authorities.<\/p> <p>  The figures are stark.  It is horrific in this day and age and in this society that some 80% of Travellers are unemployed.  I have met Mr. Reilly a number of times in connection with the education committee, where we have examined many issues regarding education for Travellers and other vulnerable groups.  I refer in particular to reduced timetables.  There is certainly a linkage.  One of the people who will forever be in my mind presented at that session, and I know that Senator Ruane will agree with me.  I refer to a young Traveller boy who came from Galway to speak to us about his experience.  All he wanted in life was to be a community garda, from the time he saw a garda in his community.  I understand that in many cases Travellers may feel alienated from the garda&iacute;.  This young man, however, fell in love with the uniform and consistently met and was asking garda&iacute; about how he could become a community guard, what is the job and what is the focus.<\/p><p>He also spoke about how a homework club had completely turned around his life.  This was a homework club set up in the city for young Travellers.  He believes that because of it, he now has a realistic chance of becoming a community garda.  I have no doubt that he will become one and that when he does it will have an impact on the people in the Traveller community who feel alienated from the Garda.  As a former teacher who taught Traveller children in an integrated setting, I was always aware that many of the children's parents did not like coming to the school because they felt alienated from it.  They would feel much more involved and welcome if we had Traveller teachers within the system.  I am not 100% convinced about segregated employment.  While it has worked in the past and there may be some need for it, integration is the key, but I accept that may take a generation.  We need to have a quota of Traveller teachers in the system.  <\/p><p> I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on a possible quota for State jobs.  I agree that there should be a quota.  I know a young man who joined the Army and has had a really good career.  His children are now in third level education.  This man did not get to join the Army on the basis of a quota.  He applied to join and was successful, which is a better system.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses views on the State jobs where a quota would be useful.  <\/p><p> On internships, I was involved in setting up the internship scheme in Leinster House for people with a disability.  It has been incredibly successful.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned that there is no reason we could not run an internship in Leinster House.  Would it be a good idea or, again, is that singling out Travellers in a way that they may not want to be singled out?

One of big deficits in the Pathways to Work model is that there is no a governance system to oversee it.  There was a labour market council but it was stood down.  There is some consideration being given to reconstituting that council.  It largely comprised civil servants and some employers.  Direct representation of Traveller and other groups experiencing particular challenges relating to employment is very important in that respect.  One example relates to the quota.  Who sets it and would there be Traveller input into that?  What sort of supports are needed to make a quota work?  One of the problems with quotas as they are currently set is that they are not working in practice because none of the underlying supports to enable people to stay in positions once they get in is there.  Post-employment sustainability for quotas is really important.<\/p> <p>  In the past there was talk of a job offer guarantee and a former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was around at that time.  If there is the idea of owing the value to the Traveller community for the banishment it experienced from the larger society, a job offer guarantee could be meaningful.  It could come in the form of a quota, internships, social enterprises and a wide range of opportunities.  The idea of a guarantee of an opportunity could be very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>It is something we could certainly consider in our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#Y00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575936000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I met representatives from the Public Appointments Service in the past when it developed an inclusion and diversity strategy.  One of the points I made is that having a generic inclusion and diversity strategy would most likely mean Travellers would be left out again.  We have a major blind spot in this regard so there must be targeted initiatives to support the Traveller community.  We speak about the Public Appointments Service but we only get these people to the door; it is up to Departments to tell us what they want.  The Public Appointments Service does as it is requested by the different Departments.  At one point, two Traveller ladies were on an internship with the public service.  They were doing extremely well in their work and they got on well with their colleagues.  They liked working there and their colleagues liked working with them.  It all sounded good.  The computer kept saying \"No\" to them.  I suggested to the Public Appointments Service that it was way behind the curve with that computer.  Other countries are going further down the road with regard to internships and apprenticeships and the service must open that avenue if it really wants diversity.<\/p> <p>  We heard a statistic to the effect that only 10% of employers would give Travellers a job.  I could be wrong but if we had a targeted initiative, it is most likely there would be more than enough employers to employ Travellers.  We need a targeted service to find these numbers.  The roles must be researched and people must be pulled out from wherever they are.  A targeted service is really important if we are to see progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. James O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>To the editor of the magazine I say \"Fair play\".

Many of the issues that we see developing and which Travellers must deal with, including addiction, suicide and depression, are by-products of a rejection by society.  Many of those will start to fall away when we see people being treated a little better and having opportunities around employment.<\/p><p>One of our colleagues, who sits on our council, works in the Prison Service.  The number of people in prison, not just Travellers, who are basically illiterate is unbelievable.  Would these people have taken the direction they took and ended up in the destination point they are at if the system had started to support them at a much earlier age?  For the vast majority of them the answer is probably \"No\".<\/p><p> This comes back to how we value people in society.  Do we value Travellers and people from working class and disadvantaged areas in the same way as we value people from other sections of society?  The reality is, and the evidence shows, that we do not.  Some people are set up for success while others are set up for failure.  We need to level it out and understand that there are long-term consequences.  If we fail children at a very young age, many of them will become a burden on society whereas, with the right supports, they could be an asset to society.  Each and every one of us has skills, abilities and talents and we should have the opportunity to contribute them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019121000002#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575936000,"counter":727,"content":"<p>The first thing I did when I became the Minister for Social Protection was ask the chief medical office whether he had evidence on the effect of unemployment on people's health.  His stark one-page reply stated that people who are unemployed suffered increased mortality and morbidity, visit the doctor more and take more medication, etc.  He also made the interesting point that securing employment provides a 99% cure.  Employment is part of human existence.  We are programmed in our DNA to work so why tell one community that its is more or less excluded from employment?<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that community employment, T&uacute;s and other schemes are the limit for anybody.  As far as I am concerned, a human's limit should be where he or she wants to go and where he or she is capable of going.  We should give people the maximum opportunity to go there.  However, we must recognise that we have a cohort of people who have been so disadvantaged in life that to even get useful employment doing useful work in a State-supported system is hugely important.  The key point the witnesses made was that the next generation benefits hugely from their parents being out working.  That was my life's experience.

We have spent a really interesting couple of hours discussing this matter and we will spend more time discussing three more modules.  The 80% unemployment rate among Travellers is beyond shocking.  When one says it is shocking that almost sounds banal and trivialises this issue.  We have no choice but not to leave Travellers where they are, as Mr. Reilly so eloquently put it.<\/p> <p>  The Pathways to Work review is a clear opportunity.   Travellers need to have a meaningful role in this, with programmes that work for them.  We need a range of targeted and generic interventions.  We need mainstream access but we also need specialised and specific assistance.  We need the whole gamut of interventions if we are tackle the current rate of 80% unemployment.  I heard what was said about quotas but they should only be introduced in consultation with the Traveller community.  Interns must be paid and internships must be meaningful, rather than just a box-ticking exercise.  Work experience in the private sector opens doors.  The social capital that children gain through work experience and in school and university is huge in terms of their future prospects and getting into the workplace.<\/p><p>We have to name and tackle the prejudice that exists in society and carries into the workplace.
