We will be dealing with Brexit all day.  <\/p> <p>It is said a week is a long time in politics, but the past 24 hours have been very long and eventful in the politics of Brexit.  The recently published suggestion that the British Government allow goods to move freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland but not between the Republic of Ireland and mainland Britain without tariffs is very challenging.  When the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, spoke on radio this morning, he said it would be an absolute disaster.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, said it would be absolutely disastrous.  A no-deal Brexit is still a lose-lose proposition for all of us, including the United Kingdom which could not benefit from it in the slightest.  It is important to recognise that 48% of our beef, 21% of our dairy produce, 46% of our cheddar cheese and almost 100% of our mushrooms are exported to the United Kingdom.  The plan not to have tariffs on trade with the North but to have them on trade with mainland Britain would absolutely decimate the agrifood sector.  The president of the IFA, Mr. Joe Healy, has mentioned how difficult it would be.  We know and understand why the Minister, Deputy Creed; the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney; the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and other members of Government are away.  It is important that they fly the flag for Ireland across the globe, but the British Government's publication of tariffs has ramped up the situation in a very negative way.  If there is a vote in the House of Commons to prevent a no-deal Brexit, I hope it will be passed.  I would still prefer Article 50-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#A00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The outcome of such a vote would not be legally binding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#A00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I know, but it would reflect the will of Parliament.  I hope the Government might at least consider this.  <\/p> <p>I will raise again a point I made yesterday.  As I said, 24 hours is a long time in politics.  I mentioned that I did not want to get into a row with Mr. Michael O'Leary and I still do not want to do so, but in the past 24 hours we have seen the European Union and Ireland and the United Kingdom individually ban for the moment the use of Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.  They are banned not only from landing at or taking off from airports in these jurisdictions but also from flying through their airspace.  Approximately 350 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft have been delivered, but orders have been placed for more than 5,000, including 135 for Ryanair, with the option to buy another 70.  Ryanair is due to take delivery of the aircraft in April and May.  It is important to recognise that Ryanair has an outstanding safety record, as does Aer Lingus.  Ryanair has never been involved in an incident involving fatalities.  It provides an absolutely fantastic service, but all of the people who use it regularly, including me, would probably prefer not to fly in these aircraft until the investigations have concluded.  Whatever glitch in the software or other issue caused aircraft only a few months old to be involved in very similar incidents just after take-off needs to be reflected on.  Mr. O'Leary has said he has not yet changed his plans, but it is important that he take on board the concerns of the entire world's aviation sector, particularly those involved in it in Europe, Asia and other areas which have banned the aircraft.  For the continued safety and comfort of all of the passengers who fly with Ryanair, he might postpone taking delivery of the new aircraft until the problems have been clarified, explained and sorted out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#A00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>For once there is a positive story about the Defence Forces this morning.

We need extensive consultation with the inshore fishermen before the Bill comes before us as otherwise, it will be rejected.  We must listen to the inshore fishermen and their families.<\/p><p>Today, I want to talk about sodium valproate or Epilim, which is a medication used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  The European Medicines Agency has restricted its use in women due to the increased risk of disabilities in children exposed to valproate in the womb.  These disabilities are collectively known as foetal valproate syndrome and can include serious developmental disorders in between 30% and 40% of cases and congenital malformations in approximately 10% of cases.  Data suggest that up to 1,250 children may have been born with valproate-related disabilities since the medication was licensed in Ireland in 1975.<\/p><p>Last year, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health produced a report on foetal valproate syndrome and the HSE established the valproate response project group to address a range of issues such as prevention, risk minimisation, establishing incidence, diagnosis and supports for the families affected.  On 22 March, a major conference on the consequences of sodium valproate or Epilim 50 years on will be held in Trinity College.  I encourage all Senators and the media to attend because there is something to see here and something to hear.<\/p><p>The Minister for Health told me at a meeting of the joint committee that he would consider the need for an inquiry into foetal valproate syndrome as soon as the HSE's valproate response team completed its work.  Therefore, we need to know when its work will be completed and when he expects to further consider the matter.<\/p><p>A redress scheme has been set up in France to compensate the families and individuals who have been affected by foetal valproate syndrome.  It is urgent that we take a similar initiative here.  The Minister must meet the foetal anticonvulsant syndrome, FACS, forum, to discuss accountability issues, as well as redress and I ask him to outline the following.  How long has his Department known about the risks associated with the use of valproate in pregnancy?  What actions were taken by the State to minimise these risks, in particular prior to 2014 when the European Medicines Agency implemented its first review of risk reduction measures?  What is his response to the recent study published in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>that concluded there was clear evidence as far back as 1990 that there were risks of congenital malformations in women exposed to valproate, and that the risks were beyond all doubt from 2005?  Will he explain what is known about the prevalence of foetal valproate syndrome within the Irish population?  What clinical trials were conducted on Epilim or sodium valproate in Ireland prior to its licensing in 1975?  If no trials were conducted in the State, what clinical trial data were used as a basis for its approval?<\/p><p>Many questions remain to be answered about valproate and they must be answered.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to come into the House to discuss this matter.  We have waited long enough for the report.  In the meantime, I encourage everybody to attend the conference.  I commend the mothers, some of whom will be in here this evening, who have campaigned long and hard about this matter.  We have families where two or three children were born with disabilities because their mothers were allowed to take valproate when they were pregnant. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#B00600","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Last Sunday, I spoke at a meeting held on O'Connell Street to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Chinese invasion of Tibet.  Under this the Chinese militarily absorbed a friendly neighbouring country into its regime.<\/p> <p>I remember, in 1959, listening to the broadcast of the BBC as it followed the heroic trek by the Dalai Lama across the Himalayas to India.  Thirty years ago I went on a semi-secret mission to Tibet for the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, UNPO, to write a report on human rights.  The first thing I noticed on landing in Lhasa was an enormous Chinese cement factory, which was really a small city belching out smoke.  The second thing I recognised was that there were military camps all over the place with loudspeakers broadcasting Chinese propaganda.  In addition, the road signs that warned of avalanches, broken roads and so on were all in the Chinese language and not in the Tibetan language.  The Chinese obviously did not give a damn about the safety or the lives of the Tibetan people.  In the Potala Palace, one of the monks secretly handed me a little piece of paper on which was written the words \"We are not Chinese.  We are Tibetan.  We love the Dalai Lama\".  He was an immensely courageous man because he could have been executed for such an act.<\/p> <p>What has happened in Tibet is a plantation and we, in this country, know the sorry history of plantations.  Five hundred years later we are still dealing with the effective plantations in this country.  Now, as a result of Chinese action, there are more Han Chinese in Tibet than there are Tibetans, which is a tragic, squalid and ghastly situation.<\/p> <p>Frank Aiken, who was Minister for External Affairs, supported Tibet but he also even-handedly supported the inclusion of Red China in the United Nations.  However, over the years, as a result of pressure from civil servants, the Irish policy has completed changed and been whittled away until now, we ignore Tibet completely.  We have abandoned Tibet and recognise instead the \"one China\" policy.  I am ashamed, as an Irishman, that we have done this because we done it for purely financial motives and it is a disgrace.  It is also a disgrace that this violent change of policy was never referred to an Irish Parliament and I seek a debate on this issue.<\/p> <p>I will make just one comment on Brexit.  It seems extraordinary to me that the British would ramp up tariffs at this stage.  This is an act of aggression and is a very aggressive position for Britain to take.  They are basically talking about annihilating our beef industry.  This is not the action of a friendly country and I take my hat off to the calm resolution of our Irish negotiators.  We should be very firm on this matter.  I wonder that if this should ever come about what steps the European Union will take to counter such action, because there must be countermeasures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not want a trade war, but if it is what they want, it is what they will get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#B00700","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Yesterday, it was 30 years since the coming into existence of the worldwide web.

It will become much more important in the months ahead.<\/p> <p>The topic I wish to raise relates to an important ESRI report on the minimum wage that seemed to have been missed by the media last week.  The ESRI, the Government's own think-tank, reported last week that the 2016 increase in the minimum wage, an increase of 60 cent, which I believe is the biggest increase we have had, made no significant impact on household income, which is quite a telling statement.  We are talking about the poorest workers in the State.  The Government's think-tank has confirmed that an increase of 60 cent in the minimum wage made no difference in real terms to their living standards.  At the heart of this issue is the need to recognise that we need to move to a living wage, and I call for a debate on this matter.  Surely we should all be able to agree that those who work for a living deserve the right to earn a living.  The reality is that a person on the minimum wage does not have enough money to get through the week.<\/p> <p>There is also the added scandal of corporate welfare.  Many employers benefit from paying really poor wages and then having those wages topped up by the State through family income supplements that cost us hundreds of millions of euro each year.  Again, there would be largely a major saving for the State if we could move people to a living wage.  This is not some abstract thought.  These are actions that are happening in other countries and at local government level as well.  We need a debate about this.  If we can afford tax cuts, then surely to God we can afford to ensure that everyone earns a living wage in this country.  It is Sinn F&eacute;in policy to make that move within the first year of becoming part of a future Government, but surely it is a point on which we should all be able to agree.

It has brought politicians together for the past 29 to 30 years in a space in Westminster.

I was a guest at the Commonwealth service in Westminster Abbey on Monday, and I reiterate that 32 of the 53 member countries are republics.  It is a voluntary association of 53 independent sovereign states.  It is the Commonwealth of Nations, not the British Commonwealth.  Now more than ever we should get over our hang-ups and look at more associations.  India, Pakistan and Cyprus are independent states and we can also look to Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Seventy percent of the people born on the island of Ireland residing overseas reside in Commonwealth countries.  From legal, educational, sporting, cultural and political perspectives, we have major associations with them but we have a hang-up because we think of the Commonwealth as the British Commonwealth.  While \"God Save the Queen\" was being sung, I looked at the people seated across from me, many of whom were from those nations I mentioned, and they were not singing \"God Save the Queen\" because the Queen is not their monarch.

This is a sensitive time in North-South relations.  I believe it is the wrong time to be introducing this legislation, to be quite frank about it.  This legislation was before these Houses two years ago and the Minister did not have the support to proceed at that time.  The fact that he has not consulted at all in the intervening period with fishermen, either in the Republic or in the North, leaves a lot to be desired.  The fact that the Taoiseach raised public comments about this Bill last week and the Minister appears to be bringing it in here just before St. Patrick's Day means that it is rushed legislation.  That is wrong and there has been no consultation.  It would lead to the widespread exploitation of our natural resources within the six-mile limit.  That is something that needs to be discussed and managed very carefully and sensitively.  This Bill does neither of those things.  Consequently, this Bill should not come before this House until such time as proper consultation occurs with the fishing industry, particularly the inshore fishermen right along the coast.  This impacts fishermen, in particular in areas like Dundalk and Donegal, and they have not been consulted at all.  Their livelihoods are at stake.  We are talking about hundreds of jobs here that potentially could be wiped out as a result of the introduction of this Bill.  Any attempt to introduce this Bill tomorrow will be opposed from this side of the House during the Order of Business tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#E00200","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I wish to raise today the new rules for learner drivers that were brought in at the start of the year.

To expect to have a qualified driver sitting beside a young person 24 hours of the day, going to and coming from work, is absolutely ridiculous.  I have been speaking to employers, where young people are not able to get to work, and have basically given up their jobs.  In England, there is a system where there are learner driver centres.  One does a course for between 14 to 15 hours after which one is then given a permit that entitles a person to go on the road as a learner driver.  We should look at that system here in Ireland.  It would create employment.  If there was one such centre in every county in Ireland to facilitate young people, it would be a huge help and would create employment in the area.  The Minister has rushed this in and very little thought was put into it.  In principle, I suppose it is a good idea but I saw a young person driving alone this morning with L-plates on display, while unaccompanied by a qualified driver.

Ireland is spending more money than ever on healthcare but there is no correlation between accessibility to healthcare and the money spent.  Our waiting lists have reached record levels.  The Euro Health Consumer Index, EHCI, rates Ireland last when it comes to accessibility.  The Government plans to stabilise the waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient appointments.  Even reducing waiting times to a maximum of 18 months as planned, would still leave Ireland with the longest waiting lists in Europe.  The waiting list for outpatient appointments is currently standing at 542,000 people at the end of February.  The number of patients waiting for an inpatient procedure fell briefly at the end of 2018 to 70,000 people but has climbed back up to 71,200 people at the end of February.  The number of patients waiting for more than three months for a procedure has grown by 4,000 since the start of this year.  This is an astonishing rate of growth by anyone's standards.  More than 26,000 patients had been waiting for six months for planned procedures in January 2019 while approximately 2,300 had been waiting for more than 18 months.  More than 270,000 patients have been waiting for outpatient procedures for more than six months.  As the EHCI explains, healthcare is basically a process industry.  Smooth procedures with a minimum of pause and interruption are key to keeping the costs low.  We are spending more on healthcare than ever before because the system is broken.  Waiting lists do not save money; they cost money.  Notwithstanding the fact that much debate these days is about Brexit, I ask the Leader to consider facilitating an urgent debate on the whole waiting list issue to come before the House in the near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#E00400","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.

Like Senators Gavan and O'Reilly noted, the Council of Europe is becoming very important.  Senator Gavan raised the ESRI report and its importance.  It is an interesting report and I think it is also important that the increase in the minimum wage has succeeded in reducing wage inequality.  Perhaps the minimum wage might not be the effective tool in reducing the level of poverty.  That is a conversation and debate we should have.  A point that he did not make is that the increase in the minimum wage has led to a &euro;30 per week benefit, which is a significant amount of money for those who have seen the increase.

That applies to industry and other sectors, in particular, the one that is most likely to be impacted on more than any other in the North and the South - agriculture.  Any reciprocal arrangement in that sector between this state and Northern Ireland stems from the Good Friday Agreement and EU law.  The UK Government has always indicated that it will try and will honour its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  We expect it to do so, irrespective of whether there is a deal, and the arrangements under the agreement to continue post Brexit.  However, if we consider the arrangements facilitated by EU law, in as much as possible and to the greatest extent possible, they will continue post Brexit.  In the event that Northern Ireland changes its law post Brexit, it might not be necessary or possible to continue the existing arrangements, particularly if the new arrangements contravene EU law.  In that instance, neither the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade nor any other Minister would be able to introduce orders that would contravene EU law or breach our obligations.<br\/><br\/>In the circumstances the proposed amendments should be withdrawn on the basis that accepting them could serve to confuse or mislead people outside the House and make them believe the Government would be able to act outside EU law.

This is a straightforward amendment.  Regardless of the sort of Brexit that happens - we are coming close to the end - services and arrangements will continue to be delivered in the aftermath of Brexit.  This Bill will give the Ministers for Health and Finance the power to continue with whatever services they choose.  We hope that means all cross-Border services will be continued, but the nature of this legislation means such decisions will be in the hands of the Ministers and indeed the hands of the Ministers of State, Deputies Jim Daly and Helen McEntee.  Britain has to offer reciprocal arrangements for people in England, Scotland and Wales.  We do not yet know whether that will be delivered on.  The continued smooth operation of cross-Border health services must be an integral part of our approach to this matter.  It is important that we have proper evidence and facts on which to base our assessment of the delivery of services.  If we do not know what is happening and how effective it is, how can we decide to continue doing what we are doing or to make changes as necessary?  With that in mind, I am seeking \"a review into the effectiveness of the health services covered under [this legislation] one year after the United Kingdom has left the European Union\".  This would benefit policymakers, health services and medical and healthcare professionals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#L00700","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The arrangements provided for in this Bill are contingency steps that are being taken to minimise any disruption to the current healthcare arrangements between Ireland and the UK.

It is unclear how \"the effectiveness of the health services\" could be determined.  With regard to the review that has been proposed, I can confirm that the Minister would be willing to attend a meeting of the health committee, or to arrange for the relevant officials to attend such a meeting, to report as necessary on the progress being made on the matters referred to by the Senator.

Amendment No. 12 would impose an obligation on the Minister to \"report to the Oireachtas within one month of the passing of this Act on .... existing Service Level Agreements, Memorandums of Understanding, and partnerships; provisions made to ensure that all Irish citizens have access to a European Health Insurance Card and the benefits which that entails; provisions made to ensure the recognition of professional qualifications in respect of medical professionals and healthcare workers from the United Kingdom where education and training standards are equivalent\".  The Bill does not contain provisions relating to future recognition of health professional qualifications.  However, given its critical importance to the health sector, a number of measures are being advanced to address this.  In particular, the UK recently published its draft European qualifications.  This UK legislation will enable Irish qualifications to be recognised in the UK.  Each of the Irish health professional regulators has third-country recognition routes which apply to qualifications obtained in countries other than Ireland or any other EEA member state.  These third-country recognition routes have been considered with the objective of ensuring efficient routes for the recognition of UK qualifications, while ensuring this is done in an objective and non-discriminatory way.  The Irish regulators are satisfied that they can continue to recognise UK qualifications within approximately the same timeframes and with approximately the same applications fees, but under a different legal base.  A separate Bill - the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2019, which is included in the Brexit legislative programme - will provide for the use by the Irish regulators of disciplinary information received from third countries, including the UK and EEA member states.<\/p> <p>With regard to the maintenance of service level agreements, the Irish and UK Governments are fully committed to continuing existing cross-Border service arrangements.  Cross-Border health services such as the cardiology and cancer treatments in Derry and the paediatric cardiology and associated maternity services in Dublin are managed by service level agreements and do not require legislative changes in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Even in a scenario in which the UK leaves the EU without a deal, services like these can be expected to continue.  It is important to note that these services are aimed at addressing the particular needs of groups of patients in facilitating geographical access to services and achieving sufficient volumes of activity in the interests of patient safety.  The Government is aware and conscious of the concerns of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland who are likely to lose their entitlement to the European health insurance card, EHIC, after the UK withdraws form the EU.  Under the relevant EU regulations, an individual applies for an EHIC in his or her competent member state.  The competent member state must state where that person works, makes a social insurance contribution or receives a contributory pension.  We are exploring whether it may be possible to establish a route by which the EHIC benefit could be maintained for people living in Northern Ireland.  However, this is not necessarily a straightforward matter.  The regulation that gives eligibility for an EHIC is an EU regulation.  An alternative legal mechanism to enable people living in Northern Ireland to have an EHIC would need to be developed.  I expect that it would likely to need the agreement of other member states.  The other amendments in this group - Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive - are technical amendments, which would be needed to take account of the renumbering required on foot of amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  For the reasons I have outlined, and taking account of the urgent emergency nature of this legislation and the extremely limited timeframe for its enactment, I must decline to accept the amendments in this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#L01000","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I would like to speak to amendment No. 12 now.

We have worked hard over the year to set these agreements, memorandums and partnerships in motion to avoid duplication of services on this small island.  Amendment No. 12 refers to the \"European Health Insurance Card\" and the \"recognition of professional qualifications\", both of which are important.  I suppose I am speaking for nursing staff who find it difficult to know where they will be in this scenario.  The NHS was set up and underpinned by hundreds of thousands of Irish nurses.  We are trying to attract Irish nurses and indigenous English-trained nurses to come to Ireland.  The \"Bring them Home\" campaign did not prove to be attractive.  The barriers that will go up because of the red tape associated with Brexit will make it much less attractive to try to get nurses back to their country of origin.  This amendment refers to the EHIC, which is known as the E11 card.  Irish citizens in the North and in Britain are concerned about this issue.  The Taoiseach and others have said that Irish citizens in the North will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.  In the interests of such citizens, I ask that the situation with regard to the E11 card be assessed in the aftermath of Brexit.  We need to know what impact Brexit will have on services in its aftermath.  I hope the Minister of State will give a commitment to completing a review.  I will not push amendments Nos. 11 or 12.

It means arguing for the globalisation fund to be recalibrated to fight off the shock of Brexit in industries such as the mushroom sector before and not just after those industries are hit.  The fiscal rules and their inbuilt austerity logic must be challenged now more than ever.  The EU cannot say it will protect Ireland in its words and then tell us that we cannot protect ourselves through these rules.  There are other areas such as Structural Funds where we need to make a case for more flexibility, for example, greater co-financing.  We should be saying that we need to be pushed to the front of the queue for the EU transport and infrastructure projects.  That is what fighting for Ireland would look like.  The issue of the green card for motor insurance is probably the most visible and worrying aspect of what life might look like for those living near the Border in a no-deal Brexit situation.  Under Article 8(2) of the EU motor insurance directive, the EU can give a waiver to Britain and the North to ensure there is no need for insurance green cards.  It did that for other countries, including Serbia in 2011.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Ross, should have been pushing this at EU level.  Instead, he washed his hands of it and no arrangement is in place.  My colleague, Deputy Munster, was blue in the face questioning him at the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and on the floor of the D&aacute;il and he had very little information on it.  He could not tell what interventions he had made with the EU and Britain to ensure that there was an agreement in place ahead of Brexit.  This should have been done and dusted by now if he had bothered to do his job.  He simply does not understand the sensitivities of the issue for people on the Border, including people going to work every day, farmers accessing their own land, families visiting one another and tourists.  Many people will not accept that they will have to carry a green card for these purposes.  Others are completely confused as to the situation.  On an issue as important as this, the Minister, Deputy Ross, saw fit to abuse and insult a colleague of mine in the other House.  That was unacceptable.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, needs to do his job.  If he still refuses to do so, then this amendment, if agreed to, mandates the Government to ensure that the necessary work is done.

It is up to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to accept our amendment or else explain to the hundreds of thousands of people who will be affected by this why he allowed a Cabinet colleague to sit on his hands and allow a mess like this to happen.

That is not a bad thing and not a point of disagreement, just one of fact.  Subsection (2) of amendment No. 15 refers to \"examining why there has been such a low uptake of these Brexit business supports\".  That is a little unfair and plays down the remarkable work that has been done by State agencies as opposed to the Government, especially Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Tourism Ireland and many others, particularly those that have reported the substantial take-up and engagement, especially since December, as we have lurched ever closer to Brexit day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Neale Richmond:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To glibly include that undoes the remarkable work that is being done by our civil servants and State agencies, including the IDA, which I should have mentioned.

God forbid but if we enter into a crash-out scenario, it will not help to have such a strict timeline for those discussions.  They are not easy discussions.  In most of the reports on Brexit that Sinn F&eacute;in has published heretofore, there have been a couple of very consistent trends.  While I commend their consistency, I disagree with them.  I refer first and foremost to flexibility on state aid, the call for a Border poll, which is not being discussed in this section, and many others.  When we look at EU state aid and financial flexibility within the European Union, timing is everything.  Calling for this from the outset, 18 months ago, undermines whatever potential discussions may lay ahead.  I refer to potential discussions because I still very much hope that we never have to have them.

In the context of discussing business preparedness, I pay tribute to my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, who has spearheaded preparedness in this area and with her information sessions all over the country to make people Brexit-ready.  They have been attended by some 2,500 people.  I was at one of them and it was very informative and did a very good job.  Enterprise Ireland is to be commended on its input, as are the local enterprise offices.  There was particular awareness on the part of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, which was reflected in the organised events, of how precarious things were on the Border and in the Border region, of the degree to which everything was particularly difficult there and that there was a particular need for support.  All of this was supported by a large injection of at least &euro;78 million in budget 2019.  There has been a real effort across Departments and a very specific effort in the business sphere.

They are on the radio quite frequently and they do attract attention.  However, I understand that the uptake, particularly in small and medium enterprises, is quite slow.  I think that is worrying.  Maybe it is because people feel there might be expense involved and they cannot cope with this.

Part of this extensive review is an examination of the provision of supports for indigenous businesses and how they are assisted by Departments and Government agencies.  The report will examine the strategic framework and delivery system for SME and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  It will be published in the third quarter of this year and we will await its findings and recommendations with interest.<\/p> <p>The Brexit loan scheme was launched in 2018 and I am pleased to say there has been a steady stream of applications so far.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, received 462 applications under the scheme up until 22 February, of which 413 have been deemed eligible for a loan under the scheme.  Of those, 81 have been progressed to sanction at finance provider level, to a total value of over &euro;17 million.  It is important to remember that this is not a loan scheme for businesses to carry on as usual.  We are asking businesses to carefully consider what they need to do to successfully address their Brexit challenge through innovating, changing or adapting their business model in some capacity.  These responses may include strengthening their product offering, developing new markets to diversify their trade footprint, changing their organisational structure or developing new capabilities.  There are some very good examples of companies that are doing that with the support of Enterprise Ireland.  Carbery Group is probably the best example of that.  A number of weeks ago, a very significant grant was given to it to help it diversify away from an over-reliance on the British market as regards cheese.<\/p> <p>Work continues on the longer-term future growth loan scheme, which will help eligible businesses invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The scheme was announced as part of the budget 2019 package and is expected to be launched early this year.  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland provided approval for funding of &euro;74 million to 535 Brexit-exposed companies across a range of Brexit financial supports.  In addition, there were interventions with more than 1,000 companies that have significant exports to the UK.  In excess of 1,000 companies have attended Brexit advisory clinics throughout the country, 4,400 companies have completed the Brexit SME score card, while almost 1,000 have completed the Enterprise Ireland online customs insights programme since December.  Visits to the Prepare for Brexit website, which contains information on a range of Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise office, LEO, and other agency supports, have increased tenfold over the past 12 weeks.  We have reached 90% of the SME audience with our Brexit support communications.  As one would expect, as Brexit gets closer, there has been a dramatic increase in the engagement and interest from businesses.  As they realise that this is actually happening, they are reaching out for the necessary supports and advice.  Of course, we do not know how Brexit is going to happen, but we are doing everything we can to ensure that we do not face the challenges of a no-deal Brexit and instead have a managed, predictable Brexit that moves us into a transition period for the next two to four years and allows time and space for adaptation to the new reality.<\/p><p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also allocated an additional &euro;8 million for Brexit staffing and supports across enterprise and regulatory agencies, including the roll-out of new customs training through the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland, an Enterprise Ireland guide to best practice on managing currency volatility, and an addition &euro;1 million for InterTradeIreland which has used that money very well, particularly for cross-Border companies.<\/p><p>I do not propose to support the amendment because I am not sure it is good legislative practice to include a requirement for a review mechanism when a review is under way.  Of course, this House or the D&aacute;il can bring in the Minister at any given time and demand accountability, information on uptake and so on.  What is being provided for in this amendment is already happening.  Accountability to this House and to the D&aacute;il will be very clear.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 28, reporting on engagement with the EU is a separate matter not related to this very focused and streamlined legislation which is about putting the necessary arrangements in place for maintaining continuity for citizens and businesses in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  However, I assure Senators that the Government will continue to make the case for support in a most robust manner at EU level and that Ministers will be regularly updating the Oireachtas on their Department's engagement at EU level in their areas of responsibility.  Today, as we speak, a team from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is meeting its counterparts in the European Commission.  They are trying to scope out and plan the appropriate response for a no-deal Brexit scenario.  This work is already happening in a very serious way and has been for many weeks now.  Of course, Ministers like me have to come into this House and be constantly questioned and tested on our responses but we do not need to add to this legislation a requirement for a reporting mechanism a month after Britain leaves the EU.  We will be going way beyond that in terms of accountability for the decisions and actions we are taking and for the funding that may be required to back them up.  Supporting vulnerable sectors like agrifood and farming in the context of a no-deal Brexit that may involve tariffs will require a very significant amount of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#N01100","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply but I am a little concerned because he said that an OECD report was commissioned last March, which is a year ago.

The single electricity market, under the amended Electricity Regulation Act 1999, has demonstrated the direct benefits of an all-island economy., which is why it must be maintained post Brexit if we are to continue to benefit householders, businesses and the environment, North and South.  I thank Deputy Stanley and, in particular, Martina Anderson MEP, who have done much work on the matter.  As we are aware, Martina Anderson, who has been an MEP since 2012, will more than likely no longer be because, unfortunately, the two seats in the North will be retained in the so-called Twenty-six Counties, that is, the South, even though legal advice has shown that it would be possible and better if they were to remain in the Six Counties to allow the people of those areas be represented, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.<\/p><p>The amendment seeks to amend the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The all-island body, which has representatives from the regulator in Belfast and the regulator in Dublin, oversees the functioning of an all-island electricity market, which has been in place for more than a decade.  The amendment will provide that, in the event of a hard Brexit, the single electricity market committee, whose members are appointed by the Minister, will address new regulatory circumstances, and that the committee will attempt to ensure regulatory alignment on the island.  The new market rules for the single electricity market were launched last year and it has been reported that they could cut energy bills for businesses and householders by up to &euro;200 million per year.  The amendment is important in ensuring that we will retain the single electricity market and all the benefits it has brought to the people north, south, east and west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#Q00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>There is a problem with the amendment insofar as it seeks to impose regulations on the North of Ireland, which is outside of our jurisdiction, but I will be advised by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#Q00400","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The single electricity market is important and the electricity interconnector plays a vital role in feeding electricity back and forth across the Border and keeping industry going.

There is no doubt that the single electricity market is an important asset, North and South, which allows us to share generation, reducing the need for expensive standby generation in each jurisdiction.  It is the only fully integrated single electricity market in the European Union, which to some degree is why we do not need to do anything as there is legislation North and South that establishes it.  The regulators have all the powers they need to ensure regulatory alignment and they sit jointly and maintain the fully fledged operation of the market.  The sufficient powers are provided for in Part II of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, in case Senators wish to examine it.  The single electricity market is overseen by a committee comprising the regulator in the South and the regulator in the North, which jointly oversee the operation of the market, and it will not be disturbed by the British decision to exit the European Union.  It is based on legislation North and South and will not be influenced in any way.  It operates as a single market and, therefore, there is no question of cross-Border trading between North and South, although there are no tariffs on electricity in any event.  It is a single market and operates as such.<\/p> <p>Apart from it not being necessary to provide these powers because the regulators already have them, it would not be in accordance with the independence of regulators if the Oireachtas sought to impose an obligation upon them to report to a Minister.  It is an important principle of regulators, overseen by European law, that they are independent of Ministers.  The idea that they would be required to report to a Minister would be seen as encroaching on their independence.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, reports to the Oireachtas through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  If Senators, therefore, at any point wish to cross-examine the CRU on the operation of the single electricity market, it is open to them to call the regulator to the committee, which it will be only too happy to attend.  Independence of the regulator from the Minister is an important principle of regulation.<\/p> <p>The final reason I do not believe the amendment is appropriate is the one raised by Senator Reilly.  The single electricity market was developed under legislation enacted jointly North and South, and its committee has legislation North and South underpinning it.  It would not be appropriate for the Oireachtas to seek to bind a committee that has separate legislative underpinning in the North.  We have always approached the market by attempting to develop it jointly, but the amendment would be a departure from that important and established approach.  I am happy to assure the House that there will be no disruption to the operation of the single electricity market North and South due to the British decision.  While there may be disruptions to the market from east to west, that is, on the electricity interconnector, because much of the trade on the interconnector is based on a European platform, there is no fear of any immediate disruption because intra-day trading and security trading can continue.  In the longer term, however, if Britain exits, we will have to establish a new basis for the east-west trade.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This can be done in the longer term and we are satisfied that, in the short term, trade can continue on the Ireland-UK interconnector without disruption by the British decision.

Rather than walk into another minefield where leads to a crisis in the response to students, it would be prudent, moderate and just good common sense to set up a specific section to deal with it.  I hope the Minister will not be a captive of his Department on the issue and will work with us to support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#R00800","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>As a former academic, I am interested in the amendment.

It is not an issue and I know that Senator Gavan is not suggesting that there is an issue but while we are here it is worth acknowledging the wonderful work of SUSI.  The agency is extraordinarily responsive to my office and to constituency queries.  I can tell the Minister that I find SUSI to be performing at a very high level.  We hope it continues.<\/p><p>I put it to Senator Gavan that fundamentally the apparatus is already in place.  SUSI is already in place and working at full capacity.  It is considerably resourced.  It deals with this kind of scenario on a day-to-day basis with students from Northern Ireland and the UK and it does so very effectively.  It is my contention that processes are already there, and I assume the Minister, Deputy McHugh - who will speak for himself quite adequately - will be happy to say that were things to change and were more resources needed, they would be forthcoming.  While the objective of the amendment might be good, it has already been achieved and there is no need for a particular amendment to say what is already in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#R01000","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Ar dt&uacute;s, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; uilig f&aacute; choinne an tseans labhairt leo inniu agus f&aacute; choinne an chomhr&aacute;, at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th, faoi thoradh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta Brexit a bh&iacute; ann inn&eacute; agus faoin mh&eacute;id a tharl&oacute;idh amach anseo.  Aithn&iacute;m go mbeidh tiomantas i gceist go f&oacute;ill.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for the time they have given to this important Bill.  I will give Senators some context on the organisational aspects of SUSI.  The Senators have been specific in referring to SUSI with regard to the amendment and, as I said in the D&aacute;il, I take the spirit of the amendment very seriously.  I want to ensure that while we are still not sure as to what the Brexit outcome will be, there will be equality of access for people, be they living in Bangor, Ballaghaderreen or Bandon.  I am aware that all Senators are very conscious of this.<\/p><p>The City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, was designated as an awarding authority for student grants by way of a ministerial order in May 2012.  As such, SUSI is not a corporate entity and it would, therefore, be inappropriate to include a provision in primary legislation that refers to a business unit as opposed to a corporate entity.  There is a management framework agreement in place between my Department and the CDETB that defines and forms prescribed rules for the administration of student grants.  This agreement also defines the governance structures and functioning mechanisms with a view to ensuring the<font color=\"#FF4040\"> <\/font>development, delivery and effective administration of student grants.  The service levels agreed are intended to act as a key performance metric as to how the City of Dublin ETB provides these services.  These indicators include system availability, functionality and development, communications, the payment process, the appeals process and, more importantly, customer service.  In addition, SUSI's staffing model provides a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the recruitment of temporary staff to meet peak demands during the grant processing season.  Should the need arise it will be open to SUSI management to reallocate resources to meet its operational needs.  This answer's Senator O'Reilly's point about resources.  That certainly would not be a question as far as I am concerned.  If people want access on a timely basis it should be required, irrespective of being in this or other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>There is already a provision within the Student Support Act 2011 to outsource certain functions by SUSI.In this regard the CDETB has engaged the services of an outsourced provider called Abtran.  This company provides a call centre and document management service for SUSI.  Should the need arise it is possible to increase the resources provided by this company to meet any potential peak in demand.<\/p><p>It is estimated that SUSI processes some 100,000 applications for SUSI grants and less than 2% of these are from outside the Republic of Ireland.  It is also noticeable that as all applicants become more familiar with the SUSI processes it has led to greater efficiencies in its service delivery.  This is a tribute not only to greater clarity and communications from SUSI, but also to the valuable role played by careers guidance counsellors in our schools and to the people in this House and the D&aacute;il in 2012 during the time of when the ETB got this service level agreement contract.  There were a lot of teething problems and complications but the fact that SUSI is not raised on the floor of the House or in parliamentary questions is testament to the great work it has been doing.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the objective of the amendment is to ensure there are resources in place to deliver a very clear message for all applicants for SUSI supports, and specifically to those seeking to study in the UK, those UK citizens looking to study in Ireland, or students from the North.  I agree fully with this.  I am particularly conscious that any changes in the area of student finance can bring uncertainty.  Clearly, I want to avoid that.  My Department will continue to consult with SUSI to ensure that adequate resources are in place to deal effectively with the level of queries that may arise.  As I said earlier, the option remains to adjust resources if that is required.<\/p><p>The Government is very committed to clear and precise communications on all aspects of Brexit impacts.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recently updated its content on Brexit and more specifically the common travel area.  In addition to using its own social media and communications my Department will be updating material on this site on specific education issues as they arise.<\/p><p>In seeking to assure all Senators I want to communicate very clearly that Irish students will continue to be eligible for SUSI supports while they study in the UK and in the North, and that the Northern Ireland and UK students will continue to be eligible for the SUSI grants while they study in higher education institutions in Ireland.<\/p><p>Since my appointment as Minister my goal has been to protect the valuable and rich co-operation that takes place between education institutions on a North-South and an east-west basis.  There are examples of this co-operation at all levels.  The north-west strategic partnership, for example, is the Letterkenny Institute of Technology and Donegal ETB working closely with the University of Ulster and the North West Regional College from the North to ensure further and higher education provision are closely aligned with the skills and industrial needs of the region. <\/p><p>In many senses the Border does not figure as these education institutions seek to develop a shared education and skills strategy.  On a personal footnote with regard to the Border, on Monday I crossed the Border eight times in one day.  It is a very fluid border and if one was to ask me if I knew I was crossing it on those eight times I would not.  It was not just because my head was in the phone - while I was in the passenger seat - but it is because we know how fluid the Border is, and we want to keep it that way.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge the commitment of all the educators at all levels who have built collaborations across the Border.  They deserve commendation and our appreciation.  The foundations they built must be protected and strengthened.  There has been a shared education ecosystem between Ireland and the United Kingdom since the foundation of the State, and even before that.  It is very important that we protect and preserve that collaboration into the future in the interests of our young people and the next generation.<\/p><p>The common travel area will mitigate many of the Brexit impacts within the education sector.  This includes the SUSI grants and maintaining the current EU fees system for Northern Irish and UK students.  Agreement on these principles between my Department and the Department for Education in the UK, as well as on wider policy issues on other levels of education, has been reached and discussions are now focused on framing these within the memorandum of understanding.  This will protect much of the valuable and rich co-operation that takes place in education on a North-South and an east-west basis. <\/p><p>The Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and I both view Part 5 of the Bill - which is the focus of today's engagement - as one of the key responses from my Department to the challenges of Brexit.  It will facilitate the student mobility between the South, the North and the wider UK, and it will enable me to meet education obligations under the common travel area.<\/p><p>I am confident that SUSI will be able to adjust its capacity to deal with possible increases in calls and demands for information.  I acknowledge the motivation and concern of Sinn F&eacute;in in this regard, but unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment as outlined.  I note that amendment No. 36 seeks that a review is undertaken not later than 12 months after the commencement of Part 5 of the Bill.  I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, intends to address this more comprehensively later on.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I assure the Seanad that I am committed to working with the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to ensure the impact of the Part 5 is communicated in an open and objective manner.  Many have spoken of this Bill as one which everyone hopes will not be enacted.  Hopefully, that will be the case.  As a public representative from Donegal, I am very conscious of the impact of a disorderly Brexit on citizens North and South.  A no-deal outcome is in nobody's interest.  It is now for the UK to set out what it intends to do next.  Let us hope that clarity comes shortly and that we can remove the political uncertainty for both North-South and east-west.<\/p><p>I acknowledge Senator Norris's contribution on the decline in the movement of students from the North over the years.  That is something of which I am very conscious.  There are factors which have led to that situation but that is not an excuse in itself not to do something about it.  He was correct in saying that there are communications and timeframe issues in terms of applications.  That is something of which we can take control, but I am certainly of the belief that we should plough ahead with that continued engagement on a North-South basis.  I thank the Senator for raising that issue.

One part relates to VAT.  I am particularly interested in VAT for SMEs.  At the moment if a company registered for VAT in Ireland acquires a service or goods from the UK, no VAT is charged coming or going.  My understanding from the proposed legislation - I am glad Senator Norris raised this - is that now there is a VAT liability on companies in Ireland that acquire services or goods from VAT-rateable companies in the UK, which adds a significant tax burden for them.  Is the Minister of State in a position to clarify that?<\/p> <p>The second issue relates to Part 10, section 72, and the Road Transport Act.  We all have difficulty with the intricacies of the legislation and its technical aspect.  It would take weeks to get through it and understand it because it refers back to sections and subsections of various other Acts, making it very difficult for us in a short timeframe.  Having said that, I have nothing but praise from the Minister of State, his Government colleagues and the civil servants who spent ages working on getting this legislation to its present state.  It is a significant compliment to the Minister of State and his Government colleagues.<\/p> <p>My first question was on VAT.  Part 10, section 72 deals with the Road Transport Act 1978.  We have a big issue here and this legislation could make it worse.  A private bus company is outside the VAT net and cannot claim back VAT on parts, spares, maintenance, etc.  However, a UK company, including one based in Northern Ireland, can claim back VAT on various expenses.  If the bus company is - I am subject to correction on this terminology - wholly and exclusively for the purpose of tourism, it can claim back the VAT.  We need to try to ensure that in a worst-case scenario small bus companies and other small businesses that are importing from the UK are not more disadvantaged than at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#U00900","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I will respond to both.

These are what we know we have to do in the case of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked about VAT and importers and exporters.  Again we discussed this with Revenue.  In a no-deal Brexit, VAT would be automatically chargeable.  We have tried to continue the same structure, trying to be as helpful as we can be so that the current structures still arise and people can pay the VAT for the period, which is normally quarterly for businesses, so that it will not impact on cashflow.<\/p> <p>The Senator's other point about VAT on transport is not a Brexit issue.

As part of that consideration, the court will consider human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It has jurisdiction to release a person sought for extradition if it believes he or she would not face a fair trial or his or her human or fundamental rights would not be respected if extradited.  Ultimately, it is the Irish courts which are the most effective protector of human and fundamental rights, as has been proved on numerous occasions when requests for extradition orders have been refused.  In the event that a country decides to leave the convention, that development would have to be taken into account by the court in considering an extradition request from that country.

I did not fully hear the question to the other Minister, but I will ensure the Senator receives a briefing note on it.  <\/p><p>The Bill is linked with a memorandum of understanding we have with the United Kingdom in protecting the common travel area.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has signed an agreement with her UK counterpart to guarantee the continuation of 21 social welfare payments to Irish people living in the United Kingdom, whether in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  It will ensure people can continue to receive their pension, child benefit and many other welfare support payments, on which they rely for their weekly income.  Likewise, tens of thousands of British people living in Ireland receive pension and other financial support payments from the United Kingdom in Ireland.  The continuing and seamless facilitation of these payments through a Brexit process requires a bilateral agreement.  The same applies to students.  We have to provide for the facilitation of our students in the United Kingdom.  The legislation will allow us to continue to give them grant aid to study there.  If the United Kingdom does not consider them to be in the category of the common travel area, they will become foreign students paying foreign student fees and so on.<\/p><p>This legislation is about a bilateral agreement provided for in law or a memorandum of understanding since the 1920s, long before the European Union or the EEC were even thought of, following Irish Independence when Britain and Ireland recognised each other's citizens in each other's country and facilitated free movement of students and workers.  Joining the European Union and sharing the Single Market and the customs union reinforced it.  However, we did not have to have a legal basis for a lot of it as it was catered for under EU rules.  Now that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, we have to have a legal basis for some of this stuff.  That is what a lot of this legislation is about.  I hope that puts in context what we are trying to do.  There are some things for which we cannot prepare with legislation in no-deal or contingency planning because it an EU competence.  However, there are many areas in which we can legislate to put a legal basis in place to protect the <i>status quo<\/i>.  That is why seven Ministers are dealing with this legislation across multiple areas.

I seek reassurance from the T&aacute;naiste as to the status of such family members, such as persons who are in partnership with or married to British citizens resident in Ireland but who are from outside the EEA.  An individual raised that specific question with me and I indicated on Second Stage that I would raise it on Committee Stage.  People seek a reassurance about the impact that a no-deal Brexit will have on their status and that of those closest to them after 29 March.

I will not support amendments Nos. 23 to 25, inclusive, but I will explain why.<\/p><p>The provisions in sections 95 and 96 are inserted for the purpose of correcting a legislative lacuna in the legal basis for non-<i>refoulement<\/i>considerations.  Non-<i>refoulement<\/i>is the practice of not returning a non-national to a country in which he or she is liable to be subjected to persecution or where the life or freedom of the person would be put at risk.  Under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, this applied not only to persons subject to that Act but also to persons removed from the State under the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Immigration Act 2003, that is, it applies regardless of whether the person is a refugee or asylum seeker.<\/p><p>The introduction of the International Protection Act 2015, which repealed the Act of 1996, inadvertently removed the legal basis providing for non-<i>refoulement<\/i>within the Acts of 1999 and 2003.  In S.G. (Albania) <i>v. <\/i>the Minister for Justice and Equality, the High Court identified administrative issues with the enactment of the International Protection Bill 2015, the transitional provisions relating to the Refugee Act 1996 and the domestic legal basis for the consideration by the Minister of the principle against <i>refoulement<\/i>.  The court identified that the Minister's reference to the legal basis for the prohibition of <i>refoulement<\/i>was incorrect and that these issues had existed since 31 December 2016.  The significance of that date is that it was the date on which the inadvertent lacuna arose when the International Protection Act 2015 was commenced and as a consequence, the Refugee Act 1996, including the <i>refoulement<\/i>provision of section 5 of the Act of 1996, was repealed.  Its legal base was inadvertently removed and, therefore, was no longer in law.<\/p><p>Regardless of these administrative issues, it has remained the policy and practice of the Minister for Justice and Equality to apply non-<i>refoulement<\/i>principles to all removals from the State, in conformity with our constitutional and international obligations.  The Minister is nonetheless satisfied that legal certainty is required in the area, that the lacuna needs to be corrected as a priority, and that we should use this legislation to do so, the reason for which I will explain.  The purpose of sections 95 and 96 is to restore the position whereby there is a legal base to the non-<i>refoulement <\/i>consideration for all persons being removed from the State, not just in the protection area but including all deportations and persons refused permission to enter the State.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the proposed amendments.  Amendment No. 24 is not consistent with the definition of non-<i>refoulement<\/i>applied under section 50 of the International Protection Act 2015, which states:<\/p><blockquote>(1) A person shall not be expelled or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontier of a territory where, in the opinion of the Minister&mdash;(a) the life or freedom of the person would be threatened for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or<br \/><br \/>(b) there is a serious risk that the person would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.<\/blockquote> <p>The definition is based on principles of international law and encompasses serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence, female genital mutilation and the best interests of the child, which are fully considered in this context.  On the basis of advice that the Minister for Justice and Equality has received from the Office of the Attorney General, it is not necessary expressly to include forms of sexual and gender-based violence or female genital mutilation, which are covered by inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.  As for the proposal to include &quot;flagrant denial of a fair trial&quot; within the definition, this comes within the scope of <i>refoulement<\/i>, as held by the European Court of Human Rights in Othman (Abu Qatada) <i>v<\/i>. United Kingdom.  As Ireland is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, it accepts that the flagrant denial of a fair trial falls under the definition of inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.  It is not an appropriate test to include in the legislation.<\/p><p>The definition in the Bill is in line with that used in other countries and, accordingly, there is a risk in seeking to create a new definition at a time consistency is essential, particularly for the individual who may be at risk.  The prohibition of <i>refoulement<\/i>under international human rights law applies to any form of removal or transfer of persons, regardless of their status.  As an inherent element of the prohibition of torture and other forms of ill treatment, the principle of non-<i>refoulement<\/i>is characterised by its absolute nature, without any exception.  It is not a judgment call in which one can apply an increased level of concern towards children.  Rather, it is a black and white issue; it either applies or it does not.  There is no need, therefore, to make exceptions for certain categories of person, whether it is a child, adult or somebody who may be a victim of persecution, have a certain sexual preference or whatever.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The prohibition applies to all persons irrespective of their citizenship, nationality, statelessness, age, gender or migration status and it applies wherever a State exercises jurisdiction or effective control.  For the reasons I have set out, I am not in a position to accept the amendments, mainly because I believe they would weaken the provisions.  Obviously, that is not the Senator's intention.  I understand what he is seeking to achieve, which is to focus the spotlight on the vulnerability of children or other areas but that is catered for in a pretty clear way in the note I outlined to him.

At a briefing in the audiovisual room last week, a representative of Border Communities Against Brexit spoke about the immediate impact that a green card would have, including the differential that would result if reciprocal arrangements were not put in place in respect of issues like insurance.  The T&aacute;naiste touched on this the last time he appeared before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The representative of Border Communities Against Brexit spoke about the immediate impact that a green card would have on a range of businesses, not least the haulage business.  He referred to a haulier with a fleet of 80 lorries, all of which will need an individual green card at a cost of between &euro;25 and &euro;50 per card.  He said that his colleagues in the haulage business are angry that this situation has come about.  He asked what would happen to his business if he refused to purchase the necessary paperwork, or to comply with filling it in.  He wondered whether his goods would be impounded in such circumstances.  This creates a significant degree of uncertainty for him and his business.  During a meeting with representatives of O'Neill's Sportswear in Belfast earlier this week, I was informed that when one of the company's lorries is bringing gear to Dublin from its plant in Strabane, it has to cross the Border 18 times before it reaches Dublin.  That is the reality of the madness we are facing.  I know the T&aacute;naiste is all too well aware of it.  Amendment No. 29 is concise and clear in what it tries to do.  Rather than prolonging the agony for Members, I will let the amendment speak for itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#EE00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I have a long written note here, but I do not need to read it all.  We have discussed these issues.  As a country, we would like to be able to do something on this unilaterally, but we cannot do so.  This is an EU competence, which is covered by an EU directive.  If there is to be some accommodation here to prevent the need for proof of international motor insurance, which can be provided for by having a green card on the dashboard and which is simply proof of valid insurance outside the jurisdiction of the EU, that can only be solved by the EU facilitating the UK on that, which it could do in the context of contingency planning.  We have spoken to the UK about that.  That will continue to be an active conversation if we continue to move towards a no-deal Brexit.  We hope it will not become a likelihood rather than a possibility.  I hope we will move away from that likelihood tonight.  The Senator is asking me to do something that legally cannot be done.  We cannot introduce this kind of law here because we do not have the legal competence to overrule a European directive.<\/p><p>I understand the issue.  I understand the annoyance among drivers who cross the Border on a daily basis, or even just once a year.  I can understand why it grates on people that it has been called a green card, of all names.  The insurance industry had to act.  It had to do something to put contingency in place for itself and its clients and customers to ensure people could continue to drive back and forth.  There is a mechanism which allows for that in the context of this green card system.  It is a fallback position.  It is a contingency.  It is not something we wanted in place.  It is certainly much better than not being able to drive into Northern Ireland and not being able to provide proof of insurance on an international basis.<\/p><p>I give the House a commitment that we will continue to talk to the European Commission about trying to resolve this issue in the context of contingency planning.  If we move towards a no-deal as a likelihood, there will need to be a great deal of interaction between the Irish and British Governments and the Commission.  The three groups in the room will need to look at how an all-island economy will function.  The idea that the UK can unilaterally do something along the lines of what it published this morning, and that Ireland and the EU will unilaterally do something else, is not conducive to a functioning system of trade and movement on the island of Ireland.  From my perspective, if a no-deal moves over the next 48 hours from a possibility to a strong likelihood, we will be in a different space and we will have to try to negotiate a lot of contingency work.  This is one of many issues that would be part of such a discussion.  We will continue to raise it.  In the meantime, the industry is right to make progress with this as a solution.  As I have said, it is not something that people want.  I can understand why it frustrates and annoys people.  This is a less than perfect contingency.  That is the way people should see it.<\/p><p>I cannot accommodate the amendment that the Senator is advocating for.

I could have mentioned the people from Belfast who will want to take their kids to Dublin Zoo over the Easter break.

This amendment asks that the Minister for Finance would report back to the Oireachtas within one month of the passing of this legislation on the establishment of a Brexit stabilisation fund.  This is about reporting on something that was not previously required.  The Senator's colleague, Deputy Cullinane, raised the issue of a stabilisation fund in the D&aacute;il today.  I told him that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, at the start of this week outlined in quite a degree of detail the financial consequences for the State of a no-deal Brexit in terms of the impact that would have on the Exchequer, the responsibility that his Department would have to work with other Departments to protect vulnerable sectors such as agrifood, farming, the beef and dairy industries, the pigmeat and poultry sectors and so on.  The Government is under no illusions that if we face the challenges of a no-deal Brexit, clearly we will have to set money aside that otherwise would not be set aside to support sectors to survive the dramatic change in trading circumstances that may result from a no-deal Brexit and tariff trade barriers.  However, what we will not do is create a fund of X hundred million or X billion euro first and then decide how it will get divvied up.  Instead, for many weeks we have had Departments that are responsible for managing certain sectors, such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with the European Commission to examine how we can use all the tools and the necessary financial resources available to us to try to protect these sectors in that transition.  In this context, \"transition\" is the wrong word to use because we will not be in a transition period but in a dramatic cliff-edge change overnight.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has said, for example, and it is a serious thing to have to say, that having spent the past ten years trying to bring the country back into surplus in terms of the budget, a no-deal Brexit may well drive this country back into a deficit because we would have to borrow money to protect and support certain sectors.  I can assure the House there has been much discussion and planning around this issue.<\/p> <p>I believe I said earlier that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a team in Brussels today talking to the Commission about no-deal Brexit planning in terms of the available tools and precedent from which the European Commission may be able to learn in the context of the kinds of supports we would need to put in place.  It is not as simple as just setting up a Brexit stabilisation fund.  Instead, there is the challenge and the response to that challenge needs to be designed first, and then we need a funding mechanism that can respond to that.

I recognise the diplomatic efforts he and his Department are undertaking as the Brexit process draws to a conclusion, if that is even the case.  It is hard to see any conclusion emerging but we are doing our bit.  The T&aacute;naiste's leadership has been very much in evidence.  I thank him for his work, which is very much appreciated by all Senators.<\/p><p>The comprehensive and extensive nature of the legislation before us today reflects the seriousness with which our preparations for a potential no-deal Brexit have been taken by Government.  I lived in the UK for 17 years and I look on in horror and despair at what is happening there.  I hope some sense returns to the body politic in Westminster where so much good work was done in the time I lived in Britain.  That is not, however, what we are dealing with today.<\/p><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his engagement on this important amendment, in particular with my colleague, Senator Higgins, who is abroad on business and for whom I am a very poor substitute today.  The T&aacute;naiste recognises that this is extraordinary emergency legislation preparing for a major geopolitical event outside of our control and one which will have a wide-ranging impact on the lives of a great many people in this country, potentially for generations.  Its substantial 98 sections amend a total of 37 other Acts across a wide range of policy areas and the remits of nine different Ministers and Departments.<\/p><p>In addition to the amendments to primary legislation, a number of the provisions of the Bill give wide-ranging powers to Ministers - this is at the heart of this amendment - to issue regulations and statutory instruments to respond to a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit in which quick and decisive action may need to be taken and for which statutory flexibility may be required to respond dynamically to the consequences of such an exit as they arise.  Owing to the wide-ranging number of policy areas in which the European Union has competency over member states&rsquo; affairs, it is not surprising that such substantial amendments and regulatory powers have been included in the Bill.  We believe, however, that the significant changes that will arise as a result of the Bill will need to be subject to a higher than usual level of parliamentary scrutiny and review.  This is the motivation for tabling amendment No. 36.  The amendment requires that within 12 months of the enactment of the legislation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would conduct a review of the Act as a whole and that each Minister with competency for provisions of this omnibus Bill would review the provisions relating to his or her remit.  The results of these reviews and conclusions drawn from them would then be laid before the Oireachtas within six months.  We need to ensure the provisions of the Bill are working as intended and Ministers are using appropriately the regulatory powers extended to them if the Bill is enacted.<\/p><p>While I recognise that D&aacute;il and Seanad Standing Orders already provide for post-enactment scrutiny reports, we want to ensure the post-enactment process for this legislation is as comprehensive and robust as the scrutiny its provisions have received since publication.  I welcome that most relevant Oireachtas committees have met specifically to interrogate the Bill's provisions in light of the tight time constraints.  We want the post-enactment process to be just as detailed and conducted sector by sector and Department by Department, rather than by a single Minister.  While the legislation may be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister may not be able to give a proper account of how, for example, the student grant arrangements in Part 5 of the Bill are working out, or if the social welfare or insolvency provisions in Parts 11 and 12 are working.  This is the main motivation for the amendment.<\/p><p>The amendment would simply place on a statutory footing the requirement to have a sector by sector review conducted by the most appropriate Minister.  It would put in place clear time constraints and oversight mechanisms for the wide-ranging provisions of this crucial legislation and the resulting secondary legislation and statutory instruments.  It is a reasonable request, one that is fair and proportionate to the extraordinary nature of this emergency legislation.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste can accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#HH00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>None of us wishes to see the passage of the Bill being delayed and all of us who spoke on Second Stage yesterday expressed the hope that this legislation will not be necessary.

I will not go over the argument I made on Second Stage, but case law here requires that where policies are being changed, that is done through primary legislation.  I will not press the point with the T&aacute;naiste but it is one about which we raised concerns in the D&aacute;il and I just wanted to reiterate it.  It seems a sensible idea that one would scrutinise, in particular, what Ministers have done under the auspices of the statute that seems to go beyond the normal empowerment of providing delegated legislation which simply puts into effect principles that are contained in primary legislation through statutory instruments.  This is a concern we had but the position of the Labour Party has been that we will facilitate the passage of the Bill and not seek to obstruct it anyway.  I wanted to put that point again on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#HH00500","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Before I address the amendment, I will address that point because Deputy Howlin raised it with me on Second and Committee Stages.  We asked the hard questions on that.  This comes back to what this legislation is doing.  It is not about empowering Ministers to introduce new legislation in new areas of policy.  It is about effectively protecting existing arrangements and rights.  As a result of that, this is not giving a delegated power to a Minister to introduce legislation in new areas without recourse to the Oireachtas.  Instead, it is about giving a Minister power - in the case of health, for example, where there are a lot of delegated powers - to maintain the existing level of services, whether this is cross-Border healthcare or whatever.  Deputy Howlin was correct to raise those issues and to test them legally.  They are issues the Attorney General gave us advice on and we are comfortable legally with that.<\/p> <p>On the amendment itself, I thank Senators Kelleher, Ruane, Dolan, Black, Grace O'Sullivan and, in particular, Senator Higgins, to whom I have spoken about this amendment and her concerns around it, for their constructive engagement on a post-enactment scrutiny both today and throughout the legislative process, more broadly.  Although I am not in a position to support the amendment as tabled, I agree with the purpose of the amendment and the motivation behind it.  We fully agree that given the emergency nature of the legislation, a period for reflection and review of the legislation, if enacted and commenced, would be appropriate and useful.  However, rather than a specific legislative measure, such as the amendment as tabled, it is our intention to provide the review mechanisms under D&aacute;il Standing Order 164A and Seanad Standing Order 168, which read as follows: \"Twelve months following the enactment of a Bill, save in the case of the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill, the member of the Government or Minister of State who is officially responsible for implementation of the Act shall provide a report which shall review the functioning of the Act and which shall be laid in the Parliamentary Library.\"  It is envisaged that it would be the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence that would consider the post-enactment report on the Bill.<\/p> <p>In addition, each of my Cabinet colleagues is committed to ongoing engagement on the nuts and bolts impacts of the measures of their Parts of the Bill, with their respective committees.  This would, therefore, provide the opportunity to identify and address any teething problems with and-or any unforeseen effects of the Bill.  In other words, because this is emergency legislation, we have to be extra cautious afterwards that we follow through on ensuring that what we are trying to do here is what has resulted from the effect of the Bill itself.  We may have to amend the legislation if we have missed something.  It is unusual because of the number of Ministers and Government Departments who are all involved in one Bill.  On the commencement orders for those individual Parts, it is up to the individual Ministers to commence different Parts of the Bill, once it is approved by the President, and becomes law.<\/p> <p>For all of those reasons and while I accept the spirit of the amendment to which we are responding quite comprehensively - we have given Senator Higgins quite a lot of detail in response to her concerns, which I believe she accepts - I cannot accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in particular for the specific responses he has given me on the issues I have raised.  there has never been a Bill, the potential enactment of which has been more dreaded by everybody in both Houses.  Certainly we all hope it will not be necessary, and it was very distressing for all of us to see the majority vote against the withdrawal agreement last night, largely prompted by, in my view, deeply flawed legal advice from the Attorney General , the Rt Hon. Geoffrey Cox.  Having written many legal opinions for many years, the first 18 paragraphs of his opinion were leading to a very different conclusion than the sudden whammy in the 19th paragraph, which sank any prospect of the DUP and the ERG signing up to the withdrawal agreement.  Clearly, what has happened has happened and we very much hope that the House of Commons will indeed vote against a no deal tonight and may then seek to push for an extension.  I know the Minister has said in the D&aacute;il that Ireland will not stand against an application for an extension, but clearly there has to be a ground for an extension, so it is very hard to see a way through.  We all recognise that this is a crisis of British making and it has to be resolved primarily in the House of Commons and in Westminster.

Well done to the Cathaoirleach and everybody in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019031300002#KK00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1552476600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Mar fhocal scoir, gabhaim mo chomhghairdeas le gach &eacute;inne a chabhraigh leis an T&aacute;naiste agus leis an Teach an Bille seo a shocr&uacute;.

All Members can be very proud of the role that the T&aacute;naiste has played in developing friendships, building synergies across Europe, and ensuring that we will never have to enact this Bill.<\/p> <p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work he has done.  On a personal level, it has been difficult for him as he has been away from his family.  He has travelled across Europe and the world, making friendships and building up alliances.  Today, as we conclude our business on this Bill, there are Ministers travelling the world telling the story of the importance of Irishness and the importance of Ireland in the context of a post-Brexit world.  I am not going to strike a discordant note in my final contribution, but to the members of Sinn F&eacute;in, the words of W. B. Yeats come to mind when I hear talk of a Border poll: \"Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.\"<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Yeats also wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Think where man's glory most begins and ends,<br \/><br \/>And say my glory was I had such friends.<\/blockquote><p>It is now that we need friends in Europe and that we need to wear the green jersey as we all have done and will do.

Hopefully, some common sense will prevail across the water over the next 48 hours.  In the meantime, I wish the T&aacute;naiste and the Government well in these difficult times.  As a seafaring man, the T&aacute;naiste will appreciate that it is like trying to navigate the Zambezi river without a rudder.  There are difficult issues ahead not alone for us but particularly for the UK.  We are the country that will be most affected because we are on the periphery of Europe.
