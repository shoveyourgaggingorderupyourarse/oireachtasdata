I make the point that the issues are fundamentally of a policy nature and there are important policy principles at stake.  It is very important that the Government makes it clear that it supports the principle of a State-supported public service transport company.  I want to make it clear that we do and that we think flowing from that should be a determined effort to ensure the existing issues and challenges are resolved.<\/p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that there had been significant cuts to the public subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann in recent years, from &euro;49 million in 2009 to &euro;36 million this year.  While that represents an increase this year over last year, it indicates nonetheless the significant change in terms of public subvention that has occurred.  In terms of the operation of the free travel scheme, Bus &Eacute;ireann receives approximately &euro;4.86 per passenger on a route compared with the fare of &euro;11.78, and it is clear there is a yawning gap between those figures as well.  Those are two avenues that are available to the Government of the day in terms of ensuring the retention and viability of any public service transport company.  The route licensing system needs to be reviewed and Deputy Troy has articulated that on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  I make the point that decent wages are important.  In this society and in developed economies where there is growing inequality between those on very high wages and those on low wages, the state has a role to play to ensure there is some decent degree of incomes policy in certain sectors of the economy.  In certain sectors there have been very significant downward pressures because of globalisation and we have seen the political dislocation and disruption that has occurred as a result.  That is a significant issue in the context of the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute as well, and of that there is no doubt.  That is something the Government must weigh up.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Court has declined to get involved.  I have been making the point consistently to the Taoiseach that this is not only a narrow management-union issue.  It is a broader issue in terms of public policy and transport policy.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport needs to convene talks between the National Transport Authority, which has a critical role in such matters as licensing, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the various trade unions involved to iron out the policy framework and the key issues that can form the background to a successful resolution of the outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500003#A00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1485345900,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Obviously, this is a matter of policy.  However, it is also a matter of commercial reality.  Essentially, the matter is under discussion between the management and trade unions.  The Oireachtas joint committee is currently hearing from the acting chief executive officer of Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the company's current difficulties.  Government policy in this area is that the travelling public should have access to the best quality in transport services, whether that is in frequency or choice of routes.  That should apply for customers and for commuters.  There have been a number of positive changes in the last couple of years which have resulted in more services, better frequencies and more competitive fares and the travelling public has voted with its feet.  The number for the use of commercial bus services was approximately 23 million in 2015.  We should welcome first and foremost the fact that more people are using public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform granted an increase of 17% in the subvention this year and it is now up to &euro;35 million.  However, it is a commercial fact that passenger growth has not been experienced in the Expressway arm of Bus &Eacute;ireann, a service that competes with other operators.  I gave Deputy Troy the number of licences issued in recent years in response to a point that was raised.  There was some misunderstanding about the number issued.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the trade unions and management can continue to engage in a realistic and constructive fashion about this serious matter.  There are those who try to ascribe what is happening to a policy failing.  However, as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and I have stated, this is a commercial problem and it deserves a commercial response.  That means a resolution between the company and the trade unions must be found.  We must be very clear about this.  At the heart of this public policy issue is the travelling public.  The overarching objective is to get more people to use public transport.  I have already pointed to the improvements that have been made.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the Deputy's reference to the National Transport Authority, NTA, the authority stands ready to intervene with regard to rural Ireland, if required to do so, to ensure public transport connectivity if commercial services are reconfigured following the discussions that take place between the management and the trade unions.  The NTA has issued invitations to political parties and groups so that it can explain its role and responsibility in this area.  Nobody, least of all the Government or the Minister, underestimates the difficulties Bus &Eacute;ireann faces.

Four or five weeks ago we were told that Expressway was the real issue but, subsequently, it has become the entire company.  With the use of terms such as \"insolvency\" matters have ratcheted up, culminating in the premature move to the Labour Court yesterday by the management side.  That move backfired.  It appears that something is afoot.  People such as the Minister and others are saying their fingerprints are on nothing and they are not involved, yet everybody thinks their fingerprints are well and truly on a policy that is being pursued to a degree by stealth.  A little more transparency from all would be welcome.

The Minister is very anxious that management and unions sit down and negotiate on the central issue, which is the commercial loss-making end of the Expressway service.  The NTA has a different role and responsibility here.<\/p> <p> The Minister has pointed out that in the event of Expressway services being reconfigured, where it impacts on rural Ireland the NTA is available to provide connectivity to those rural areas.  This will also be impacted on in part by the publication and implementation of the programme to deal with the potential of rural Ireland.  It is a serious matter but central policy is that more people, customers, consumers and travelling people should use the public bus services.  Improvements have been made during recent years including new frequencies, new routes and increased competitiveness.

I commend Deputy Tommy Broughan on sponsoring the motion.  On that fateful St. Valentine's night, 48 people died and 214 people were injured.  Some of the family members are in Leinster House today, in the Public Gallery.  I extend my continued sympathy and solidarity to them and the survivors.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion.<\/p>  <p>  Today, 36 years later, the families have still not got the full truth about how their loved ones died.  There are also valid questions about the totally inadequate way in which the tragedy was investigated and dealt with by the institutions of the State.  The original Keane inquiry into the Stardust fire claimed that it was caused by probable arson.  The finding was overturned in 2009 as a result of the independent examination by Mr. Paul Coffey, SC.  This led to the correction of the public record, which exonerated those present in the Stardust nightclub of any blame.  The families of the victims of the Stardust tragedy are seeking a new commission of investigation into this dreadful tragedy.  They say they have new evidence.<\/p>  <p>  The onus should not be on the families of the victims to bring forward new evidence.  It is the responsibility of the State and its agencies.  In his report sent to the Government on 10 December 2008, on page 70, section 5.13, Mr. Coffey stated: \"I further accept that a new inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence.\"  However, this recommendation was not contained in the published report of January 2009.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised these questions with the Taoiseach previously and he has rejected calls for a new inquiry.  The families say the new evidence indicates that the fire started in the roof space and have presented it to the Department of Justice and Equality.  The State has never given proper weight to other claims pointing to the culpability of the owners of the complex.  The owners of the Stardust received compensation; the families have not.  Will the Taoiseach support the families in their search for justice?  Will he establish a new commission of investigation into the tragedy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500005#C00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1485346200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Adams in his expression of sympathy to families who lost 48 members in the Stardust fire 35 years ago.  Nothing we say or do can bring back those loved ones.  Those of us who can remember the tragedy on that weekend can never forget it.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, negotiated, both on his own behalf and with his group, putting a particular issue about the Stardust fire into the programme for Government, which was agreed and accepted.  That element which he negotiated states, \"Full regard will be had to any new evidence which emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at Stardust.\"  That is from the programme for Government, adopted by the House, and which was negotiated by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  He has had a personal interest in this matter for many years, as indeed have other Members - such as Deputy Broughan, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and Deputy Haughey - in the constituencies affected.<\/p> <p> It has been 35 years since the Stardust fire.  Up to 214 people were injured.  Families and relatives of the victims of the tragedy have never received full and complete answers as to what occurred on the night of 14 February 1981.  As Deputy Adams knows, in order to have any inquiry, there has to be a basis for it.  There was a full-scale tribunal of inquiry and the Coffey report into the fire.  Arising from both of these, questions were asked and people felt strongly that answers were not given.  There are discussions taking place as we speak in respect of this matter.  I want to express a willingness that there should be a commission of investigation.  The basis upon which that has to take place is one that is being discussed by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice Equality and the Minister of State at the Department of Health.<\/p> <p> Obviously, I would like to see the evidence that has been produced, which is purported to be new evidence that would warrant a commission investigation.  There is no disregard to the principle of having a commission of investigation.  It is a very sensitive matter.  For people who lost loved ones and family members, they can never be brought back.  They do deserve to have every attempt made to provide them with answers to their particular questions.  Deputy Adams and I have discussed this in the context of so many other areas regarding Northern Ireland, with tragedies on one side or the other.  Many of those obviously remain incomplete.<\/p> <p> I hope the discussions that are under way will bring about a conclusion whereby matters can be progressed.

Leaving that to one side, the fact is that 48 people died and a further 214 were injured.  Families were devastated.  The Taoiseach is quite right to say that families will never recover.  I know that from my personal experience.  One never recovers.  A community has been deeply scarred.  The first inquiry's findings have to be set one side.  Even that on its own, justifies what the families are asking for.  There are also credible questions about the investigation by the State of this entire disaster.  The Taoiseach said there is a willingness for there to be a commission of investigation.  Will he just say that he will authorise a commission of investigation finally?

Across Ireland this morning, buses delivered people to their schools, places of work, shops, homes and offices.  Outside of Dublin, many, if not most, of those buses were operated for or on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann, our national bus company.  Over recent months, we have heard a lot of noise but have received little clarity about the future of this vital national company.  There are conflicting reports on the status of Expressway and numerous scenarios as to what is actually happening within the company.  What has become clear is that the crisis is being used to slash the terms and conditions of front-line staff working in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This will further add to the race to the bottom in workers' terms and conditions across the bus industry.  I understand proposals have been put forward that would cut earnings by 30%.  They are also using a pay offer - a rise of 2% per year is supposed to address that incredible deficit.  There is a registered employment agreement in place covering bus workers that has been ignored by bus management in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I believe they are trying to bypass the industrial relations machinery of the State.  The cack-handed attempt by the company management to bring this crisis to the Labour Court yesterday was refused by the court.  This was after management had failed to participate in a Labour Court pay claim from staff just before Christmas.  No doubt, reforms and changes may need to be made to work practices.  No sector can avoid the need for ongoing modernisation but these changes have to be negotiated.  Instead, management has been engaged in a public relations doomsday exercise to set an agenda for confrontation with the trade union movement.  The reality is the National Transport Authority, NTA, licences are awarded to private operators in which there are no employment conditions attaching, in effect allowing a race to the bottom on terms and conditions for bus drivers.  This crisis goes to the heart of what is driving economic inequality.  Instead of lifting up all bus drivers to an even playing field, we have a bonfire of rights and conditions and a race to the bottom.  I have no doubt the clerical and driver staff members of Bus &Eacute;ireann would be willing to discuss proposals to ensure the company remains viable but they cannot do that with a gun to their head.  They cannot do that if the entire pitch is tilted against them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has removed himself from all of this.  He is now a spectator and I am interested to know where he is now - most of the Cabinet is here - when two important Leaders' Questions are put on this issue to the Taoiseach.  I want to ask the Taoiseach two brief questions.  Does he support the current approach of management in Bus &Eacute;ireann, a company that is owned entirely by the State?  Would he support a sectoral employment order to cover the bus industry to ensure the terms and conditions of workers are protected and that there is an even playing field for all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500007#E00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1485346800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin.  Few people in the House know as much about this as does the Deputy.  He has had experience of the industrial relations machinery of the State being made available to many companies in the past.  This is not the first occasion we have had some difficulties with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The difficulties of the past have been ironed out on each occasion by using that machinery and by using the negotiation capacity that exists between management and trade unions.<\/p><p>It is true to say that 23 million public passengers used Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2015.  It is also true to say, as the Deputy pointed out, that many thousands of school children are brought either by Bus &Eacute;ireann or by another provider, under contract, to their schools and home safely in the evening.  As I said to Deputy Martin earlier, &euro;35 million of a subvention, which represents an increase of 17%, was made available by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform this year.  This is an issue of public policy in terms of attracting more people to use public services such as the public transport service.  The central issue in respect of the Expressway service is one that needs to be dealt with because the commercial reality is that it is a loss-making area.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has pointed out that if there is a reconfiguration of the Expressway service that it stands ready to provide connectivity to rural areas that would lose that service were that to happen.<\/p> <p> The Deputy made a few other points.  As I said earlier, the chief executive, who is serving in an acting capacity, is before an Oireachtas inquiry now.

The answer to this, as the Deputy is well aware, is to engage with the facilities of the State where these particular problems and confrontations can be discussed, negotiated and concluded.<\/p> <p> My understanding is that the engagement with the Labour Court yesterday was about the requirements that have to be put in place in order that discussions can take place on it.  It will not be sorted out in here by megaphone politics.

There is a duty on Government to protect its people against incompetent rogue cowboy builders.  This duty extends to tidying up, once and for all, the mess and the shoddy workmanship that is allowed to go on unchecked and unregulated.

Where is the remedy?  What redress and tangible support do these hardworking people have when they discover major defects in their homes?  In many cases, the builders and developers have gone bust.  However, our forgiving corporate insolvency laws allow them to return to the workforce.

We had this before with Priory Hall and Longboat Quay, and now we have it in this instance.  The solution is one that was never implemented in the first place.  When planning permissions are issued by local authorities for major developments such as these, it is very simple to have a clerk of works appointed to supervise the job and, where greed arises or contractors decide to cut corners, order them to take the development down and rebuild it properly.  However, during the exceptional boom - when everybody assumed we would all be millionaires without having to do any work - corners were cut.  In the cases of Longboat Quay and Priory Hall, greed was a central element which impacted on the lives of the people involved.  The answer to this question is that when planning permissions are given, there must be an oversight authority to see that the building is in accordance with the planning conditions issued.  I cannot say to the Deputy that there are not other Priory Halls, Longboat Quays or other instances of what she has pointed out.  It is not just about building regulations.  They are important, and building standards are critical, but it is also about supervising the developments.  If one grants permission for X number of developments and there is nobody to supervise what happens, one must be able to take the risk that the standard should be as one would expect, which is not what has happened in the case to which the Deputy refers.<\/p>  <p>  This issue and what should be done about it are a focus of the Minister for Housing.  In my view, where this has happened over the years, be it in individual cases, group apartments or major developments, the supervisory authority needs to be appointed either independently or by the local authority which grants the planning applications in the first instance.  I have had numerous experiences over the years of cases in which contractors did have to obey the law and the rules and where those who did not were punished for not doing so.  This is not an easy situation for the tenants in these apartments.  They paid big money for the dream homes, as the Deputy says, to which they aspire.  We had the same situation with pyrite on so many occasions.  I cannot say to her that this has not happened elsewhere.  From speaking to the families of those who lost children and young students in the Berkeley balcony collapse, I know that the position is the same in other countries where corners were cut and standards not realised.<\/p><p>This is an issue that requires a response and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has already set out these standards.  It is a case of implementing and supervising them in all developments.  I cannot tell the Deputy this is the last case in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500009#G00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485348000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>While I appreciate the Taoiseach's recognition that we need a supervisory authority, the fact is local authority building control is greatly underfunded.  In many cases claims against builders are statute barred because defects were not noticed by home owners in the legally stipulated period and there are still no solutions for people whose homes were built pre-2014.<\/p><p>The huge legislative gap which exists in this area more than five years after Priory Hall is staggering.  How many times must this issue rear its ugly head before the people who are affected by it have some level of certainty about the relief they can seek?  Are they forever to be reliant on a Government which acts in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>wait-to-see manner?  These are people's homes and it should be a `Government priority that if anything happens to people&rsquo;s homes, they should not be left in limbo.

Obviously, things have changed and engineers are required to sign off on certificates of standards, whether on small issues or major developments.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy makes the point that home owners did not notice the defects.  How could they?  Many home owners would not have any practical experience of building standards or of how buildings are constructed.  Where rogue contractors, either through greed or taking short cuts, put defective buildings together, or fire traps as was the case in Priory Hall, they are guilty of a grossly serious offence.  In my view they should never be allowed to build again, or not for a very long time.  Their certificates of competency should be withdrawn.  We need a supervisory independent clerk of works or authority to say that is not what they got permission for, that is not the standard, and they must take it down and rebuild it.  If they find that somebody signs off on a certificate saying it is of quality that it is not, that person should pay the penalty as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500010#H00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Questions on Promised Legislation","time":1485348000,"counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500010#H00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1485348000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Today there are in excess of 493 patients on trolleys waiting for admission to our country's hospitals.

What is happening arises from an independent review conducted by the Department to ascertain the optimum structure for the laboratory service bearing in mind its obligation to serve rural communities, the requirements of the staff employed therein and the importance of the service in underpinning the export industry, which generates so much valuable employment both inside and outside the farm gate.  A consultation phase is under way with staff and no decisions have yet been taken.  The review posits a series of options, one of which is the centralisation option.

In 2010, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement made a submission to the Department of Justice and Equality seeking such a strengthening of the laws.  Some of its recommendations have not been enacted.  As I noted last night, the former Financial Regulator told the Committee of Public Accounts that our laws are inadequate to hold individuals accountable.  As recently as last year, the Law Reform Commission published an issues paper on white collar crime setting out a number of recommendations.

I then spoke by telephone to both Mr. McGuinness and the DUP leader, Ms Arlene Foster, to explore the possibility of a resolution to the difficulties.  I urged each of them and their parties to engage with each other to find a way forward and avoid a collapse of the Assembly and the Executive.<\/p>  <p>  Later that day I spoke with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, to discuss the situation.  We agreed that our two Governments would continue to work closely over the coming period and that we would keep in close contact.  We also agreed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, would work together to see if a way forward could be found before an election had to be triggered.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, again on the evening of Monday, 16 January when it became clear there would be no nomination of a deputy First Minister and that, therefore, an election was inevitable.  We repeated our desire to see the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement operating effectively, in particular to have a fully functioning Executive in place as soon as possible following the election and the decision of the people.<\/p>  <p>  As that election campaign gets under way, I call on all parties to enter into it in a calm and respectful manner.  More than ever, this is a time for responsible and positive leadership.  When these elections are over, whatever the results, the parties will be required to work together and with the two Governments to chart a way forward for Northern Ireland.  The Government will continue to be very active in seeking an input into Northern Ireland's interests as we prepare for the Brexit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I note that since our discussions, Mr. McGuinness has announced that he will not contest the next election due to his ill health.  I issued a statement last week expressing my appreciation of his efforts to secure a lasting peace in Northern Ireland and wishing him and his family the very best as he deals with his illness.  I am grateful for this opportunity in the House to repeat those messages.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate Ms Michelle O'Neill on her appointment as the new leader of Sinn F&eacute;in in the Northern Ireland Assembly and I look forward to working with her and her colleagues, and all of the parties in Northern Ireland, to ensure the stability of the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I have not had any discussions with President Trump regarding recent developments in Northern Ireland.

I think it is interesting.  There was not a whole lot of commentary about it either, which is interesting as well in terms of the degree of analysis and questioning of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  I note that an independent inquiry into the renewable heating scandal has now been established in recent days and that involved a complete U-turn on behalf of the Minister involved.  The worst aspect about this is that it has been set up in such a way that the people of Northern Ireland will be given no answers before they vote and all they will hear are the political claims and counter-claims.<\/p>  <p>  We should also note Deputy Adams's speech here last week when he stated that Sinn F&eacute;in had never done anything wrong in government, had never ignored smaller parties and is completely spotless in spite of the revelations about party funding, sectarian appointments, etc.  During Question Time yesterday, the truly incredible claim was made that others are to blame, for example, for the failure to establish the civic forum even though Sinn F&eacute;in closed it down and opposed its return.  Using the phrase of the moment, they are offering so-called alternative facts.<\/p>  <p>  The DUP has behaved appallingly over recent years and it has to change fundamentally or there can be no progress.

I explained to him the peace walls and the fragility of many of the issues that arise in Northern Ireland and he, as one Prime Minister, understands that, is very supportive of it and will continue to be so in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500021#T00800","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1485354300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>That concludes questions to the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500021#T00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1485354300,"counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500021#T01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1485354300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Lisa Chambers, Mick Barry and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh - working conditions for Air Corps personnel at Casement Aerodrome; (2) Deputy Eugene Murphy - the appointment of a child psychologist for north Roscommon; (3) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - over-capacity difficulties with children under six years for GPs in Balbriggan; (4) Deputies John Curran and Maureen O'Sullivan - the withdrawal of funding by the HSE north Dublin for Tiglin rehabilitation service; (5) Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - concerns for local authorities selling homes under the tenant incremental purchase scheme 2016; (6) Deputy Pearse Doherty - clarification on referrals for chemotherapy treatments at Letterkenny University Hospital; (7) Deputy Michael D'Arcy - the reinstatement of Gorey Garda district in line with the programme for Government 2016; (8) Deputy Martin Kenny - the threatened closure of veterinary laboratories throughout the country; (9) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - job security for employees at the Bord na M&oacute;na plant in Kilberry, County Kildare; (10) Deputies Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, Brendan Smith, Thomas Byrne, Shane Cassells and Niamh Smyth - the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector; (11) Deputy Tony McLoughlin - plans for a fixed cardiac catheterisation lab at Sligo University Hospital in 2017; (12) Deputy John Lahart - decision to close St. Brigid's nursing home in south Dublin; (13) Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey - the provision of ambulance services in Dublin; (14) Deputy Ruth Coppinger - the closure of Westbourne hostel direct provision centre in Limerick; (15) Deputy Imelda Munster - funding for preservation works at the 13th century barbican, St. Laurence's Gate in Drogheda town; (16) Deputies Dessie Ellis and Noel Rock - funding of the over-50s intergenerational learning programme in DCU; (17) Deputy Bernard J.

The agenda included the current migration situation, security and defence, a range of economic and social development issues, including on youth and external relations, specifically the situation in Syria, and the Dutch ratification of the EU association agreement with Ukraine.  We discussed a number of additional topics, including Russia, Cyprus, energy union, the Single Market and the digital Single Market.  I also had an exchange with Mario Draghi about the European economy.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The digital Single Market is a priority for Ireland and, in advance of the European Council meeting, I wrote a letter to President Tusk, which was co-signed by 15 other EU leaders, calling for greater ambition in the period ahead.<\/p> <p> I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to address the question on Russia, the Ukraine ratification point and the economic issues in his closing remarks.  <\/p> <p> Following the December European Council meeting, there was a short meeting of the 27 EU Heads of State and Government focusing on how the Brexit negotiations will be managed from an EU perspective.  We agreed that the European Council will conclude guidelines for the negotiations once Article 50 is triggered.  The Commission, with Michel Barnier as its chief negotiator, will lead those technical negotiations.  The General Affairs Council, the European Parliament, the Committee of Permanent Representatives and official-level working groups will also play important roles in the process.  As set out in the statement after the meeting, the 27 Heads of State and Government will remain permanently apprised of and involved in the negotiations and will update the guidelines as necessary.<\/p> <p> At our meeting we also reconfirmed the principles that there can be no negotiation without notification, that the Single Market and the four freedoms are indivisible and that until the withdrawal negotiations are concluded, the UK remains a full member of the EU.  There was no detailed discussion about the future of Europe.  This will be the focus of a separate summit in Malta on 3 February before that process concludes in March coinciding with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.<\/p> <p> I used the opportunity to engage with my EU counterparts at both meetings to emphasise again Ireland's particular concerns around Brexit, including in respect of Northern Ireland, the peace process, the Border issues, the common travel area and our deeply entwined economic and trade links.<\/p> <p> I am aware of Deputy Adams's remarks over the weekend on the dangers of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the British Government's restatement of its commitment to the implementation of the agreements and its determination that there will be no return to \"borders of the past\".  These are matters on which the Prime Minister and I are agreed.<\/p> <p> As far back as my address to the British-Irish Association in Oxford last September, I set out our concerns and approach, including in respect of Northern Ireland.  We want to maintain the common travel area, avoid any return to a hard Border, sustain EU support for the peace process and continue to facilitate North-South business and trade, both in its own right and in the context of maintaining trade more generally across these islands.<\/p> <p> I have emphasised these points in all my meetings with EU leaders as part of a broader Government programme of engagement with all member states and with the EU institutions in which we are constantly emphasising our specific Brexit-related concerns and issues.  That programme is now being intensified as we move towards the triggering of Article 50.  For my own part, I travelled to Spain for discussions with Prime Minister Rajoy earlier this month and I will continue to engage with other leaders in the weeks ahead.<\/p> <p> In my statement to the House last week, I assured Members of our ongoing deep commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.  As co-guarantor of that Agreement, the Irish Government worked assiduously, together with the British Government and the political parties, to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland. <\/p> <p> The scale and complexity of the challenges presented by Brexit underline the importance of the existing institutions as mechanisms for working together.  <\/p> <p> It is deeply regrettable that the dissolution of the Northern Ireland Executive leaves the people of Northern Ireland without political leadership at this key moment.  The Government has made it clear that Northern Ireland and the peace process are among our top priorities for the coming negotiations.  The last thing we want to see is further instability.<\/p> <p> As the UK's date for triggering Article 50 moves closer, the greater the need for us to work together on issues of major concern, particularly where they have a North-South dimension.  That is why we sought to use the North-South Ministerial Council to forge a common approach to Brexit-related issues.  Given the current political uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the progress made so far via the North-South Ministerial Council can be sustained.<\/p> <p> I welcome the greater clarity provided in Prime Minister May's speech last week on the proposed approach of the British Government to the negotiations.  While the speech has been interpreted by many as a hard exit, the analysis across this Government has covered all possible models for the future UK relationship with the EU.<\/p> <p> Through the Cabinet committee on Brexit, which I chair and which will meet again tomorrow, the Government has ensured that we have a clear and comprehensive Brexit plan in place.  That plan covers a deep analysis of all the issues across Government, extensive consultation and engagement, pursuit of our key priorities in our consultations with our EU partners and the EU institutions, including the Barnier task force.  The plan covers identifying risks and potential measures to address them, as well as pursuit of the opportunities arising from the UK decision.  All of this work is being driven by a complex co-ordination process, beginning with the Cabinet committees which I chair, including an extensive range of official working groups, and mobilising Ministers, diplomats and officials right across our system.  <\/p> <p> These preparations will stand to us as we move closer to the triggering of Article 50.  A key part of this is the Government's initiative on the All-Island Civic Dialogue which began on 2 November.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I will host a second plenary session of the civic dialogue on Friday, 17 February, by which time 14 civic dialogue sectoral events will also have taken place.  This will be a further important element of our engagement and consultation on the challenges of Brexit.<\/p> <p> Nobody should be under any doubt that Brexit is the top priority across Government and a competent and comprehensive plan is in place and is being executed.  <\/p> <p> In the Government statement of last Tuesday, it was made clear that the critical negotiation priorities have been identified, the programme of dialogue will continue, vigilance and engagement on economic risks and challenges will be maintained, economic opportunities for Ireland will be pursued, engagement with other member states and EU institutions will intensify, Ireland will negotiate as one of the 27 member states firmly in, and committed to, the European Union and Ireland will participate fully in the discussions on the future direction of the EU. <\/p> <p> Returning to the December European Council meeting, this began with the outgoing President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, attending for the last time in that role.  Slovakia's Prime Minister Fico made a presentation on the implementation of European Council decisions and the President of Cyprus provided an update on developments in the ongoing reunification talks.<\/p> <p> The European Council heard a moving presentation from the president of the local council of eastern Aleppo who set out some of the appalling atrocities which have been visited upon the citizens of that city.  The excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force by the regime, supported by its allies, constitutes a clear violation of international law.  The European Council was unequivocal in its conclusions, noting that those responsible for breaches of international law, some of which may well amount to war crimes, must be held accountable for their actions.<\/p> <p> The European Council also considered the migration and refugee situation.  The Commission gave an update on progress on relocation and resettlement and on the EU-Turkey statement.  A particular emphasis was placed on member states fulfilling their commitments to relocation and to the European Asylum Support Office.  We had a discussion around the proposals for reforming the common European asylum system.  It is hoped that consensus on how to reform EU asylum policy can be reached during the Maltese Presidency although this will be dependent on changes in member states' positions.<\/p> <p> The Commission briefed on the migration compacts which are being developed with third countries.  These aim to ensure coherence between migration, external and development policies.  We welcome the development of the migration compacts, as well as making swift progress on the European Fund for Sustainable Development and on the European Investment Bank, EIB, external lending mandate.<\/p> <p> Ireland is working to fulfil our pledge to up to 4,000 people.  In 2016, 519 people were taken in under the resettlement commitment.  On relocation - taking migrants from Greece and Italy - progress has been slower, but 241 people came to Ireland from Greece last year.  The plan is to receive up to 1,100 people by September this year.<\/p> <p> We provided more than &euro;67 million in response to the Syrian crisis since 2012 and our Naval Service vessels rescued 15,621 migrants in the Mediterranean in the past two years.<\/p> <p>  Under security, the discussion dealt with the Commission communication on a European defence action plan, implementation of the EU global strategy and follow up to the July EU-NATO joint declaration.<\/p> <p> It is important to emphasise that the EU common security and defence policy, CSDP, and co-operation with other organisations in this area is grounded within the EU treaties and the Lisbon protocol.  These protect Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Our approach to security and defence is constructive and realistic.  We are strong supporters of initiatives, through CSDP, which improve the capacity of the EU to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN.<\/p> <p> EU-NATO co-operation is framed by the joint declaration agreed last July.  This stipulates that co-operation will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any country, including Ireland, and will fully respect the decision-making autonomy of both organisations.  I assure the House that co-operation between the two organisations is very consistent with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.<\/p> <p> We also considered the implementation of the EU global strategy in the area of security and defence.  This strategy commits to promoting peace, democracy and the rule of law.  It has a positive focus on disarmament, the UN, the Middle East peace process and multilateralism.  It also recognises the need to further invest in conflict resolution, tackle the root causes of instability and support international peace and economic development.<\/p> <p> Under this heading, the European Commission communication on a European defence action plan looks at the capabilities required for EU peacekeeping and crisis management activities.  The European Council stressed the importance of fully involving member states in the proposals that will be brought forward and Ireland will consider these carefully.<\/p> <p> As I stated, the Minister of State will address the other external relations and economic points in his wrap-up remarks.  I apologise for going a little over the allocated speaking time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500021#T01300","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485355500,"counter":261,"content":"<p>This is a defining moment in both European and international affairs.  Every day we see more and more evidence of deep threats to social, economic and political progress.  The cause of active, law-bound co-operation between states is being actively undermined, and regressive efforts are under way to try to return the world to a failed model of competition which brought so much poverty and conflict in the past.<\/p>  <p>  The narrow majority in last year's Brexit referendum means Ireland finds itself at the very epicentre of the impact of these narrow, nationalist and populist forces.  There is no possible positive scenario for Ireland from Brexit.  The most we can achieve is to mitigate its impact as far as possible.  To achieve this, we need an unprecedented scale and urgency of activity by our Government.  As the Taoiseach knows, Fianna F&aacute;il has from the first moment after the referendum been actively engaged and constructive regarding Ireland's response to Brexit.  We followed a more general response with two very detailed statements delivered in Belfast and Dublin last year.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an area for politics as usual.  It is simply too important.  However, we feel there is no way of avoiding criticism of a response which is simply not good enough.  There is no doubt that there is a lot of activity under way.  We acknowledge this and the work of those involved, but equally there is every reason to doubt that this activity is anywhere near the level we need.  For example, it is unacceptable that we are about to enter into the active stage of negotiations at which we need the widest possible understanding and support, yet the Taoiseach, as he said here yesterday, has personally met only six of the 27 Heads of Government who will be involved.  Now is a time to build coalitions, but the time is being wasted.  Equally, there has been no detailed statement of objectives and, as far as we have been informed, no detailed proposals for handling many of the most important issues.<\/p>  <p>  Prime Minister May's speech last week and yesterday's events in London have confirmed yet again that the United Kingdom Government is pursuing an approach that will cause lasting damage to this island.  As far as anyone can tell, it has ruled out any special status arrangement for Northern Ireland.  Yesterday, the Brexit Secretary of State, David Davis, went as far as to say his priority is to protect the UK single market rather than to ensure that Scotland and Northern Ireland can access the European Union Single Market.  The same goes for the customs union.  Every single official and independent review of the economic impact of the end of the Single Market and customs union on this island has forecast major and permanent damage.  There is already damage from the impact of sterling's fall, but the conclusion of this hard Brexit will be seen in closed businesses, lower employment and weaker public budgets.<\/p>  <p>  The avoidance of queues at the Border is something we must aim for, but this is a smaller part of the wider issue.  Any final exit treaty will have to come before the D&aacute;il for ratification.  We believe that before the commencement of formal negotiations at the end of March or the start of April, a formal national negotiating mandate should be adopted.  The Government's failure to move from banal generalities to hard specifics cannot be allowed to continue.  This mandate should reflect a consensus between pro-European Union parties and the feedback from the consultative forums under way.  To be clear on this, parties which have spent decades attacking the European Union and which paint it as a dark conspiracy against the public must not be allowed to distract the pro-European Union majority from promoting Ireland's strategic interests as a country which will remain a full, active and permanent member of the European Union.  No one is fooled by those who opposed membership and every single European Union treaty but are now screaming about how important maintaining membership is.<\/p>  <p>  As far as Fianna F&aacute;il is concerned, there are a series of specific elements which should be in an acceptable deal.  First, it must protect fully the rights of Northern Ireland citizens to EU citizenship through their rights to Irish citizenship, as enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the Good Friday Agreement.  They must fully retain their rights to travel and live anywhere in the European Union and the other rights contained in the European Union treaties.  Second, we must not accept any changes to the 1998 settlement which alters in any way the core protections and safeguards outlined before the peace referendums.  Central to this is the inclusion of the European Convention on Human Rights on a statutory basis in Northern Ireland's fundamental law and the ability of courts to enforce its operation on the United Kingdom Government and the Northern institutions.  It should be noted that in the House of Commons yesterday, three Ministers refused to commit to the convention's continued enforceability in Northern Ireland post-Brexit.  It is important to repeat to the Taoiseach that we will vote against any treaty, be it the Brexit treaty or a new bilateral treaty, which reduces the European Union's citizenship rights of Irish citizens or which reduces the enforceability of European human rights law in Northern Ireland.  Regarding the role of European Union law in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, we will oppose any change which has not been developed through negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  As we have said before, we believe that the unique situation of Ireland requires that Northern Ireland be given some form of special status.  Yesterday the Taoiseach seemed to imply that no one has any idea what this might mean in practice.  In this he is wrong.  I detailed some of this in my speech in Queen's University, Belfast last November, but to be more practical, special status might mean allowing some form of reduced or removed tariffs on trade conducted solely within the island.  This would be a major departure and would involve substantial monitoring but it may be the only thing to prevent the collapse of cross-Border trade and the damage that would come with that.  Given that the United Kingdom Government appears uninterested in special status, our Government has a responsibility at the very least to table formal proposals.  No matter what, there will be ongoing dislocation for Irish business.  We must demand that Europe shows solidarity and flexibility in helping us.  Therefore, we believe state aid rules should be eased for a transitional period and that a special fund should be put in place to allow for the development of replacement markets and diversification.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, we believe the Government's response is far from adequate.  It has been significant but is nowhere near what is required.  There is no evidence that the personnel resources are in place to manage what should be an emergency level of response.  There was shock last week when it was revealed that the Department of Finance had four officials dealing with Brexit.  This took many people by surprise.  Equally, diplomatic activity at the very highest level must be stepped up.  We would support any reasonable proposal for supplementary funding, but these proposals can only come from Government.<\/p>  <p>  The format for this debate does not allow for the level of detail in which we should engage.  A further detailed debate on this matter should be scheduled in the coming weeks.  We are essentially making ten-minute interventions, and other spokespeople cannot contribute.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the other matters discussed at the summit, the only reasonable way of looking at the agenda is how disappointing and complacent it was.  It is particularly unfortunate that there is no active engagement with the continuing economic turmoil in Greece.  Debt restructuring is desperately needed.  The Greek people have shown an ability to respond, and the Greek Government has long since abandoned its arrogant demand that it be funded by others with no accountability.  This cannot be allowed to drag on until there is another crisis.  We welcome the commitment to speed up implementation of the banking union and hope there are some proposals to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the matter of refugees, particularly from the savage actions of Russia and Syria, I note that the Taoiseach in his statement talked about the attacks \"visited\" upon the people of Aleppo, as if it were some anonymous intervention.  Absent from his speech was any naming of Russia as a core participant in the slaughter in Aleppo along with the Syrian regime.  Sometimes diplomatic language can be too diplomatic in how speeches are framed.  The attempt by a few countries to oppose the principle of solidarity is at best unfortunate.  If these people cannot be classified as refugees, deserving of our support, then no one can.  It is frankly shocking that in the light of the continued aggression against a European state, including an invasion and participation in the criminal attack on the civilians of Aleppo, there are countries demanding a lifting of sanctions against Russia.  There has been a lot of talk about defending Western values against radical terrorism.  How can we defend these values if we ignore the aggression being shown by a strong nation against basic principles, including democracy and freedom?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500023#V00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1485356100,"counter":262,"content":"<p>During statements in advance of the meeting of the European Council on 15 December, I raised with the Taoiseach a number of important issues, not least Brexit.  Since then there have been several developments, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May's speech last Tuesday and a ruling by the British Supreme Court yesterday morning.  In her speech last week the British Prime Minister laid out her stall and her vision for a post-Brexit Britain.  Her vision, if we could call it that, shows she is intent on ignoring the views of the people of the North who, we should not forget, voted to remain in the European Union.  Far from voting with their eyes open to leave the European Union, as Ms May claims, the mandate from citizens there was clear: no to a little Englander approach and no to a hard Border.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling was entirely predictable.  It has implications for the role of the Administrations in the North, Scotland and Wales, and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, was scathing about this yesterday.  Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, however, no court or government can overrule the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the North to remain within the EU, particularly this Parliament and the parties in this D&aacute;il.  The British Government may be intent on ignoring it, but the Taoiseach and his Government cannot.  He will sit at the negotiating table and he must put the case, as I have put it to him many times, for a special designated status for the North within the European Union.  He asked me yesterday to spell out what I mean when I speak of designated special status but today he tells me that he understands our proposal fully, which is proof that a day is a long time in politics.  His newly discovered knowledge of the Sinn F&eacute;in position makes his failure to argue this even more reprehensible.<\/p>  <p>  We want a status for the North with its unique constitutional status based on the vote of the people there.  What could be simpler, more straightforward and democratic than that?  That means protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement's constitutional and institutional arrangements.  It means unfettered access for the entire island of Ireland to the benefits of the European Single Market and the customs union.  It means remaining part of the common travel area with no Border controls or EU frontier on the island of Ireland, maintaining all EU funding streams, protecting EU access to employment, social security, health care, workers' rights and conditions, including health and safety - these are all things that will go - working hours, maternity and paternity leave, contracts, access to pensions and so on.  It also means ensuring Irish citizens in the North, who will continue to be citizens of the EU, continue to enjoy all the rights of such citizenship.  There is a precedent for these unique arrangements, and if there is the political will that has been lacking so far in our Government, it can be achieved.  The Irish Government has a moral and legal duty to stand up for the rights of all citizens in the North.  I once again urge the Taoiseach to adopt that position of seeking a designated special status for the North and to pursue it vigorously in the upcoming negotiations with the other EU member states and with Britain.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this, an all-island vision is crucial and the commitment to Irish unity by the Government and all parties here is fundamental.  We have all signed up to change the status of the North, if that is what the people decide, and the reality of the all-island and all-Ireland nature of the Good Friday Agreement are clear evidence of the unique nature of the Northern statelet.  Proof that the North, contrary to protestations from the Labour Party and the Taoiseach, is a disputed territory is also clear from that part of the Good Friday Agreement which obliges the two Governments to legislate for Irish unity if that is what the people vote for.  Before this the British had made an absolute and totally illegitimate claim to that part of our island.  Before partition they claimed the entire island equally illegitimately.  I am very proud of the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in got rid of that when we got agreement from Mr. Blair to end the Government of Ireland Act 1920.  The British claim to the North is now highly conditional.  Our efforts in this D&aacute;il, even as we deal with the consequences of Brexit, must be to create the conditions where the people will opt for unity.  We have to work at that.  That is a big challenge but it is well within our ability if we have the will to work for this necessary objective and to set aside party political rivalries to do so.  That means all of us should be persuaders for unity.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, we should stop ignoring the vote of the people in the North and uphold their democratic right to remain in the European Union with a special designated status.  I welcome what I think I understand to be the Fianna F&aacute;il position on that.  I want the Taoiseach to take up the same position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500024#W00100","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1485356100,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in completely opposes the EU-Turkey migration agreement, as I have said on several occasions in the House.  I have raised this on any platform I could, for example, at last week's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and in this Chamber.  I cannot understand how under any criteria the European Commission can designate Turkey as a safe country.  How can a country that regularly violates the civil and human rights of its own citizens and others as well as having a complete breakdown in the rule of law be considered safe?<\/p>  <p>  A recently leaked letter from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, showed that it has been kept from visiting asylum seekers after they were deported from Greece to Turkey.  At the time the Commission stated that the UNHCR would be a key actor in the resettlement process of the EU-Turkey deal, yet now it appears it is refused access to refugee camps in Turkey.  This is a very serious development.  Was the Taoiseach aware of this?  Did he speak out against it?  Did he raise any concerns or unease at this clear violation of human rights oversight when the issue was discussed at the European Council meeting?  Maybe he was not aware of this leaked document.  Will he and the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, raise it at the next meeting?  This is a very serious development.  This was one of the arguments that was put forward at the time.<\/p>  <p>  More worrying is the Commission's plan to copy this type of model and negotiate similar agreements, some with failed states such as Libya and Mali.  Bizarrely, this European Council meeting welcomed the progress made in implementing these agreements.  Are people not aware of what is happening in Libya and Mali?  They welcome as some sort of barrier the fact that we will send people who are fleeing into Europe for protection back to these states.  It is a stain on the EU's record that it is negotiating agreements that will violate international law and human rights in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said the Irish naval personnel rescued 15,621 people.  That is positive work.  More than 5,000 people drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach sanctuary in Europe last year.  It is literally a graveyard.  The EU in its wisdom is now putting them on boats and sending them back supposedly to where they came from or stopped off, where they might have been exploited, robbed or even raped.  There does not seem to be anything in the conclusions from this meeting concerning the desperate conditions that refugees are experiencing in Greece and the Balkans during this freezing cold weather.  Are the leaders not aware of what is happening?

I will return to that point at the end of my remarks.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has said, some discussion on this topic happened at the informal meeting of the EU 27.  The first matter discussed at the European Council was migration.  I would like to refer specifically to the perilous situation facing many unaccompanied minors.  We have talked about that many times in this House.  Indeed, we passed a cross-party motion focusing on the situation then obtaining in Calais in November.  On 14 December, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, informed the House that she was bringing a memorandum to Government before Christmas on the issue of unaccompanied minors to establish a project office within Tusla to ensure that the commitment made by the House in the cross-party motion would be properly met.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen media reports from earlier this month suggesting that the Cabinet did discuss this matter on 10 January.  The House should now receive an update on exactly what progress the Government has made on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500025#X00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1485356700,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy mean in respect of the commitment regarding Calais?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500025#X00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1485356700,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Yes, the cross-party decision we made and the debate we had on the cross-party motion last November.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council's conclusions stated that member states should further intensify their efforts to accelerate the relocation of unaccompanied minors in particular.  As a signatory to that statement, it is important for the Taoiseach to work to ensure that Ireland leads in this area.  That is the will of the people of Ireland and certainly the will as expressed in this House.<\/p>  <p>  I do not propose to dwell on this issue but I note the agreement at the European Council to revise the Schengen borders code.  While Ireland clearly remains outside Schengen - which is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future - it would be useful, in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate, if the Taoiseach could keep us briefed on developments regarding Schengen.<\/p>  <p>  In dealing with security matters, the Council also invited the European Commission to make proposals for the establishment of a European defence fund.  This is an area in respect of Ireland needs to be alert.  First and foremost, as the Taoiseach indicated, the neutrality of our nation should not be brought into question.  I hope that the long-established Irish policy on neutrality will be constantly reinforced as has been the case up to now.<\/p>  <p>  Second, a debate around defence spending affords Ireland an opportunity to argue for greater investment in infrastructure.  That was something we did previously.  The Taoiseach will recall that when eastern countries were anxious for defence spending to be excluded from the terms of the evaluation of commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland and a number of other member states argued that vital infrastructure should be treated in a similar fashion.  In that way, when we have the capacity and money is cheap, we can invest in the roads, schools, hospitals and broadband that are vital for our economic development.  On foot of a proposal I put forward, the Party of European Socialists has established a network of economic experts to propose such changes to the Stability and Growth Pact.  My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, raised this issue with Commissioner Moscovici yesterday.  However, there is also a need for the Taoiseach to raise it at European Council level.  The desire of central European countries to increase defence spending is understandable at the moment, particularly in light of the peculiarly aggressive stance being taken by Russia.  From Ireland's perspective, however, it also gives us the opportunity to put forward our views on infrastructural spending.<\/p>  <p>  The conclusions on youth issues are easily the most disappointing aspect of the published conclusions.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach could inform the House as to whether the discussion was in any way more detailed than the conclusions infer.  The conclusions simply state that work relating to young people should continue.  Naturally, such work should continue but that does not indicate any ambition.  Ireland and its EU partners have a requirement to deal with issues such as apprenticeships, employment, access to third-level education and combating youth unemployment.  The Council does not seem to see any need for work to be stepped up on this, but that is not the Taoiseach's view or that of the House.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Council discussed Syria.  It appears that advocates for peace have now been reduced to crying out when atrocities occur.  The European Council did so again.  More than 300,000 people have been killed since the uprising began in March 2011.  During the intervening period, 11 million people - twice the population of this island - have been displaced and left homeless.  In many instances, they now find themselves many miles from home.  I visited Syrian refugee camps on border between Syrian and Jordan.  I saw people who previously had a standard of living exactly like ours suddenly reduced to nothing.  They fled for their lives with nothing, which is pitiable.  Talks have taken place in recent days in Astana, but very little seems to have come from them.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, a nationwide ceasefire has been in effect since the end of last year.  From media reports, however, it appears that ceasefire is under stress.  Air strikes and clashes have been reported on several battlefronts, particularly in the Wadi Barada region to the north west of Damascus.  Of course, Islamic State and other groups are not part of any ceasefire arrangement.  Any respite is welcome, but we need to find ways to ensure that the Council's conclusion that hostilities in Syria must cease immediately becomes not simply an aspiration but a reality.<\/p>  <p>  In addressing foreign affairs matters, it would be remiss of me not to ask the Taoiseach to make some direct comment about the situation facing Ibrahim Halawa.  As the Taoiseach is aware, a cross-party group travelled to Egypt two weeks ago to meet Ibrahim and step up our national efforts to secure his release.  We came home with expectations that progress could be hoped for but his trial, although formally commenced, is making very slow progress.  I invite the Taoiseach to advise us on whether he believes that some intervention by him at European Council level might advance Mr. Halawa's cause.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I noted how strange it was to read the conclusions of the European Council meeting and discover that Brexit was not mentioned at the formal meeting of the EU 28.  At the informal meeting of the EU 27, at least some discussion happened in the absence of the United Kingdom.  I am concerned that the conclusions of the informal meeting make no reference whatsoever to Ireland.  I will continue to press the Taoiseach on this matter in order to provide the sort of updates I have sought.  I welcome the initiative announced by the Taoiseach.  I hope that when there are more substantial issues, as was requested, we will not simply be having ten-minute statements.  We should have a meaty debate on it with questions and answers.  That would be really important.<\/p>  <p>  The annexe which defines the procedural arrangements for the negotiations around Article 50 makes clear that a dedicated working party with a permanent chair will oversee the negotiations between meetings of the European Council, and will provide guidance with Michel Barnier and his team.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach might confirm whether Ireland has secured membership of this working party; as the most affected country, we really need to be on it.  If possible, we might seek to chair it.  I do not want to mention any names but we can think of very distinguished former European officials at the highest level who would be seen as acceptable for the role across the European Union.  It is something we should advocate.<\/p> <p> We might hope the very hard Brexit now being advocated by the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom could have some of its corners rounded off in the Parliament, although that may be an optimistic view.  Unfortunately, the court has decided the devolved assemblies should not be involved in a direct mandate of the negotiating position in the United Kingdom.  In that context, it becomes all the more important for the unique circumstances facing all of the people of this island to be explicitly acknowledged in the position to be adopted by the European Union and for us to have clear inroads into ensuring the unique position of the people on this island will be properly represented in the position of the 27 EU member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500025#X00400","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485357300,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I begin by alluding to the most significant political event in recent months, which, bizarrely, did not feature much at the meeting of the European Council but which on a number of levels is already having a direct impact on political events in this continent.  The outcome of the US presidential election has brought into sharp focus the scale of the political crisis facing the capitalist establishment internationally.  Trump is clearly a racist, misogynist, multi-billionaire bigot but he is not trusted or supported by large sections of the ruling class in the US, including important sections of the Republican Party in the recent election.  Such opposition flows from the economic policies Trump has advocated.  His sexism and disgusting attacks on migrants and other minorities were a factor in helping to galvanise support for his candidacy but it was ultimately his opposition to policies of globalisation in the form of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, along with his promise to \"make America great again\" that ensured he was able to gain support in the so-called rust belt of the United States.  These states are made up of de-industrialised communities in places like Michigan, Ohio etc., whose manufacturing jobs have been destroyed by globalisation and neoliberal capitalism over the past four decades.  The Minister of State might want to pay attention to some of these points.  By cynically posing as an anti-establishment candidate opposed to the economic orthodoxy that has brought so much misery to working-class people, Mr. Trump was able to tap into the anger and hatred that exists towards the political establishment in the United States, epitomised by Ms Hillary Clinton.<\/p>  <p>  How do the factors that led to his election relate to Europe and the phenomenon of right-wing populism on this side of the Atlantic?  Trump's election has given confidence and an impetus to the forces of racist and right-wing populism here in Europe, in countries such as France, the Netherlands and Germany, where elections will take place later this year.  Last December, the far-right Freedom Party in Austria was able to gain 46% of the vote in the re-run of that country's presidential election.  According to the commentariat of the capitalist media and press, these developments are illustrative of a shift to the right within society.  This superficial analysis fails to understand the economic and political circumstances that have given rise to this right-wing populism.  Like Trump, right wing and far-right populist forces such as Marine Le Pen and the National Front in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and the Alternative for Germany party have gained from the decline or collapse in support for the so-called political centre.<\/p>  <p>  The latter is comprised of the traditional parties of the capitalist class in Europe, which occupy a similar position to Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, along with the former social democratic parties, such as the SPD in Germany, PASOK in Greece, PSOE in Spain, the Dutch Social Democrats and the so-called socialist parties of Portugal and France, which are sister organisations of Ireland's Labour Party.  Many of these parties have been in power since 2008, when the economic crisis of capitalism came to fruition.  They all uniformly accept and helped to implement the logic of neoliberal capitalism, the driving down of wages and conditions, de-industrialisation and the dismantling of the welfare state so the profits of big business and banks could be maximised.  They are keen supporters of the increasingly discredited EU project.  It is also noteworthy that some of them have sought, through their actions and words, to stir up anti-refugee and anti-migrant sentiment that has played into the hands of the far right.<\/p>  <p>  The far-right groups have put forward a populist message of railing against the European Union and globalisation, as well as scapegoating refugees and migrants for the problems confronting working and middle-class people.  Le Pen, who is expected to go through to the second round of the French presidential election, has gained support in areas of France that suffered de-industrialisation and which, in turn, face high levels of unemployment.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing inevitable about the rise of the Trumps, the Le Pens, Geert Wilders and their ilk and there is massive potential to fill the gaping political vacuum with genuine left movements.  For example, in the United States the support garnered by Mr. Bernie Sanders is indicative of this.  His message of a political revolution against the billionaire class resonated with many of those who were ultimately to vote for Trump.  Although the right poses a real threat to workers, young people, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transexual and queer people, as well as people of colour, the rise of the right can be met with enormous opposition in the months and years ahead.  The magnificent women's protests we saw at the weekend are just an indication of what may be to come.  That is our sincere hope.<\/p>  <p>  This reaction to the politics of the far right can help to create the basis to build a political alternative that can ultimately defeat racism and the right.  The building of a powerful socialist left is of urgent necessity if the growth and support for right-wing and populist parties is to be cut across.  While taking a principled position in opposition to racism and racist immigration controls and in favour of the right of asylum, there is necessity to seize the wealth of the 1% and invest in decent jobs, homes and services for the 99%, migrant and non-migrant alike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500026#Y00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1485357300,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The next slot is for Independents 4 Change.

There is a need for a different economic model of which the European Union could be the driver.  Two recent reports from Oxfam have certainly highlighted tax injustices involving businesses, multinationals and corporations avoiding and evading tax.  It is the developing countries that are most vulnerable to the negative effects of these tax policies.  The more recent of the reports presents data on the distribution of global wealth, confirming that the poorest half of the global population has less wealth than was previously thought.  Eight billionaires - they are all men - have the same wealth as half of the world or 3.6 billion people.  This concentration in individual wealth drives poverty and inequality and the EU could play a vital role in such a different economic model by vigorously implementing measures to tackle tax avoidance.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD with the base erosion and profit sharing project and the EU Commission country-by-country reporting is certainly the foundation of progress but there is a need to go further.  We must accept the requirement for all multinational companies to publicly publish the country-by-country reports for each country in which they operate.  Such publications would certainly send out a message on tax avoidance, shell companies and tax havens.<\/p><p> My second points relates to Palestine.  Before Christmas, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for the building of settlements to stop.  A 2003 resolution also called for a freeze on all settlement activity, but what we have seen since then is an increase.  This week we learned that a further 2,500 buildings or homes are going to be constructed.  All of this is being done with blatant disregard for international law, including international humanitarian law.  It is futile to pass resolutions that are simply ignored.  This matter is going off the agenda of the EU.<\/p> <p> I have been critical of certain aspects of the foreign policy of the former US President, Mr. Obama, but he made progress with Cuba by restoring more normalised relations.  His visit there helped to open up travel.  Many European countries have diplomatic relations with Cuba but we do not hear a combined collective European voice on the devastating effects of the embargo and its continuation.  The President, Mr. Higgins, is going there in February.  That could be an opportunity for Ireland to send a trade mission to Cuba.  We could see to what that might lead.<\/p> <p> The situation in Turkey is critical.  We have seen the complete undermining of democracy and the right to peaceful protest there.  This is all part of an anti-Kurdish agenda.  Turkey has signed the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Charter of Local Self-Government but it is blatantly flouting those laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500026#Y00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485357900,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I echo the points made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in respect of the settlements in Palestine.  The activities of the Israelis are absolutely reprehensible.<\/p>  <p>  My main comment relates to the refugee issue.  I welcome the fact that the last European Council agreed that member states had to increase their relocation pledges according to allocation and that from December the Council would seek to have a pledge on a monthly basis.  I would welcome that arrangement and it is something we could monitor more closely.  I was glad to hear Tusla had three social workers in France last week.  They were there to try to activate the pledge made by this House to take 200 unaccompanied minors from the camps.  Those minors had been displaced through the routing of the Calais camp and so on.  Although I welcome the move, it is not clear whether sufficient resources are being made available to the social work teams in place to facilitate these unaccompanied minors who have been displaced in France as well as the more normal ones, for want of a better term.<\/p>  <p>  Only 520 refugees arrived in Ireland last year under the resettlement programme.  Moreover, only 240 refugees were relocated here from Greece and Italy under the relocation programme.  Let us put that in perspective.  In the first two weeks of this year, 219 refugees died while trying to cross the Mediterranean to get to Europe.  They died because of Europe's deadly border policies.  They died because of the walls being built in Slovenia, Greece, Bulgaria and Hungary.  Those walls are being built to prevent people fleeing conflict from taking safer land routes to get to Europe.  It is somewhat sickening to listen to the good European liberals cry bloody murder at Donald Trump's pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, especially since the European Union has encircled itself with walls in the past four years.  Let us not forget that.  The newly beefed up European border and coast guard, Frontex, had its inauguration last October.  It took place at a checkpoint in the middle of a border fence between Bulgaria and Turkey.  The fence was made of metal and razor wire and many people have died at that spot.  That event was reprehensible as well.<\/p>  <p>  The points made about Turkey at the meeting are concerning.  Of more concern is the shakiness of the rotten deal reached with Turkey in the first instance.  The deteriorating situation in Turkey means that tens of thousands of refugees are now trapped on Greek islands in overcrowded and dangerous conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The points made at the Council urging swift action to implement the EU-NATO joint declaration signed in December are also a matter of concern.  The declaration amounts to a hawkish commitment to a more militarised EU.  It would lead to more investment in arms and to the military working hand in glove with NATO, amplifying defence spending and so on.  This is completely incompatible with our position on neutrality.  We should be standing full square against it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500027#Z00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1485357900,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I listened to the opening statement from the Taoiseach.  He referred to war crimes in east Aleppo, and rightly so.  It was disappointing that he did not refer to the war crimes on the other side, because they have been committed on both sides.<\/p><p>It is probably not his fault and it was not discussed at the last meeting, but it is striking how the EU has been so tolerant of what Israel is doing to Palestine.  The purely symbolic UN Security Council Resolution 2334, passed at the end of December, is unenforceable.  It was simply another parting gift from Obama to the world as he hurries to buy back his conscience following eight years of a blood-drenched US Presidency. In keeping with Obama's toothless stance on Israel, the US abstained from the vote.  The 430,000 Jewish settlers currently living in the West Bank will stay there, as will the 200,000 in east Jerusalem.  No one on the UN Security Council will do anything about them or the planned expansion of illegal Jewish settlements.  On Sunday the Israeli Administration announced plans to build 566 new Jewish settler homes in east Jerusalem.  Yesterday it announced the approval of 2,500 new settlement homes in the West Bank.  It seems the increasingly ultra-racist and right-wing Israeli Administration is celebrating the departure of Obama and the arrival of Trump.  This is saying something, since Obama has given more military aid to Israel than any US President before him.  Furthermore, the USA was silent on the UN Security Council when the Israelis killed almost 600 children with US-made F-16 fighter jets and Apache helicopters using Hellfire missiles, in Gaza in 2014.<\/p><p>David Friedman, the new US ambassador to Israel, finances illegal settlements in the West Bank.  He has openly argued for the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.  Netanyahu's Administration is being increasingly populated by people even more hawkish than himself.  Robert Fisk has said, &quot;Netanyahu will soon be the most left-wing member of his increasingly racist government&quot;.  The two-state solution is obviously dead.  No one in the Israeli Government wants it.  Given the continuing expansion of illegal settlements, one third of Palestinians do not even believe that it is possible anymore, according to a recent poll.<\/p><p>Last year, the US gave the Israelis $38 billion dollars' worth of military aid.  It seems the US is about to drop all pretence of condemning Israeli colonisation and apartheid against Palestinians.  It seems the Israeli Administration will continue the policy of human rights violations against and absolute rule over the Palestinian people.  How long before the members of Hamas are provoked to defend themselves?  How long before we see another cleansing like the one in 2014?  That was an act of genocide.<\/p><p>It was interesting to read the column by Alan Shatter in the <i>Irish Times<\/i>today.  He called for international encouragement and confidence-building measures between parties.  People have been saying the same kind of things since the Oslo agreement over 20 years ago.  During that time, the West Bank settler population has grown from 109,000 to almost 400,000.  At this stage, 40% of adult male Palestinians and thousands of children there have seen the insides of Israeli jails and prisons.  Many remain there without charge.<\/p><p>Ireland must stop selling arms to Israel under the dual-use banner.  Ireland and the EU should openly and harshly condemn the illegal expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands as well as the ongoing human rights abuses against Palestinians.  Ireland should take part directly in the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement.  The time for encouragement is long past: the Israeli Government is the obstacle to peace.<\/p><p>Why does the Government not encourage and pressurise the EU to take a human rights position in respect of how Israel is behaving towards Palestine?  I cannot for the life of me understand that.  This is one of the most deplorable atrocities on the planet today.  It is at the source of so many problems in the region.

Those involved are risking their lives in this great humanitarian mission.  I salute all the NGOs, including M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  I salute all those involved who are so concerned and anxious about what is happening there.  I have seen it beamed on our television screens.  I saw a documentary recently and I compliment those who made it.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is very important because one has to see it.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  In recent parliamentary questions, I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade if he raised at European Council level the issue of the genocide and persecution of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East.  In that I include minority Muslim religions as well because they are being fiercely persecuted, as indeed are the Yazidi tribe.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, assured me that Ireland has repeatedly addressed the question of the protection of Christians and other religious minorities in Syria and Iraq in particular in meetings and engagements at both the EU and the UN.  I have no doubt that he has.  I salute him for that and thank him.<\/p> <p> The Minister also mentioned that Ireland has raised our concerns over the protection of minority populations, including Christians, at the UN Human Rights Council.  I have no doubt that he has.  However, I am appalled that the persecution and total wipeout of Christianity, and indeed any groups, no matter who they are, whether Christian, a Muslim minority, the Yazidi tribe, the Kurds previously or any other group, that do not agree with the very strong and powerful Muslim group, has been going on for so long now.  I do not know why the international community has not taken some steps against this.<\/p> <p> Deputy Wallace was critical of the US for different reasons.  There were the invasions by the Americans and the other allies.  They bombed the hell out of the place.  Before that happened, under Saddam, Gaddafi and the other rulers, even in Syria, the Christians were allowed to practice.  I have gone out to Lebanon and met refugees and the head of the Coptic Church.  I spent three days there with Deputy Grealish and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  We visited the camps.  They told us that while they did not have impunity, they did have total freedom to practise their religions, whatever beliefs they were, under those appalling regimes, as we knew they were and as they were in many other areas.  Now, those groups are totally persecuted.  Any protections they had have been diminished greatly and they are being obliterated.<\/p> <p> I spent three days during each of the last three summers in Rome at an international conference with colleagues from the Oireachtas.  When we met the Holy Father and presented our position paper to him, he appealed to us to go back to our parliaments and raise this issue.  It is a massive issue that he has been desperately concerned about.  We did not even have a meaningful debate about it in this Parliament, despite my trying to raise it numerous times with the Taoiseach and the Ministers of the previous and current Governments.  Deputy Grealish and I are forced at this stage to submit a Topical Issue matter about the persecution of Christians as this is the only way I can get a debate on it in the House.  I am certainly not diminishing the persecution of the other groups as well.  I am extremely concerned at the lethargy and the blind eye being turned to what is going on.  It is going to destabilise the whole world.  They have been there for centuries and they are now being slaughtered, tortured and wiped out.  If they do not convert to Islam within 24 hours or leave, they are mercilessly executed.  The people I met in the camps were only old grannies, women or young children under the age of ten, in many cases.  It is sad that all the rest of the men and young women were either murdered or gone to fight in the war.  That is not a good situation.<\/p> <p> We should be doing much more in the EU.  I saluted the Naval Service and that, but that is only intervening at the very last moment.  The refugees are so desperate to escape the persecution, they will get on to those dinghies and other makeshift boats knowing the dangers of it.  I have asked them why they would ever contemplate doing that, as it is such a risk.  They said that it would be far easier an option to drown in the sea than to be slaughtered, persecuted and tortured.  For people with intelligence to be driven to going on those overcrowded boats, with the extortion, the money racket, the smuggling and the many children and babies that have been lost, it is just horrific.  The torture at home is just too much for them.

I ask the Minister of State to pass that on to the Taoiseach and to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.<\/p>  <p>  On another matter entirely, I would like to raise the issue of Brexit and the effect and impact it will have on Irish agriculture.  It will be devastating.  After Prime Minister May's speech last week, we were told this and that.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what support we are receiving from our so-called European partners on this matter?  We are in a very awkward situation with the land Border between Northern Ireland and ourselves and how we are placed geographically beside our nearest traders, Great Britain.  If it pulls out, we will surely have a special position.  We must surely have that recognised.  God knows we have been good enough Europeans and good enough lapdogs to go over to Ms Merkel.  She says, \"Jump\", and we say, \"How high?\"<\/p>  <p>  We saw what happened with the banking crisis when the Europeans shovelled in the money when are our banks were bust.  The bondholders and everyone else got off scot free.  It is surely payback time now.  We have had many hours of need, but this is one.  It is a total imponderable.  We do not know what the impact will be.  We have a fair idea of the impact because of the figures from the trade we do with England.  Prime Minister May has refused to address any Deputies or take questions from them.  I suppose she is dead right, she is a sovereign leader.  Britain is going to look after itself.  We are going to be the poor relation off the coast of Europe that is left behind unless we stand up, act up, man and woman up and challenge the EU that we have a right to a place.<\/p>  <p>  We have been good Europeans since 1973.  I campaigned at that time as a young boy with my family.  So much has changed.  We have seen the cause of Brexit.  It is because there is so much regulation and such an uncaring attitude from the powerful nations in Europe.  We are kind of seen as the poor relation.  This is going to prove it.  The EU has the chance and opportunity now to give us special status and to try to soften the hard Brexit.  The thought of a hard Border is awful.  I travelled during the summer between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  A motorway was built between them.  I saw the hard border there.  There were lines of traffic and queues.  The bus driver resorted to bribery to get through quickly.  All 52 passports on the bus were looked for before we were let through.  Are we going to face that land Border in Newry, Aughnacloy and many more places like that?  That cannot happen.  We cannot go back to that.  It is too awful to go back to it.  We saw what happened the other night in Belfast and what can happen.  We saw how near to that we are.<\/p>  <p>  We have a very special relationship within the EU.  We have a special relationship with our nearest neighbours in England and in Northern Ireland.  One day, I hope it will all be the one country.  I am surprised at the way some of the people voted, but that is how they did vote.  We need special treatment for this.  We are not going to get it unless we ask for it, shout about it and go over and demand it.  We cannot be saying it softly, softly, as we have been, because the EU is not listening.  They are not good listeners anyway.  They have to listen to us now, or we will have to look at other options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500028#AA00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1485358500,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity, on foot of reviewing the European Council meeting in December, to discuss some of the wider and bigger issues that are happening in our world, particularly the issues of security, migration, and the accession of new countries into the EU, which I understand was one of the main items up for discussion at the meeting.  Many of my thoughts in this regard are informed by our own recent Oireachtas visit to Cairo.  As well as raising the case of Mr. Ibrahim Halawa and the need for his return home to Dublin, the whole experience gave us the opportunity to gain a wider understanding of what is happening in the Middle East and near the south and south-east borders of the EU.<\/p><p>More than anything else I was drawn to the meeting we had with the Secretary General of the Arab League.  It was a two-hour discussion that was hugely informative and interesting.  It backs up some of the analysis that this Parliament has had with regard to what has happened in the Middle East over the last number of decades and, picking up on the points made by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace, the issue of Palestine was centre stage.  It was a reflection of the Irish position and the Secretary General at the time said that Ireland was different.  He said that we had taken a position over the years in support of the Palestinian people that is recognised and important.  At that critical time in south Lebanon when local populations were threatened by militias following an Israeli invasion he recalled the fact that the Irish UN soldiers held the line.  The soldiers had said \"Stop, you shall not go further\".  The Secretary General compared that to what had happened at Srebrenica and other locations where the UN had not held the line.  Ireland has a very proud and a very important record with our troops still in Lebanon, the Golan Heights and elsewhere.  It copperfastened in my own mind - the Secretary General of the Arab League set it out in very clear terms - the roles of some other European countries.  The invasion of Iraq left a country destroyed without any institutions and with a vacuum that was filled by the likes of ISIS.  In Libya in recent years, French, British and American bombing had left the country similarly completely destabilised without any institutions.  All the 25 year olds there now have Kalashnikovs in their hands and 600,000 people are waiting to use that place in a vacuum as a jumping-off point to Europe.  The point was reiterated that Ireland should continue with a really strong position of neutrality and should not go down the road of an aggressive European intervention - as done by some countries - in our neighbouring areas because it does not work.  Our approach of supporting United Nations missions and maintaining a neutrality is hugely important and it was copperfastened from that visit.<\/p> <p> Following that visit to Cairo I was very fortunate to be able to proceed on to visit Turkey.  I was with some NGOs visiting refugee camps on the Turkey-Syria border.  We went right up to the border town of Reyhanli and Antakya, which is a city near the Syrian border.  That visit also informs me with regard to the main item on the European Council on what are the dealings and relationships with Turkey and where is the accession process going.  The Green Party condemned the clampdown in Turkey last year with the imprisonment of some 40,000 people following the coup and the imprisonment of people who work in the media, which we must stand up against.  If, however, we simply demonise Turkey and see ourselves retreating back to Christendom with a hard border with any of the neighbours to the east and south, I do not believe that would work for the EU, Turkey or the whole wider region.  If one looks at the history of Turkey's attempt at accession to the European Union - stretching back to 1987 - and especially the actions of countries such as Austria and France when it came to the crunch in the middle of the last decade, we basically welched on any deals and stepped back.  The EU said that it would not progress the process.  That, more than anything else, may have undermined the development of democratic and other systems that were advancing within Turkey.  We should be very careful in going towards a divided world, particularly where the EU develops these hard borders with Turkey and other countries.  The EU should, through influence and diplomatic relations, be looking to try to address whatever human rights or other issues arise in neighbouring countries but should do so with a view to long-term co-operation.  In this world, we cannot manage migration or security just by going back to a fortress Europe approach.<\/p> <p> From personal experience in visiting the camps and speaking with NGOs in these areas, we should be slightly careful about depicting as brilliant our treatment of migrants and refugees.  I believe those refugees on the Greek islands, in the port town of Piraeus, in Scaramanga outside Athens and in Thessaloniki are, in many cases, in much worse conditions than the 2.7 million people who have been assimilated into Turkey after coming out of the Syrian crisis.  It is not ideal; there are incredibly difficult circumstances and one would like to see better services and provisions.  I am not too sure, however, that we in Europe can say how poorly Turkey has managed the situation when it has taken in 2.7 million, while we are leaving some 50,000 people stranded in the Greek islands and refugee camps.  They are living under nothing but a basic tent in one of the coldest winters in that region in a long time.<\/p> <p> I know this situation is far distant from us.  It is as far from our borders as could be but in our engagement there is a responsibility on us, and on the particular voice Ireland has in Europe, which is one that stands up for a neutral non-militaristic solution or approach to these divisions in the world.  We should be using that voice to try to create an environment of co-operation rather than the division that is increasingly happening in this time.<\/p> <p> I read the Council's conclusions and the Taoiseach's speech with interest.  It seems that Ireland has not taken a particularly strong position on the issue of the shutting down of the accession talks for Turkey at the present time.  I believe Ireland should be willing to be international if we are aiming to take a place on the UN Security Council in the early part of the next decade.  If we are to garner support for that role it behoves us to be internationalist in our thinking.  Ireland benefits hugely as part of a globalised trading system.  Most of the large international companies with offices based in Ireland set up their Europe, Middle East and Africa offices here.  It behoves us to take the benefits of that - as we are doing - but to apply it in a responsible foreign policy that sees us taking a slightly different tack to some of our nearest neighbours, especially as Brexit occurs and as Britain takes a completely different stance and does not align with whatever the European Union is doing.  That is all the more reason for us to put our resources into that.<\/p> <p> One recommendation from the Secretary General of the Arab League was that we should be visiting those countries on a much more regular basis if we do aim to try to take that role in the UN Security Council.  While it is not easy - and I know all of our time is very short and there is a whole range of different pressing issues - I believe Ireland should be looking to send further parliamentary delegations to visit Turkey or other countries in the Middle East, which is currently on fire.  That allocation of resources, while it is a long-term investment, would be significant and important for the State.  By visiting, talking and listening and by adapting that neutral, non-aligned, diplomatic approach, Ireland has a particular and specific role to play in Palestine and in Syria.  It is ridiculous that we have a Syrian peace process that is now being managed by Russia, Turkey and Iran and that the European Union seems to have abdicated its position, other than supporting the occasional drone strike from the US and others.  This is the wrong approach.  We will not solve the threat of ISIS, no matter what President Trump thinks, by bombing people from a distance in a way that is just as terrifying as the bombing attacks that occur in our areas.  We in the EU have a responsibility to expand the whole philosophy of peaceful, democratic collaboration, human rights and rule of law.  This is done by talking with people and working with people; not by setting up further barriers or creating further tensions by the construction of walls, the use of drone strikes and other military means.  That is not our way and we should stand up for the alternative approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500028#AA00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485359100,"counter":281,"content":"<p>There will be an opportunity for questions and answers, after which the Minister of State will have five minutes to wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500029#BB00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1485359100,"counter":282,"content":"<p>In the last few days we have seen the importance that the Parliament in Britain will have in the Brexit process and in the triggering of Article 50.

According to newspaper reports, Ireland is not, Mr. Hogan said, prepared for the Brexit challenge.  He questioned whether Ireland is doing enough in the face of the mammoth challenge facing us.  Ireland, the Commissioner stated, should be allocating more resources to Brussels ahead of the triggering of Article 50 and there must be a greater urgency in Dublin to reflect the fact that once the British trigger that article, the centre of power and influence will move from London to Brussels.  The deal will be done in Brussels and that is where Ireland's strategic focus must be.  Will the Minister of State give an assurance that we are dealing with that crucial aspect of the problem?  It has been revealed that the Taoiseach has met only six of the 27 EU Heads of Government.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin mentioned the need to build coalitions.

I absolutely assure the Deputy that we are completely aware of the importance of Brussels in these discussions.  We are in daily contact with our permanent representative to the EU, Mr. Declan Kelleher, who requested and was given additional resources to ensure Ireland's key strategic interests with regard to Brexit are addressed.  No country in the Union has given the level of attention to the issues pertaining to and arising out of Brexit that Ireland has given.  That includes the United Kingdom.  Our engagement on the matter commenced in advance of the referendum when a strategic unit was put in place in the Department of the Taoiseach to monitor the campaign and see how we could engage in a limited way, as a separate sovereign nation, and make known the potential implications for our country of the departure of the UK from the Union.  We are not happy with the result of the referendum but we respect the decision of the people of the UK.  Our engagement has very much been ramped up in many different formats, especially through our permanent representative in Brussels but also here in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of Brexit is not on the agenda of Departments; it is at the top of the agenda of most of them.  In the case of the critically important Departments, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the most senior personnel are engaged on issues relating to Brexit.  The same is the case in the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That work is co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure a whole-of-government approach.  We all in this House have a role to play through our different groupings within the European Parliament to ensure a co-ordinated view of the issues that are important to our country is heeded in a European context.  There are two separate challenges facing us in this regard.  We have been very successful in addressing the first challenge, which is the need to identify the peace process and the common travel area as unique elements of the Brexit process that pertain only to the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  In that context, we welcomed the commitment given by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, in her statement last week.  We have succeeded in making the point that those two issues relate only to our islands and are working to come up with a separate and unique solution to both of them.<\/p>  <p>  The second challenge we are facing relates to trade, which is something that affects all 27 of the member states remaining in the Union.  We will, of course, be more affected by Brexit than many other member states, but we are not uniquely affected.  That is why we must, on the one hand, build strong alliances with countries broadly in the north west of Europe, albeit on the other side of Britain, while remaining aware that when it comes to trade, other countries are competing with us for trade into the UK market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500030#CC00200","speaker":"1282"},{"type":"speech","time":1485359700,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Ibrahim Halawa's case was referred to by several speakers.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, is just joining me.  This has been the issue most raised by the Minister over recent years.  While we welcome that the trial is ongoing, Deputy Crowe's initial question was asked when the Taoiseach was present and the Taoiseach asked me to inform the Deputy that he has twice raised the matter directly with the Egyptian premier.  Given the attendance of the Ceann Comhairle and representatives of the D&aacute;il, it is an area where we have shared concerns.  As I say, the court case is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to Deputy Crowe's question on the unification of Cyprus, I have been present at meetings involving both Turkish and, more particularly, Cypriot representatives.  We must really wish them the very best.  Their discussions are proceeding in a positive light.  It is clearly a matter for dialogue and discussion between Cyprus and Turkey.

The envoy has an extremely difficult and challenging task.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to Deputy Crowe's question on Turkey, the Irish Government position is in line with the position as articulated by Deputy Ryan.  It is, of course, accurate to state that there are issues which give cause for significant concern for the European Union and for the democratic values we hold, especially with respect to the rule of law, the freedom of opposition and the freedom of the press.  The European Parliament has taken a different position from the one taken by the European Council.  The European Council's position, which is supported by the Irish Government, is that we must continue to allow a pathway towards the European Union to countries in our neighbourhood because that pathway will encourage - to be blunt, force - these countries to adopt the fundamental principles of democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law that we hold dear.  I agree that for us to close off that option would not be in the best interests of the opposition in Turkey or the people of Turkey generally.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans for a European Union army.

With respect to trade and the importance of the UK market <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>markets globally, I want to give some statistics about Irish goods exports.  The Republic of Ireland exports 11% of its goods to the United Kingdom, but we export 40% of our goods to the rest of the European Union.  We export 49% of our goods to the rest of the world, with which we trade on the basis of our membership of the European Union.  Essentially, there is an 89% trading relationship on the basis of our European relationship as against 11% with the United Kingdom.  Our United Kingdom relationship is clearly important but significantly less, at approximately 11% of the total.  With respect to services, our dependence on the UK market is greater.  Nineteen per cent of our services exports go into the United Kingdom, but 35% go the rest of the European Union and a further 46% go to the rest of the world.<\/p><p>Again, there is an 81% dependence on the rest of the world, so it is vital to be clear that while the trade negotiations with respect to our relationship with the United Kingdom will be critically important to this island, our relationship with the European Union and the rest of the world is of significantly greater importance to us.<\/p> <p> A question was asked about Schengen and ongoing developments.  We will provide a briefing on that.<\/p> <p> The issue of Irish neutrality is not up for debate.  Obviously, through the Lisbon treaty our long-known position on neutrality is robust.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin asked about the project office for unaccompanied minors from Calais.  This has been established within the last month in Tusla and the assessment process for Calais has commenced.  The Deputy also referred to a working group within the Council.  I will clarify this because his definition of it was not quite right.  There will be a working group of officials from all member states.  It will be the officials who are based in Brussels and they will report to our ambassador through COREPER.  It will be chaired by an official and the Commission will also report to it regularly.  The most important point to emphasise is that the oversight and the mandate for negotiations will come from the European Council.<\/p> <p> I will address the issue of Ukraine and the Netherlands.  The agreement was finalised in 2014 but was not ratified by member states.  Members will be aware that a referendum took place in the Netherlands which rejected the agreement, so a protocol was sought by the Dutch Government.  The European Council reached a decision at the December Council meeting that will be binding on all 28 member states.  It addresses the concerns of the Dutch Government and we understand that the Dutch Government will now proceed to ratify the agreement.<\/p> <p> Russia was again discussed at the European Council.  The French and Germans provided an update on the Minsk peace agreements relating to Ukraine.  Given the lack of progress in implementing the Minsk accords, it was rightly agreed that sanctions on Russia should be renewed for a further six months.<\/p> <p> Regarding economic and social development and youth, the Prime Ministers noted the decision by the Ministers for Finance to extend the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI.  The Council also noted the modernisation of trade defence instruments and discussed energy union, the Youth Guarantee, the youth employment initiative, the European Solidarity Corps and, of significant importance from an Irish point of view, the digital Single Market in the context of the Single Market.  The European Council welcomed the agreement of Finance Ministers to strengthen and extend the European Fund for Strategic Investments, with an ambition to have this agreed with the European Parliament this year.  It is fair to say that the impact of the EFSI in Ireland remains modest, but we support further development of what is a key block of the European investment plan.  We welcome that the new office for the European Investment Bank has been opened in Dublin.  This should provide further complementary support for project development in this country.

In this context, she made clear that her priorities include maintaining the common travel area and avoiding a return to a hard Border with Northern Ireland, both of which are welcome.<\/p>  <p>  The Government notes that the British approach is now firmly that of a country which will have left the EU but which seeks to negotiate a new, close relationship with the Union.  The analysis across Government has covered all possible models for the future UK relationship with the EU.<\/p>  <p>  When the negotiations start later in the spring, we, together with our EU partners, will face the UK across the negotiating table and will strive for a deal that everyone can accept but, more importantly, that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests.  It will not be easy but we are prepared.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of our preparations for this process, I have carried out a round of contacts with all of my EU counterparts to make them aware of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island, a process to which the EU has already made a key and substantial contribution.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has met with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and other EU Heads of Government to convey Ireland&rsquo;s concerns.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I also met with the Commission&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, here in Dublin last October.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is encouraged at the extent to which our concerns are understood and appreciated by our partners and by the universal desire to assist in addressing them satisfactorily.  Commissioner Barnier&rsquo;s clear statement in December that Irish issues would be a negotiating priority was very positive. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is talking to the UK and working closely with the Commission and Council secretariat to develop concrete solutions to the issues raised and to work out how these can be achieved in the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and the British Government have reaffirmed that the Good Friday Agreement is the indispensable foundation for all engagement on Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>While this provides much needed reassurance, we are under no illusions about the hard work needed to deliver it.<\/p> <p> In advance of the commencement of negotiations, the Government's engagement is being intensified in 2017.  Our embassy network across the European Union is being fully deployed in support of the process, which will be assisted by the allocation of additional resources to our permanent representation in Brussels and our embassies in London, Paris and Berlin.  The first plenary session of the all-island civic dialogue was held on 2 November and the process is continuing.  The next plenary session will take place on 17 February.  Between these two plenary meetings, 14 sectoral events involving various Government Ministers and examining specific policy areas in greater detail will also have taken place.  The work of the civic dialogue process has reaffirmed the priority issues identified by the Government.<\/p> <p> I assure the House that the Government will continue to prepare comprehensively and proactively for all dimensions of the EU-UK negotiations in pursuit of our priority concerns.

The House will be aware that dealing with the legacy of the past relating to the conflict in Northern Ireland is a major priority for me as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for my Government colleagues.  This commitment is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which makes specific reference to pursuing the issue of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  The all-party motion on the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed directly to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to pursuing actively the implementation of these all-party motions and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the issue on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, most recently at our meeting in Belfast on 19 January, just last week.  In our discussions, I advised the Secretary of State that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documentation is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is a matter of deep concern to the Government and the House.  I emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case.  He indicated the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way that would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British authorities, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House on a cross-party basis.<\/p>  <p>  There are many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.

I have unreservedly condemned all deliberate targeting of civilians and have urged all parties to this conflict to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law.<\/p>  <p>  Together with the Minister of State for the diaspora and international development, Deputy Joe McHugh, I recently announced that Ireland will provide a further &euro;2 million in humanitarian funding to meet urgent needs in Yemen resulting from the civil war that has intensified since March 2015.  The donation of &euro;2 million brings our total humanitarian funding for those affected by the conflict to more than &euro;4 million since the beginning of 2016.  This will be issued through the UN, trusted NGOs on the ground and the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC.<\/p>  <p>  I met the president of the ICRC, Peter Maurer, in Dublin in November, during which time he told me his organisation is grateful for the continued and solid support of the Irish people.  We share many of the ICRC's policy approaches with regard to matters of disarmament.  It is critically important that the International Committee of the Red Cross remain an important humanitarian partner for Ireland, operating as it does in some of the most difficult and challenging environments across the world, including Yemen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500037#KK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1485363900,"counter":366,"content":"<p>We have diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia and conduct trade with it.

Ireland has consistently been very clear in all discussions on the EU's response to the migration crisis that addressing these root causes is essential and that the actions which the EU takes, using instruments which are funded primarily from development budgets, must be used for development and humanitarian activities.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions within the EU and with the priority countries as outlined are continuing, and a progress report was presented by the European Commission to the European Parliament, European Council and the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016.

This would be a matter of real concern but it remains to be seen what actually happens.  Previous US presidents have signalled the same intention but in office have recognised the difficulties such a move could cause.  It would be likely to be seen as most provocative across the Arab world and in particular in Palestinian east Jerusalem.  It should be recalled that there have been repeated calls in recent years, including by the United States as a member of the Quartet, to avoid destabilising actions in Jerusalem in view of the sharply-rising tensions there.  The position for diplomatic missions in Israel is governed by UN Security Council Resolution 478 from 1980, which called on all UN member states with diplomatic missions in Jerusalem to \"withdraw such missions from the Holy City\".  Ireland&rsquo;s embassy was established in Tel Aviv subsequent to that resolution.<\/p>  <p>  The status of Jerusalem is one of the major \"final status issues\" to be decided as part of a comprehensive peace deal between Israel and its Arab and Palestinian neighbours.  Israel claims all of the greater Jerusalem area as its capital and not just the area of west Jerusalem that lies within Israel.  Ireland and the international community as a whole envisage Jerusalem as the location of the capitals of both Israel and a state of Palestine.  We look forward to establishing two embassies there in that context but to do so now, in advance of that comprehensive settlement, would be unhelpful for the reasons I have mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500040#NN00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1485365700,"counter":397,"content":"<p>That is a very lame response.  As a country and internationally we should be very concerned by the commitment from President Trump to move the embassy to east Jerusalem.  Within 48 hours of his inauguration, or even before the inauguration, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel stated there was no longer a need to co-ordinate construction in Jewish neighbourhoods in east Jerusalem and that Israel will build where it wants and as much as it wants.  I have a map in my office and I am sure other Deputies also have it.  It indicates the very drastic changes to the occupied areas of Palestine over the past few decades.  It is being encroached upon in a very serious way.  This action will both provoke and unleash major violent reactions in Palestine and Israel and will further destabilise the region.  Jordan has already warned that this will feed into the actions of Islamic fundamentalists and give them more fuel.  That is why we must be concerned about it.

A total of 830 Dublin Fire Brigade firefighters are also trained paramedics.  They are available to provide immediate emergency medical assistance and the benefits of this integrated service should not be underestimated.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Fire Brigade has been providing the ambulance service in the Dublin area since 1898.  Since that time, it has dealt with major emergencies in an efficient and professional manner including at the time of the North Strand bombings in 1941, the Dublin bombings in 1974, the Stardust fire in 1981 and the fatal bus accident on Wellington Quay in 2004.  Dubliners are rightly proud of their fire brigade and ambulance service and hold the service in great affection.<\/p>  <p>  There are indications that SIPTU and IMPACT will ballot Dublin Fire Brigade members for strike action over a failure to secure four additional and necessary ambulances for the service.  The chief executive of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, has stated that he wishes to see a transfer of all call taking and dispatching for ambulances to the national central control centre in Tallaght.  He has also stated that this has been agreed by the chief executives of the other Dublin local authorities and by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, three comprehensive reviews have been carried out relating to the ambulance service.

The independent Lightfoot review of the National Ambulance Service capacity was published.  It is clear from all three reports that co-ordination and integration between the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service is required.  In addition, there are deficits in ambulance capacity which require significant investment.<\/p> <p> Then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, informed the Seanad on 10 March 2015 that staff in the Dublin Fire Brigade would be fully consulted before any changes are implemented.  Clearly, such consultation has not taken place.  Dublin City Council recently passed a motion to the effect that the elected members in all the Dublin local authorities and on the regional assembly should be consulted about any proposed changes.  During the same debate on 10 March 2015, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, also clarified the position on statutory responsibility for the Dublin ambulance service.<\/p> <p> The expert panel on the pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin published its report in December 2015.  The findings of this expert panel should be implemented as a matter of urgency as this report provides a mechanism to address operational inefficiencies and the issue of a fully integrated ambulance service in the Dublin area.  The Minister should commence immediately, by way of the new governance arrangements set out by the expert panel, a process to eliminate the shortfall in the available capacity of the Dublin Fire Brigade to meet demand in order that the use of fire appliances to respond to ambulance calls is reserved for those calls that are clinically appropriate.<\/p> <p> Funding should be provided directly by the Department and Dublin City Council for the operation of the ambulance service provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade and this funding should be increased to reflect the current costs of the service.  The National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade should be given equal status and equal treatment regarding the operation of ambulance services in Dublin.  The current dispatch functions should be retained by the Dublin Fire Brigade and the Dublin Fire Brigade should maintain control over its own clinical governance.<\/p> <p> I understand that in the coming weeks the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will continue to engage with the HSE and Dublin City Council on any changes in service provision which may be proposed.  The findings of the expert panel on the pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin published in December 2015 provides a clear path to deal with problems identified in the various reviews carried out to date.  The chief executive of Dublin City Council, Mr. Owen Keegan, and the HSE must not be allowed to make changes unilaterally to the existing arrangements and they most certainly should consult the staff and the unions involved.

The capacity review, published last year, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  The review identified deficits in ambulance capacity, including in the Dublin area, which will require very significant investment to address.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  To this end, increased funding has been made available for ambulance services in the HSE national service plan 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA report on ambulance services, which was published in December 2014, highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The report identified concerns around the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes, and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  The HIQA report points very clearly to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area.  In that context, the HSE is working closely with Dublin City Council, which is leading on this issue on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities to devise and agree the elements of a safe, sustainable, integrated and quality ambulance service for the citizens of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health fully accepts that, in the interest of patient safety, we need the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service to have a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to service delivery.  To that end, discussions are taking place between officials of the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The Departments have requested a joint action plan from the HSE and Dublin City Council on service and governance issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin ambulance services review, which was commissioned in 2014, is focused on identifying a service model for the optimal provision of emergency ambulance services and patient care in the Dublin region, including service quality, patient safety and value for money.

As the saying goes, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  There are certainly problems that have to be addressed, but they can be addressed.<\/p><p>I want to come back to the issue of clinical governance.  The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, stated that it was the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as it was then, that had responsibility for the Dublin ambulance service.  Despite this, the Minister of State at the Department of Health is here this evening answering my questions and all my parliamentary questions were transferred to the Minister for Health.  We need clarity on that.  There are European court decisions in this regard which clearly state a role for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  I also want an assurance on consultation.  No consultation took place between the staff and the unions on the HSE and Dublin City Council review.  It is a recipe for disaster.  There must be consultation with the elected members, the staff involved and the trade unions before any changes are contemplated, and not as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  There must be consultation on this now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500042#PP00300","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1485366900,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that I will certainly bring his pleas to the relevant parties on the consultation.

The reality would have been lost in a lot of the hoopla, backslapping and self-congratulation that went on around the granting of medical cards to children under the age of six.  The unfortunate reality is that the failure to plan on the part of this Government and that which preceded it has now manifested itself.  In north county Dublin, it is quite a feature but especially so in the town of Balbriggan.  The latter has a very young population and we can expect to see a surge in the number of children under six in the next couple of years.<\/p>  <p>  By way of illustration, I will speak about a woman I know called Louise - we have the same name.  Louise is married and has three children, two of whom have special needs.  She can practically see a doctor's surgery from her home but her children and her family are registered with a doctor in Malahide.  Should her young children require the services of a GP, they must travel from Balbriggan to Malahide.  As they do so, they drive past dozens of doctors' surgeries.  The surgeries in Balbriggan are full to capacity.  It is not possible for a large number of parents such as Louise to be able to access those services because they are full to capacity.  Louise, therefore, has a choice.  When one of her young kids has an ear infection or something that would require a visit to the GP's office she can bundle her family into the car and face in to the inevitable traffic, and all that goes with it, to see the GP in Malahide or she can put her hands in her pocket to find &euro;45, go across the road and try to see the local doctor.  If she is lucky, she will get an appointment after two or three days.  Louise is not unique in this regard.  This is an everyday occurrence.  Parents cannot find a doctor willing to take them and, therefore, they cannot register.  Their children do not have access then to the GP services that the Minister of State and the people who sit on that side of the House were busy high-fiving each other about and congratulating each other on granting.  It is utterly useless to people in Balbriggan who cannot register with their GP and who are left without these vital services.<\/p>  <p>  Families are being forced to spend money they do not have for a service of which the Minister of State is busy telling them they can avail.  They cannot avail of it.  I want to know what will be done to alleviate the pressure because it is not going to go away.  If anything, it is actually going to get worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500043#QQ00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1485367500,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising this issue.  At the outset, I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring that patients across the State continue to have access to GP services.  There have been significant developments in the general practice service recently, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional support provided by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  The first two phases of universal GP care without fees were successfully introduced in 2015, first, for children under the age of six years and, second, for all people aged 70 years and over.  This has resulted in approximately 800,000 people now being eligible for GP care without fees and without having to undergo a means test.  The introduction free GP care for children under six represents a major step forward in improving access, quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  The service contract for GP care without fees for those who are under six, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their own communities.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity, on my behalf and that of the Minister for Health, to acknowledge the contribution of GPs to meeting the heavy demand on our health service during the peak winter period.  The management by GPs of seasonal pressures, which include many patients presenting with exacerbation of chronic conditions is an example of how primary care plays a critical role in our health care system.  I am also conscious that general practice does not take an extended holiday over the Christmas and New Year period and that GPs were dealing with a substantial workload while many other people were able to enjoy some time off.  It is important to recognise the commitment of GPs to ensuring a responsive, accessible and high-quality service to patients on a year-round basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity and in 2017 the training intake will increase for the second successive year, from 172 to 187 places.  Engagement is also commencing this month with GP representatives in the development of a new and modernised set of contractual arrangements for general medical services, GMS, and other public GP services.  To date, approximately 94% of GMS GPs have entered into agreements with the HSE for the provision of services to children under six.  Currently, almost 364,000 children under six have access to GP care without fees through a medical card or GP visit card.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn the Deputy's area, about which I know she is concerned.  There are currently eight GPs who hold GMS contracts in the Balbriggan area, of whom six also hold contracts for the provision of services to children under six years of age under terms agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, in 2015.  It would be preferable if all GPs who hold GMS contracts also agreed to hold contracts for GP care without fees for children under the age of six.  Nationally, the HSE has recently written to those GMS GPs who have not yet signed up to the under-six contract, and have provided them with a copy of the contract and the form of agreement for their consideration.  I hope that those GPs who have not yet signed up to offer this improved and expanded primary care service will do so and ensure that all children aged under six are easily able to access GP services without, as the Deputy stated, their parents or guardians having to pay a fee or travel long distances to access care.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is not aware of any instances where GPs in the Balbriggan area have declined to accept under six year olds onto their panels.  GMS GPs, however, manage their own panels and may, on occasion, close them to new patients if they consider that they have reached the limit of their practice&rsquo;s capacity.  I would add that no GP in the area has reached the maximum permitted number of patients an his or her panel.  Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him or her as a patient, and has unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area who are contracted to provide services under the GMS, then the HSE will assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.  I hope this is of help to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500043#QQ00300","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1485367500,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The short answer is that it has not really helped.  It does not solve the problem this morning, this afternoon, this evening or tonight when people are going to need to see their GPs.  It is all very well to say there are X number of children in the system who are eligible for access to this scheme but it is actually completely useless to those people who simply cannot access it.  I wonder if the Department of Health would give some consideration to reimbursing those parents who, through no fault of their own, cannot access the medical card for under sixes and are forced to pay because the service is not available in their areas?  The Minister of State said that the HSE is not aware of instances in Balbriggan but in the next breath she asks how the HSE could be aware of the position, particularly as GPs manage their own panels.  I have made the Minister of State aware of the facts.<\/p>  <p>  If the Department of Health is aware, then I - and the people in Balbriggan who are waiting - would like to know what exactly the Minister of State can do to alleviate this problem in the short term.  It is not acceptable that there are chronic waits.  Quite apart from the fact that people cannot get these medical cards, they also cannot get appointments to see GPs in Balbriggan for two, three or four days.  The GPs are already overburdened.  I absolutely join the Minister of State in lauding the commitment of GPs.  They do a fantastic job but they are only human.  They are up to the limit of their capacity.  We need to incentivise general practitioners to go to the areas they are needed and we must have salaried GPs if that is what is necessary.

I am seeking clarification of the Health Service Executive's plans to deliver a fixed cardiac catheterisation laboratory at Sligo University Hospital in 2017.  I have had previous discussions and correspondence with the Minister on this matter, which is of the utmost importance to people in the north west, including those I represent in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  A quick glance at a map of Ireland illuminates how people living in the north west are being left behind in terms of access to this life-saving cardiac service.  The major question at issue when a person presents at a hospital with an urgent cardiac arrest or other emergency cardiac illness is whether transport to a primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, centre is available within the recommended 90 minutes.  For patients in the north west, there is not a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to this question, as is often the case in our region.  The answer, unfortunately, varies from day to day and on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether or not the emergency helicopter transport service is available from Sligo at the time.  If it is not available or is out on a call, often the only option available is to give the cardia arrest patient thrombolytic treatment followed by an urgent ambulance transfer by road to either Galway or Dublin for emergency treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken to the senior consultant cardiologist at Sligo University Hospital, Dr. Donal Murray, this is unquestionably having an effect on the levels of cardiac mortality in the region.  This tragic reality of the situation must be addressed this year as a matter of urgency.  It is estimated that more than 50 patients per year are presenting at Sligo University Hospital in need of urgent attention for an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI, which is the most dangerous type of cardiac arrest.  At this time, 50 cardiac patients at Sligo face that uncertainty.  A further 150 patients present at the hospital with non-urgent STEMI heart attacks which require treatment outside the region.  More than 1,000 patients every year need angiography services which cannot be provided at the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key challenges in accessing primary PCI care in the north-west region is that the road network is not of the same standard as it is on the east coast or in the south.  For example, it takes a minimum of two hours to travel from Sligo University Hospital to Dublin by ambulance.  It takes the same length of time to get to Galway by road, but the journey by helicopter is 80 minutes.  Therefore, the only option for patients in the region is via air travel to Galway.  On that basis, Sligo needs a fixed cardiac catheterisation laboratory with three consultant cardiologists.  People living in Sligo, Leitrim, north Roscommon, south Donegal, north Mayo and west Cavan have as much right to access this service as do the people of Galway, Cork, Dublin and Waterford.  We have a combined population of more than 240,000 people, who must, as it stands, leave the region for care.  Sligo University Hospital is the perfect location for the service given its position between the other primary PCI centres in Galway and Derry.  Sligo has a proven track record in innovation, staff recruitment and clinical governance in this field and was the first hospital in the country to establish a mobile catheterisation laboratory service.  That is no longer adequate and it is time to upgrade to a fixed service, which will require a minimal capital investment.  Doing so would mitigate the impact of the lack of primary PCI care in the region.  If the service is not delivered this year, 2,000 patients will have to leave the region for cardiac procedures, which will undoubtedly lead to increased cardiac mortality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500044#RR00200","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1485368100,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which has been of concern to him for a long time.  He has been consistent in raising it with the Department and the HSE on behalf of his constituents.<\/p><p>Sligo University Hospital is currently served by a mobile cardiac catheterisation laboratory which provides services on one day per week for elective procedures.  In terms of cardiac services in the north-west region, a cross-Border cardiology service was established in early May 2016, which provides emergency primary PCI services for the treatment of patients from County Donegal with a diagnosed heart attack. at Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry.  From May through to 20 December 2016, 23 patients from County Donegal received treatment under the scheme.  Following admission and emergency treatment in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, patients are repatriated to Letterkenny University Hospital or Sligo University Hospital, depending on which is closer to their homes.  The new service runs very efficiently and is of major benefit to very sick patients living in the north-west region.<\/p><p>  Any proposal for the further development of cardiac catheterisation laboratory services at Sligo University Hospital must first be considered from a hospital group perspective and in the context of planning for the cardiology needs of the population cared for by the Saolta University Healthcare Group.  During 2017, each hospital group will he required to develop a strategic plan setting out how it proposes to organise services to provide optimal care to the population it serves and how it will achieve maximum integration and synergy across local health services, including primary and community care.  The Department of Health has developed a draft document, Guidance on Developing Hospital Group Strategic Plans, which will he circulated to hospital groups in due course.  In addition, any further development of cardiac catheterisation services at Sligo University Hospital must be considered in a national context and in the light of the competing demands for scarce resources.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to prioritising waiting lists in 2017.  Acknowledging the challenges in scheduled care provision, budget 2017 makes specific provision for the treatment of longest-waiting patients.  An allocation of &euro;20 million is set aside for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In December, my colleague, the Minister for Health, granted approval to the NTPF for the first tranche of funding, in the region of &euro;5 million, for an initiative focusing on day case procedures.  The Minister has asked the HSE to develop an inpatient and day case waiting list action plan in conjunction with, and supported by, the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10 million of 2017 funding for patient treatment.  Further, the Minister wrote to the director general of the HSE earlier this week in regard to waiting lists, with a specific request that priority be given to the development of a cardiology waiting list initiative in 2017.  In the coming weeks, the Minister expects to receive a waiting list action plan from the HSE, which will include a cardiology waiting list initiative.  That initiative will address cardiology waiting lists in a number of hospitals, including Sligo University Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500044#RR00300","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1485368100,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's response does not address my concerns.

Can the Minister of State let us know how long are the military authorities aware of an issue to do with the handling of chemicals in Baldonnel Aerodrome?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500045#SS01000","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1485368700,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Let me assure the Deputies that, as Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces are a high priority for me and the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency is currently managing six claims taken by former and current members of the Air Corps for personal injuries alleging exposure to chemical and toxic substances whilst working in the Air Corps in the period 1991 to 2006.  As litigation is ongoing, the Deputies will appreciate that I am limited in what I can discuss.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Defence Forces to manage health and safety risks to all of its members proactively.  This is done in line with national health and safety regulations.  The Defence Forces risk management system is designed to an internationally recognised standard.  The Defence Forces are committed to continuous risk mitigation and encourage inputs from personnel at all levels to ensure the work environment is as safe as possible.  Areas where members of the Defence Forces are handling toxic materials in the context of their work are subject to stringent risk mitigation and continuous review by health and safety practitioners.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> I am informed that during 2016 the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, conducted inspections at the Air Corps premises at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, on three occasions - 4 February, 5 April and 28 September.  During these visits the Air Corps outlined the most recent developments regarding its health and safety practice and procedures, which were being developed in consultation with risk management experts.  I understand that the HSA met with Air Corps personnel, safety representatives and other employees and observed some workplaces and work practices.  On 21 October 2016, the HSA issued its report of inspection to the Air Corps.  This report listed a number of advisory items for follow-up.  They included the areas of risk assessment, health surveillance, monitoring of employees' actual exposure to particular hazardous substances and the provision and use of personal protective equipment.  The Air Corps was very appreciative of the advice and support of the HSA.<\/p> <p> On 20 December, the Air Corps wrote to the HSA outlining its proposed improvement plan and indicating that the Air Corps is fully committed to implementing the improved safety measures that protect workers from potential exposures to chemicals and will ensure risks are as low as reasonably practicable.  The Air Corps has confirmed that it is implementing an improvement plan which is being conducted over eight phases.  The first phase commenced in September 2016 with planned phased completion dates to December 2017.  I am advised that seven out of the eight phases are planned to be completed by May 2017.  The eight-phase implementation plan is focused on a number of areas, for example, activity-based risk assessments.  Additional risk assessment of particular chemicals, policy review and health surveillance and biological monitoring also will be considered.<\/p> <p> I will now outline the actions I have taken to date regarding protected disclosures relating to the Air Corps, which were received in November and December 2015 and January 2016.  The Deputies will appreciate that in so doing, I must have regard to the fact that there is ongoing litigation relating to certain disclosures.  I must also have regard to the obligation in the Act to protect the identity of those making such disclosures.  I assure the Deputies that I take disclosures very seriously and the actions I have taken will illustrate this.<\/p> <p> Legal advice was sought on how best to progress certain disclosures, as elements related to matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation.  The Department was also aware that the HSA had visited the Air Corps with regard to the use and management of chemicals.  It was decided that an external reviewer should be appointed.  With some difficulty, an individual was sourced and I appointed him in July 2016 to carry out a review of the disclosures.  However, in the event, he ultimately was not in a position to carry out the review.  In September 2016, I appointed an alternative independent third party to review the allegations made in the outstanding disclosures, and those making the disclosures were informed of this fact.  I believe that in this instance, it is important that I get a clear and independent view of the issues raised by those who have made these disclosures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500045#SS01100","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485369300,"counter":453,"content":"<p>The Minister must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500046#TT00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1485369300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Can I ask the permission of the House to continue to the conclusion?

Something known as \"tubbing\" was reported, for example, which is where new recruits were tossed into baths full of unknown chemicals as a joke and an initiation process.  There is a culture in that regard.  There is a lack of appreciation of the ongoing dangers associated with these chemicals.  Also worrying is the fact that many people are reporting now that they presented with symptoms and health issues to medical doctors but were not given the assistance or help they needed.  The connection was not made, or perhaps they did not wish to make it, between their work with the hazardous materials and chemicals and the health issues they faced.  Some of them continue to experience severe health problems.  This speaks to the wider issue of adequately resourcing essential capabilities in the Defence Forces and resources in the Air Corps.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State did not answer the questions.  Has he or the Department contacted the whistleblowers?  Has the independent third party contacted the whistleblowers?  The Minister of State also did not answer my question about the safety management system review that was conducted in 2013.  Were the recommendations made in that review implemented?  The Minister of State referred to the six cases pending before the courts.  I appreciate that he cannot discuss the individual cases or their merits, but I must strongly point out that the State should only be defending cases where it believes it does not have a case to answer.  If the State has committed a wrong, it should compensate the victims properly.  The Minister of State should not put people through the trauma of a court process where they have a genuine claim.  Every effort should be made to settle such cases out of court with the individuals involved.

In two weeks&rsquo; time, we will mark the 36th anniversary of the horrific night which saw 48 young people die and a further 214 seriously injured in a fire in the infamous Stardust Ballroom in Artane, Dublin 5, early on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day 1981.  It was the worst fire disaster in modern Irish history and continues to profoundly affect many families in several parishes of my constituency of Dublin Bay North down to the present day.  This is why we are here again tonight asking for a fresh investigation, for justice and for the possibility of closure for the families and friends of the tragic victims.<\/p><p>Up to 846 young people headed off to the local Stardust disco on the night of 13 February 1981.  The ballroom, managed and owned by Eamon and Paddy Butterly, was popular with young people of the greater Coolock, Artane, Kilbarrack, Donaghmede, Raheny and surrounding areas.  Some time after 1 a.m. a fire broke out, ignited, we believe, due to electrical faults and spread rapidly, fuelled, we believe, by the large amounts of flammable materials stored in the roof area.  Panic ensued when the lighting system failed and patrons, rushing to escape as the inferno overhead dripped and spread down from the ceiling, found emergency exits either locked or draped with chains and locks.  The horror of that night and the events that followed cannot be adequately expressed here today.  Yet that trauma has haunted hundreds of families and citizens of Dublin's north side over the decades since 1981.  Up to 44 families lost brothers, sisters, daughters, sons.  Twenty-five boys and 23 girls died tragically.  Hundreds of others were seriously injured and profoundly affected.  Justice has never been served for these families and the struggle for justice for the victims of this inferno and their families continues to this day.<\/p><p>Before briefly reviewing the powerful case for a new commission, let us remember again in this House the 48 tragic victims and the infant in the womb who died.  They are: Michael Barrett, Richard Bennett, Carol Bissett, James Buckley, Paula Byrne, Caroline Carey, John Colgan, Jacqueline Croker, Liam Dunne, Michael Farrell, David Flood, Thelma Frazer, Michael French, Josephine Glen, Michael Griffiths, Robert Hillick, Brian Hobbs, Eugene Hogan, Murtagh Kavanagh, Martina Keegan, Mary Keegan, Robert Kelly, Mary Kennedy, Mary Kenny, Margaret Kiernan, Sandra Lawless, Francis Lawlor, Maureen Lawlor, Paula Lewis, Eamon Loughman, George McDermott, Marcella McDermott, William McDermott, Julie McDonnell, Teresa McDonnell, Gerard McGrath, Caroline McHugh, Donna Mahon, Helena Mangan, James Millar, Susan Morgan, David Morton, Kathleen Muldoon, George O&rsquo;Connor, Brendan O&rsquo;Meara, John Stout, Margaret Thornton and Paul Wade.<\/p><p>Amidst the pain, sorrow and national shock that such a tragedy could happen, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane was appointed to lead a tribunal of inquiry into the fire.  It held its first public sitting just three weeks after the tragedy.  Mr. Justice Keane&rsquo;s findings in June 1982 made for damning reading of the events of that night and the immediate aftermath including the failures of the owners, the Butterlys, of Dublin Corporation, of the then Department of the Environment and of the forensic examinations.  Most upsetting and shocking although was Keane&rsquo;s completely unfair and unfounded contradictory conclusion in paragraph No. 9.14 that arson was the probable cause of the fire, despite paragraph No. 6.193 earlier stating that:<\/p><blockquote>The cause of the fire is not known and may never be known.  There is no evidence of an accidental origin: and equally no evidence that the fire was started deliberately.<\/blockquote><p>The sullying of the names of these young victims and the slur over their reputations also resulted in no charges being brought against the owners.  Instead Eamon Butterly was awarded over &pound;580,000 in compensation compared to awards of just &pound;7,500 to each of the victims&rsquo; families.<\/p><p>In the decade before and throughout my political career, I have worked with, and tried to support, the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee, courageously led by Ms Antoinette Keegan, Ms Chrissie Keegan and her late husband John, Ms Gertrude Barrett, Mrs. McDermott, Mr. Jimmy Dunne, Mr. Willie Mulvey and others, some of whom are here in the Gallery with us tonight.  First, from the mid-1980s, began the committee&rsquo;s campaign to honour and commemorate the young victims.  In the early 1990s, following pickets outside the office of then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, funding was at last made available by Dublin City Council for Stardust Memorial Park.  It was completed in 1993 and has pride of place in our local Coolock community.<\/p><p>Second, campaigners strongly queried Keane&rsquo;s key conclusion and increasingly raised unanswered questions arising from his report and on the need to hold those responsible for the tragedy to account.  Since the mid-1990s, the committee has campaigned tirelessly for a full investigation and full accounting for the fire which I believe can only be realised in a new commission of investigation under the 2004 McDowell legislation.  I renew the call for the establishment of such a commission tonight.<\/p><p>The Stardust Ballroom was converted from the Scotts Foods factory and was re-designed to a leisure complex less than three years before the fire.  Keane clearly showed how important conditions of the Dublin Corporation planning permission, fire regulations and the public resort by-laws were not complied with.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>These include a consultation with a chief fire officer, the use of carpet tiles in the walls, the locking and chaining of exit doors and their obstruction, the use of timber partitions and the failure to allocate specific duties to staff in the event of a fire.  Keane rightly concluded in paragraph 9.28 that &quot;the owners did not take due precautions for the safety of the public, the performers or the employees&quot;.  Dublin Corporation is also severely criticised for its failure to properly inspect the building, as is the Department of the Environment for its failure to make building regulations under the planning Acts.  Serious shortcomings in the Garda and Department of Justice forensic examination were included in conclusion 9.64 of the Keane report.  Keane found samples of material that might have been crucial were not taken and important tests were not carried out.  It was also clear that Mr. Eamon Butterly, the owner, and several of his staff seriously obstructed the Garda investigations.  It beggars belief on revisiting chapter 9 of the Keane report, the conclusions and recommendations, that no one has ever been brought to account for the Stardust tragedy.  The owner, Mr. Eamon Butterly, was severely criticised for his action yet no prosecution was ever pursued.  On reading those conclusions again, one would never expect for the final outcome to be suspected arson.  <br\/><br\/>On several occasions in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, especially in the lead up to the 20th and 25th anniversaries of the disaster, on behalf of the Stardust committee I outlined the many reasons why so many aspects of Mr. Justice Keane's report needed to be disregarded and I called the report&rsquo;s conclusions &quot;untrustworthy, unfair and unsafe&quot;.  In a D&aacute;il speech of February 2006, I highlighted the conflict of interest in the appointment of the Fire Research Station of the UK Department of the Environment as the expert adviser to the tribunal because it was working at that time for Dublin Corporation.  I spoke about the inclusion of the untrue statement in section 8.92 of the tribunal report that &quot;the practice of locking and chaining the exit doors until midnight at the earliest on 'disco' night was not known to the Corporation&quot;.  I informed the House a number of times that I had been contacted by a city council official who explained that he had reported to officials in the building control section of Dublin Corporation more than three weeks before the catastrophe that exit doors had been locked late into the night at a function.  There were also reports that Dublin Corporation held a staff party in the Stardust the previous Christmas of 1980 and that the then Lord Mayor was present.  The tribunal report concluded there was no professional supervision of the electrical system in the reconstruction and fitting out of the Scotts Food factory which became the Stardust.  However, the Keane report completely disregarded compelling evidence relating to the electrical system and the new research totally challenged the tribunal&rsquo;s findings.  Testimony of a heat surge from the ceilings of the north and west alcoves given to Mr. Justice Keane by disco goer Linda Bishop and staff member Leo Doyle clearly pointed to the ignition and spread of the fire from the lamp room-storeroom area in the roof space.  The evidence given to Keane in 1981-1982 by external eyewitnesses like Robert O&rsquo;Callaghan and Alan Buffini also supported that conclusion.<br\/><br\/>The conclusions of Keane were seriously challenged and we believe demolished by outstanding private investigations carried out in the years preceding the 20th anniversary of the disaster in 2001 and up to 2007.  Excellent investigative work by two remarkable young local journalists, Tony McCullagh, now editor of the <i>Northside People<\/i>, and Neil Fetherstonhaugh, was put into the public domain through their 2001 book, <i>They Never Came Home: The Stardust Story<\/i>.  The title references Christy Moore's famous song about this terrible tragedy.  That book first undermined the whole structure of Keane&rsquo;s conclusions with its highlighting of serious electrical problems in the roof of the Stardust and the failure by the owners in preceding weeks and months to address this incredibly dangerous situation.  In 2004, a distinguished local scientist, Ms Geraldine Foy, also carried out further investigations and discovered the existence of a storeroom in the roof space packed with flammable liquids which was beside the lamp room.  In new evidence, Ms Foy demonstrated that maps showing a basement in the Stardust were incorrect and also drew attention to the first witnesses of the fire who were outside the building and saw flames coming from the roof.  In 2006, Ms Rita O&rsquo;Reilly and her colleagues in an RTE &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; anniversary programme cast further profound question marks over Mr. Justice Keane&rsquo;s findings.  <br\/><br\/>The Stardust relatives and victims committee finally submitted a dossier entitled &quot;Nothing But the Truth&quot; to the Department of Justice in 2007, which documented discoveries of clear evidence of defective electrical and heating systems in the building, as well as the discovery of the existence of the first floor storeroom full of flammable cleaning liquids and new eyewitness accounts which strongly pointed to the origins of the fire in the roof space and not, as Keane had believed, in the seats of the closed-off west alcove.  This dossier also listed the contents of the stored items in the roof space, all of which were highly flammable and included 45 five-gallon drums of cleaning fluids and other liquids.  All of these concerted efforts over many years put public pressure on the Government to re-examine the findings of the Keane report.  The then Bertie Ahern-led Government eventually appointed Mr. Paul Coffey, SC, now Mr. Justice Coffey, to carry out an independent examination in 2008.  Mr. Ahern lived in an estate just across the road from the Stardust.  The final Coffey report was presented to the House in January 2009 and led to the correcting of the public record in the D&aacute;il and Seanad that arson was the probable cause of the tragic fire and loss of so many young lives.  There was great disappointment in 2009 that Coffey did not call for a new public inquiry in the final version of his report presented to the Houses.  Freedom of information requests from the Stardust committee discovered that the original copy of the Coffey report sent to the Government on 10 December 2008, differed on a number of very important elements from the final report brought before the Houses in January 2009.  Paragraph 5.13 of the Coffey report of 10 December states: <\/p><blockquote>I accept that this is profoundly unsatisfactory to the survivors and the bereaved.  I also accept the Committee&rsquo;s submission that such was the scale of the disaster that it has become a matter of communal if not national history to an extent that engages a public interest in ensuring that the public record of what happened is factually accurate and established by evidence.  I further accept that a new inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence.  <\/blockquote><p>Mr. Coffey&rsquo;s original finding of 10 of December 2008 is certainly now a necessity.  The slur of suggested criminality on the young people who attended the Stardust that tragic night was removed in the Government motion of 3 February 2009, which stated that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann acknowledged &quot;that the cause of the fire is unknown, the original finding of arson is a mere hypothetical explanation and is not demonstrated by any evidence and that none of the persons present on the night of the fire can be held responsible for it&quot;.  It was 28 years after the tragedy and there was still no concrete conclusion as to who was responsible for the deaths of these 48 young people.  Mr. Justice Paul Coffey&rsquo;s report is striking in the manner in which it builds a powerful case supported by witnesses for the Stardust committee such as former fire chief, Mr. Tony Gillick, that the fire began in the roof space.  <br\/><br\/>I note media reports that the wording of the final part of the motion regarding the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the Stardust relatives and victims committee is rejected by the T&aacute;naiste yet this related specifically to the committee&rsquo;s attempts to meet directly with the Taoiseach following his promises made to them on former Deputy Terence Flanagan&rsquo;s campaign trail in 2011.  I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste met the committee personally in 2014.  There were great hopes from that meeting.  I also acknowledge that she appointed Mr. David Gilbride to be a point of contact for the committee.  Mr. Gilbride sent a report in November 2015 querying the committee's evidence.  The Stardust committee withdrew from the process with the Department on 8 December 2016 because Mr. Gilbride repeatedly informed its members their new evidence had not reached the standard of reasonable doubt on the Keane conclusions.  As fire expert, Mr. Robin Knox, has stated, only a new commission can establish such a standard. <br\/><br\/>In previous speeches, I referenced the Widgery and Saville tribunals and the Hillsborough inquests and noted there always seems to be a great reluctance in our legal system to create a new precedent by revisiting the work of a tribunal.  In the British legal system, which is so close to our own, the Government came forward with the Saville inquiry to re-examine the Widgery whitewash and vindicate the people of Derry.  It revisited the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death.  The valiant campaigns by the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday in 1972 and Hillsborough in 1989 very much resembles the indefatigable and brave campaign for justice of the Stardust relatives committee.  While the courts will admit fresh evidence in civil and criminal appeal cases, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004 do not provide an appeal mechanism, yet there are appeal mechanisms in investigative legislation such as the Railway Safety Act 2005 and the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000.  Given the UK precedents, we should be able to come forward with a new commission of investigation.  Today&rsquo;s motion has widespread support in the House.  A member of the Government sitting opposite, Deputy Finian McGrath, shared a Topical Issue debate with me in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il demanding a new commission of investigation, not more reports or going back to eminent legal people.  We already had that with Mr. Justice Coffey.  <br\/><br\/>During the 2011 general election, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, visited Coolock and committed to a new commission of inquiry.  The inclusion of the establishment of the commission of investigation dependent on the production of new evidence - the oft-repeated mantra - featured in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  <br\/><br\/>The motion before us today is in the name of the Independents 4 Change, our technical group, and AAA-PBP.  I thank my 12 colleagues in both groups.  Deputies McDonald and Mitchell and Sinn F&eacute;in are very supportive of such a motion.  I am also delighted to have a copy of a letter from the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to Ms Antoinette Keegan of 27 March 2014 in which Deputy Martin commits Fianna F&aacute;il to support a new inquiry under the 2004 Act.  I also thank the Social Democrats for their support and I hope the Green Party will also support the motion.  I have always received great support in the past from the Labour Party on this matter.  I believe there is an emerging consensus at last in the House to bring closure to the still-grieving families and friends of the young people who never came home that night by approving the motion to establish a new commission of investigation into the Stardust tragedy.  <br\/><br\/>The Government seems to be coming forward with an amendment to the effect that an eminent legal person will be appointed to review the new evidence and arguments.<\/p><p>Mr. Justice Coffey already fulfilled that function in 2008-2009 and recommended the establishment of a commission of investigation in his December 2008 report.  The amendment seems to be another instance of this Government kicking the can down the road when it comes to important issues.  After 36 long and often grief-stricken years, the Stardust victims and their relatives need final closure and justice.  I urge the House to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500048#YY00300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485371400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The motion put forward by Deputy Broughan is very simple in nature.  I want to acknowledge his work and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, because they have been steady and persistent voices in respect of this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The fact is that, 35 years on, those bereaved by what happened in the Stardust still have questions but they do not have answers.  It is ironic the Stardust tragedy happened on St. Valentine's night, which is the night associated with love and romance, not death and tragedy.  I remember that weekend very vividly.  I recall the stories coming out and the fact that the pain and anguish were intensified as the weekend progressed and more details emerged.  I also remember having attended events in the Stardust, so I could very easily visualise what had happened.  The grief was compounded by the fact the victims were all from the same area and that there were families who lost more than one member.<\/p>  <p>  I dislike the word \"closure\" because it seems to suggest there can be an end to the grief at the loss of a loved one and I do not think that can happen.  However, there is no doubt that if family and friends have answers to their questions and have a full picture of what happened, it does ease the grieving process.  That has not happened in the case of the Stardust.  Unfortunately, we have a poor record in this country when it comes to establishing and revealing the truth.  How long did families and individuals wait in the context of the Magdalen laundries?  The families of the victims and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings over 40 years ago are still waiting for answers.<\/p>  <p>  The Stardust tragedy was the worst of its kind in the history of the State, with 48 young people losing their lives in appalling circumstances.  We can imagine those young people struggling to escape and their consternation at perhaps getting to a fire escape to find chains around the bars.  We can imagine the failure of the lighting adding to the panic and confusion inside.  The windows were not an option because there were bars and blades around them.  The rescue services outside were frustrated because they could hear and see what was going on but they could not reach those inside.  It is important to acknowledge all the work of the rescue services.<\/p>  <p>  Afterwards, it was a question of finding out what happened and who was responsible.  We know of the Coolock Garda investigation, the tribunal of inquiry and the issue of arson, which allowed the owners to pursue a claim for quite hefty compensation.  The \"Prime Time\" programme in 2006 cast doubts on some of those findings.  That was followed by Mr. Justice Paul Coffey's independent examination, which found no evidence of the fire being started deliberately but identified breaches of fire safety regulations.  We know there were alterations to the initial Coffey report, which, in itself, necessitates a full and independent inquiry for the relatives.<\/p>  <p>  Listening to the relatives, it is clear their grief is raw - it is as if it only happened last Friday.  We think of how long it took to get to the truth of what happened in Derry on Bloody Sunday and at Hillsborough.  In both situations, we also know the relief for the relatives when the facts were revealed.  In the Derry case, there was the added bonus for the relatives when they received an apology from David Cameron.<\/p>  <p>  The families have never given up, which is a great credit to them, and they have recent research which shows there is new evidence.  A researcher has listened to the witnesses who were both inside and outside the Stardust, has looked at inaccuracies in the map of the building that was used at the tribunal and has examined the 999 calls.  There are many questions.<\/p>  <p>  The motion notes that the Government was looking for new evidence and I think that has now been brought forward.  The relatives handed in a list to the Attorney General's office a couple of months ago and they are still awaiting a response.  Given all of the inconsistences and questions regarding the original findings and the changes in the findings, the only way forward is a comprehensive and independent investigation.  I am aware of the talks people have been having with the relatives and I know that the Government amendment states that new evidence will be assessed by an independent person who has the trust of the families.  I also understand that, if that independent person confirms this new evidence, there will be a commission of investigation.  However, that cannot be a further delaying tactic in regard to establishing the truth.  Mr. Justice Coffey's report in 2008 indicated the need for an inquiry.  For me, it is not a matter of what anybody in this Chamber wants.  It is what the families want, what they deserve and what they are owed.  It is a matter of national interest and not just for the people of north Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500050#AAA00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1485371400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;misgivings around previous investigations&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;- there has been important work conducted by individual researchers on a voluntary basis over many years into the causes of the tragedy; and<br \/><br \/>- the Programme for a Partnership Government specifically states that 'full regard will be had to any new evidence which emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at Stardust';calls on the Government to meet with the Stardust Relatives&rsquo; and Victims Committee regarding the new and updated evidence they have uncovered since reviewing Judge Keane&rsquo;s Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry on the fire at the Stardust, Artane, Dublin in 2006, to have that new and updated evidence assessed urgently by an independent person who has the trust of the families; and<br \/><br \/>if the independent assessment confirms the existence of new evidence, calls on the Government to immediately establish a Commission of Investigation into the Stardust Tragedy of 1981.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important matter.  As has been said, the events that occurred at the Stardust in the early hours of St. Valentine's Day 1981 are ones that have lived long in the memories of those of us who were old enough to recognise the tragedy that was unfolding before us as we woke that morning.  The scale of the tragedy as it emerged was overwhelming.  Across the country, thousands of people, young and not so young, went out on a Friday night to dance, celebrate and enjoy themselves.  They said goodbye to their loved ones, told them they would see them later and made plans for the following day.  They did and said all the things that we do in such routine circumstances.  Every parent worries when their child, of whatever age, is heading out for the night.  We tell them to mind themselves and to be careful, but we never think that something like this could happen.<\/p><p>Forty-eight young people lost their lives.  Many more were seriously injured and live with those scars, both physical and psychological, to this day.  We can only imagine the alarm of the families whose loved ones were out that night as word of the fire emerged, the panic they must have felt and the torment they went through as they sought out news of their loved ones.  For some, there was relief; for others, the torture of desperately trying to keep hope while they awaited news; but, for so many, there was only despair.<\/p><p>Tragedies such as this, and thankfully they are few, impact on a wider community than just those present on the night.  The impact on the victims and their families and friends, on all those caught up in this terrible event, cannot be forgotten.  It has not been forgotten.  Members of these Houses have in the past spoken of their memories of these events and of people they knew who were injured and who lost their lives.  The Stardust fire is part of our communal history.  It is right that it is not forgotten and that we continue, in this House, to discuss and consider any measure that may address the terrible legacy of the fire.<\/p><p>Immediately after the fire, a tribunal of inquiry was established.  The tribunal reported in June 1982.  Deputies are familiar with the report's findings, which were highly critical of the building's owners, the fire safety measures in place, the means of escape and the response of the emergency services.  Deputy Broughan has gone into much of the detail.  Over the following years, the findings of the tribunal, particularly as they related to the finding of probable arson, were the source of great dissatisfaction for many victims.  Concerns also emerged as to whether the real cause of the fire had been identified and the adequacy of the investigations that were carried out.<\/p><p>Throughout the first half of the last decade, the committee representing victims and their relatives communicated these concerns to Government.  The committee's submissions also advanced an alternative hypothesis as to the cause of the fire.  Following this, the Government of the day agreed, in 2008, to appoint an independent legal expert, Mr. Justice Paul Coffey, to examine the case made by the committee.  His report was published in January 2009 and dealt in some detail with the findings of the original tribunal report.  Its key conclusion was that, &quot;the Tribunal's conclusion as to the cause of the fire cannot be demonstrated to be objectively justifiable&quot;, and that the tribunal's finding of fact that the fire was probably started deliberately was on its true construction a hypothetical finding only.  The report's conclusion that the finding of arson in the original tribunal report was hypothetical only and that no one present could be held responsible addressed a long-standing stigma of suggested criminality that some of the victims and bereaved felt hung over all who had been in attendance that night.<\/p><p>The report also considered the hypothesis put forward by the committee as to the cause of the fire but concluded it had not identified any evidence which could establish its cause.  It also found that, &quot;the new and other evidence relied upon by the committee at its highest merely establishes that the fire began in the roof space but does not establish its point of origin or cause&quot;.<\/p><p>Following that, the Government of the day in 2009 moved motions in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad which were supported on an all-party basis in both Houses.  The motions acknowledged, &quot;the view of Mr. Coffey that to establish a new Tribunal to investigate the cause of the fire in the absence of any identified evidence would not be in the public interest&quot;.  That was accepted at that time in an all-party motion in this House.<\/p><p>While the findings of the independent legal examination were widely welcomed at the time, subsequently, some family members raised concerns about the process and its outcome.  On my appointment as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, I met with Ms Antoinette Keegan, Ms Geraldine Foy, a researcher and advisor to the committee, and the committee's solicitor, Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, to hear at first hand their concerns.  Following that meeting, I appointed an official in my Department to liaise with the committee.  There has been significant engagement with Ms Antoinette Keegan, Ms Geraldine Foy and Mr. Robin Knox, another researcher associated with the committee, through that mechanism.  I am of the view that significant progress was made in 2015 with collaborative efforts between them and the Department, resulting in the drawing up a document outlining the case as they presented it.<\/p><p>Subsequently, they indicated that they wished to provide further material to my Department and the engagement continued.  Further material was provided to the Department in January 2016.  Engagement on these lines had been continuing up until the end of 2016, at which point the committee decided not to proceed with the process.  I respect this decision.<\/p> <p> I am mindful, as is the Government, of the understandable depth of feeling of those affected by this tragedy and of the need to avoid adding to their distress.  It would be regrettable, against a background where there has previously been broad agreement in the House on motions relating to these events, if this consensus could not be maintained.<\/p> <p> Returning to the motions passed in the House following the 2009 report, which accepted the view of Mr. Coffey that to establish a new tribunal to investigate the cause of the fire in the absence of any identified evidence would not be in the public interest, the key issue that now arises is whether any new evidence can be identified as to the cause of the fire.  To address this, the Government proposes in its amendment that, in the first instance, an independent person be appointed to assess urgently the question of whether any new evidence can be identified.  The Government will act on these findings.  As stated in the programme for Government, \"Full regard will be had to any new evidence which emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at Stardust.\"  If the independent assessment confirms the existence of new evidence, a commission of investigation will be established and the Government will proceed on the basis as outlined in the amendment.<\/p> <p> I strongly believe this is the appropriate way forward.  As I have said - and I think every Member of the House will agree with me - it is right that the tragedy is not forgotten and that we continue in this House to discuss and consider any measure that may address the terrible legacy of the Stardust fire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500050#AAA00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485372000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome the family members of victims and survivors of the Stardust fire here and I commend my colleague, Deputy Broughan, on bringing forward this motion.  As he indicated, it follows on from work carried out by serving and former Members of this House, including my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey.<\/p>  <p>  There is almost a biblical quality to the pleadings of the families of the Stardust victims.  There is equally almost a biblical quality to the delay in the response from Government to them.  They find themselves back here once again, after 35 years - just a fortnight, as Deputy Broughan said, before another emotional and raw reminder of the tragedy passes - appealing to the Government to help them right a grave wrong, square a circle and ensure that their voices are heard and their pleas do not fall on deaf ears.  The lengths to which they have been forced to go are unjust, unfair and painful, and the resistance to those pleas causes so much unnecessary pain, so much hurt and so much justifiable anger.<\/p>  <p>  There are still questions regarding the causes of the fire, which means there is a chance that justice has been and is being delayed.  A Government inquiry carried out by an independent expert produced two reports, one of which was finalised after scores of changes - I accept there is nothing unusual about that - until a freedom of information request indicated that the unpublished report accepted that a further public inquiry was necessary.<\/p>  <p>  As one of the survivors who lost young members of her family 35 years ago said today, \"when you get truth, you get justice\".  The survivors have compelling reasons to believe that previous attempts at uncovering the truth of the events of the night of the Stardust fire have been incomplete and in some cases even contradictory.  All the survivors want is that the truth - the whole truth - be put on public record and that all available and new evidence be interrogated and laid bare.  This is the least the relatives of those who perished deserve and the least the survivors and their families are entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  The families are weary from grief and exhausted from seeking justice for their relatives and the survivors of the Stardust tragedy.  However, they are, if nothing else, resilient.  They continue to find the strength and resolve to carry on the fight for justice and truth.  The real scandal is that, 35 years on, families are still fighting for truth and justice.  I ask the House to imagine the personal and cumulative toll of simply being unable to rest easy in the knowledge that one's story has been told and that the truth of the matter has been revealed in respect of those who lost their innocent young lives on that fateful evening.  Until the suspicions that linger about the investigation of this matter and about a lack of forthrightness on the part of State agencies, until the truth is placed - unvarnished - on public record, the families of the Stardust victims and survivors can never rest easy.<\/p>  <p>  As the Government's amendment recognises, there is justification for further investigations into the events surrounding the outbreak of fire at the Stardust.  These investigations need to be timely, speedy, efficient and broad, and not truncated in any unnecessary way.  The families will not tolerate being thwarted again or having their concerns placed on the long finger by Government.  There are a number of areas of concern to the families that are worthy of further investigation, some of which have been alluded to already by Deputy Broughan.  Even the Taoiseach this morning stated that the families have never received a full account of what happened and conceded that they feel very strongly about answers that were not given.  I understand that the Government's counter-motion involves some movement on this issue and that it appears the Government will agree to meet with the Stardust Victims Committee regarding the new and updated evidence the committee has uncovered.  As stated in the motion, it is important that the evidence is assessed as a matter of urgency by an independent person who has the trust of the families.  I completely support the request that if this independent assessment confirms the existence of new evidence, as the motion also suggests, the Government immediately and speedily move to establish a commission of investigation into the Stardust tragedy of 1981.  The victims who perished and the survivors who want to lead what remains of their lives and to honour and respect their dead deserve no less.<\/p>  <p>  The families have never given up.  Unbelievably and very movingly, they have never stopped believing in the ability of Parliament and parliamentarians and of Government and Ministers to deliver the unvarnished truth.  They have nowhere else to turn, and we cannot let them down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500051#BBB00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1485372000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The Stardust fire was one of the most significant events in the history of our capital city.  It was the worst tragedy to befall our capital city in the 20th century, exceeding even the Dublin bombings which took place in the 1970s.  It is an event which has had enduring consequences.  On a national level, after the fire took place, it had the consequence of striking fear into the hearts and minds of parents throughout the country who wondered and feared whether their children would be safe going out to socialise in the evenings.  Locally, in north Dublin, it traumatised the community from which the bereaved came.  Most seriously of all, it devastated the lives of the families involved, having lost their children who went out that evening to go to what they thought would be a Valentine's disco but which ended up in tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  There were also other consequences.  These will be of cold comfort to the families, but there were positive consequences in that the fire reformed entirely the fire regulations in this country.  The fire regulations we have derive mainly from the tragic and terrible experience this country, the families in particular, went through as a result of the Stardust fire.  In many respects, the Stardust fire did for fire regulations what the Church Street tragedy of 1913 did for tenement buildings in this capital city.  The tragedy of 1913 effectively brought about a recognition on the part of Dublin Corporation that the time for tenements had to end.  Similarly, the Stardust fire meant that fire regulation in this country was significantly and dramatically improved.<\/p><p>It is important to see where we are before going on to consider what is best for the families and what can be achieved for them.  <\/p> <p> The report of the tribunal of inquiry reached a finding that arson was the cause of the fire, but that finding has been discredited and can no longer stand.  There were innumerable campaigns by the families which led to the appointment of Mr. Paul Coffey in 2008\/2009.  Although there have been criticisms of his report, it is important to note that he found that the finding of arson in the tribunal's report had been based on a hypothesis and was not justified in considering facts produced in evidence before the tribunal.  In the aftermath of the report of Mr. Coffey, this House set the record straight on the Keane report by unanimously agreeing a motion on 3 February 2009 that acknowledged that the cause of the fire was unknown and that the original finding of arson in the report of the tribunal of inquiry report was merely a hypothetical explanation not demonstrated by any evidence and that none of the persons present on the night of the fire could be held responsible for it.  That was the mechanism the State used to ensure the finding made in the report of the tribunal of inquiry could be changed.  The Official Report recorded that there was no evidence which supported a finding that the fire had been caused by arson.<\/p> <p> The work of the families and those assisting them has brought them to the objective of trying to identify what caused the fire.  The report of the tribunal of inquiry got it wrong; the Coffey report got it right when it stated there wsas no basis in fact for the finding that the fire had been caused by arson, but it could not identify the cause.  The families are entitled to - I can understand why they want to - establish the cause of the fire on that fateful night.  If there is new evidence which supports a finding that the fire was caused by a certain activity or that can lead to a conclusion on how it started, a commission of investigation should be established.  The proposal made in the Government's amendment is that the evidence should be assessed to see whether it can stand up before a commission of investigation.  It is important that the families be aware that commissions of investigation can be cold and impersonal.  I do not want and no Member here wants the families to leave here believing that through the establishment of a commission of investigation they will be able to identify the cause of the fire.  A commission of investigation would only reach a finding based on evidence properly admissible before a tribunal of inquiry not dissimilar from the rules in a court of law.  It is important to assess and identify the evidence that is said to be new and whether it is sufficient to reach a finding by a commission of investigation that the fire was caused in a particular way.  The objective of any commission of investigation is to establish the truth.  If an inquiry is established I hope it will be able to identify the cause of the fire.  However, I do not want the families to leave here believing a commission of investigation would result in the tragedy and unfairness to them being rectified because at the end of the process the commission might not be able to establish the cause of the fire.  If there is sufficient strong evidence, it would be able to do so.  The families should be aware that a commission is and cold and impersonal and will only reach findings based on facts which are properly admitted in evidence before it.  <\/p> <p> Many Members of this House agree that if we are to establish a commission of investigation, decisions should be made promptly.  It is unfair to the families to drag it out for much longer.  If there is to be a scoping exercise to appraise the new evidence, that must be done promptly in order to ensure any commission of investigation is established in the very near future.  Deputy Thomas P. Broughan is correct to say the Saville and Hillsborough inquiries were able to examine the findings of previous inquiries.  We should not underestimate the task facing any individual who is asked to produce a finding of fact on an event which happened 36 years ago.  That would be very difficult.  Findings of fact can be based only on evidence given by individuals who were there or documents which were produced at the time.  It is important to bring matter this to a conclusion quickly and that we do not prolong the families' uncertainty as to whether there will be an investigation.  For that reason, we need to quickly and independently assess the new evidence to see whether it would justify the establishment of a commission of investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500051#BBB00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485372600,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Thomas P. Broughan for raising this matter and his comprehensive review of the tragedy.  The fire in the Stardust nightclub in 1981 was an horrific tragedy.  The loss of life and widespread injuries caused by it stand as one of the greatest tragedies in modern Irish history.  Of the 700 young people in attendance that night, 48 never came home and 128 were seriously injured.  Devastated survivors and families, together with the local community, all struggled to come to terms with the scale of the disaster.  I was 19 years old at the time of the fire and had attended various cabarets at the Stardust nightclub.  I think of the tragedy every time I drive along the Kilmore Road and on Valentine's Day and every time I see or hear a reflection of the 1980s.  I have no doubt that all those who were caught up in the tragedy think about it every day of their lives.<\/p>  <p>  A tribunal of inquiry set up at the time made several recommendations and their implementation led to a complete transformation of fire safety and protection laws.  The view was that everything should be done to ensure such a fire would never happen again.  The finding that the cause of the fire was probably arson caused widespread hurt to the families affected.  In 2008 Paul Coffey's report concluded that the finding that it had probably been caused by arson was merely hypothetical.  Motions were passed in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to the effect that there was no evidence that the fire had been started deliberately and that the cause of the fire remained unknown.  In addition, Mr. Coffey found that none of the victims of the fire, or persons present on the night, could be held responsible for it.  He also found that the public interest would not be served by establishing a further inquiry.  I have, however, read media reports which suggest previous drafts of his report had been watered down and that he might, in fact, have suggested there was a need for a new inquiry.  I have no knowledge of this and think the matter needs to be fully explained by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  As a local public representative since 1985, I have worked with the Stardust relatives and victims committee on several issues.<\/p><p>I have worked with the victims' committee on a number of issues, including certain planning applications regarding the Stardust site and the provision of a suitable memorial.  The Stardust Memorial Park is now part of the community in Bonnybrook.  In addition, a lot of work was done on identifying the remains of five previously unidentified victims.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of a new demand for a commission of inquiry to establish the cause of the fire.  According to a report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 24 January 2017, the committee believes significant new evidence has emerged in recent years.  I understand that this has been uncovered by the researcher for the families, Geraldine Foy.  The issue seems to relate to the location of the fire when it first broke out.  There is a dispute about whether it broke out in the seating area or the roof space.  I have not seen this new evidence, but if there is new evidence it must be investigated.<br\/><br\/>I have noted the Government amendment to the motion and I am in agreement with it.  I support the Government amendment but as other speakers have said, I sincerely hope this process will be a speedy one.  I hope it will be finalised as soon as possible and that the families involved finally receive justice and some sort of closure.  I note what Deputy O'Sullivan said about the word &quot;closure&quot;.  Perhaps that is not possible, but as national legislators we should certainly do everything to ensure that the families can move on from this as best they can.  I echo the words of my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan that this cannot be dragged out.  We need to get to the bottom of it if we can.  We should certainly do everything we can in this regard.  I hope this debate will set the process moving speedily, so that we can bring some sort of finality to this long-standing issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500052#CCC00200","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485373200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I want to start by welcoming the families to the Visitors Gallery on this difficult evening.  I know how hard it must be for them.  Not far from here on the northside of Dublin, 48 young people lost their lives in the Stardust fire.  They were young people, with an average age of 19 years, who never came home.  We also remember the hundreds of others who were injured in the fire.  Words cannot fully describe the enormity of pain involved in the deaths of 48 young people on St. Valentine's night, including the pain their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters have been feeling since then.  Words cannot do justice to the families.  Only the truth can do them justice.<\/p>  <p>  Families, survivors and the community need to find the answers to this horrific tragedy.  Correcting any possible injustice should be the obvious action by any Government.  In this respect it should be pursued to the end. <\/p>  <p>  The journey the families have had to go through began on that awful night in 1981 and it continues to this very day, from the flawed Keane report in 1982 - we all know that report added much more pain for the families - to the Coffey review of 2009, which contained an unpublished recommendation for a new inquiry.  The Minister and her Government have the power to take action and help to discover the truth by creating a commission of investigation.  <\/p>  <p>  The State claims that it needs new evidence.  The families have given the Department of Justice and Equality new evidence which should be used in a commission of investigation.  Will the Minister and her Government help the families to find the truth?  They should not delay justice any longer with the Government amendment.  It is almost 36 years since the tragedy and it has been a long time for families who are seeking the truth.  Action needs to be taken for those who died long before their time, as well as for the injured and their families.  This Government needs to pursue a commission of investigation to find the truth for them.  The Minister should not prolong their pain any longer.

My first recollection was as a young person living in Dublin and hearing the news of this tragedy on the radio.  I was a Sinn F&eacute;in youth spokesperson at the time.  I remember putting out a statement expressing my condolences to the families involved.  It is a long time ago.  Deputy O'Callaghan said it changed the fire regulations.  However, I remember visiting a nightclub in Galway with a group of friends a couple of years later.  After about ten minutes we all had this uncomfortable feeling and left.  The reason we left was that we noticed there were chains on the fire doors, yet this was a number of years after the Stardust tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  Those young people went out to enjoy themselves, but many of them did not come home.  Many others were scarred for life.  I remember meeting some of them over the years, including the campaigners who tirelessly tried to get politicians to raise the matter.  The Minister says it is regrettable that we do not have a consensus.  I cannot speak on behalf of the families and do not know how they feel about the Government's amendment.  There was a consensus up to tonight on this matter.  There was general agreement that the way forward was a commission of investigation.  I am saddened that people blinked and, for whatever reasons, took a decision to go down that path.  I hope it works out for the families because they are all getting older and more tired, yet they all want answers.<\/p>  <p>  A constituent, Mark Frazer, said today that the one question that is forever discussed within his family is why no one was ever prosecuted over the chained and blocked fire exit.  I do not have the answers to that, but I know who was guilty.  It was not the young people who went to the dance that night.  I have made my views well known over the years.  I know who was behind this tragedy - it was the people who put the locks, bolts and chains on the door.

It goes against the natural order of things, yet these families faced that reality and have lived with it since that awful event.  I am really disappointed that we are re-running a well run tape.  The political system is telling the families that it will support them and will support their quest for truth, yet at the same time the latest barrier is thrown up to stall that quest.  Why?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste's logic is perverse in the amendment she has moved.  It seems she believes a commission of investigation should be limited to only that evidence that can be brought forward by the families or the committee.  Of course, that is not the case, as it is the job of the State to find out what happened.  It is not for the families or committee to do it and the State has an obligation to establish that.<\/p> <p> The initial finding of probable arson was not just unsubstantiated, it was a lie.  It maligned the good names of those 48 young people who were either burnt or died from smoke inhalation.  It was a nasty, malign lie.  Fortunately, those young people have been given back their good name as that finding was taken from the public record.  Now the job is to go one step further and establish the commission of investigation rather than stalling any longer.  The evidence should be examined, as the Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il have suggested, in order to test its quality and veracity.  We should seek more information and evidence.  If it is then the case that we cannot be conclusive as to the precise cause of the fire, so be it, but it is the job of the State to act immediately to establish those facts.<\/p> <p> I have a friend called Debbie who was there on the night.  I am sure she would like to give testimony to a commission of investigation.  She describes the fire as she ran for her life - she lost two friends that night - as a monster in its ferocity.

After all these years, the families have still not got the full truth about why their loved ones died and the inadequate way in which the tragedy was investigated and dealt with by the institutions of the State.<\/p>  <p>  One example of this inadequate response can be seen in the report from the Stardust victims compensation tribunal to the Oireachtas in 1985.  The compensation tribunal noted that in many cases, the establishment of the tribunal led to victims being examined and treated by doctors for the first time.  In many cases the doctors were shocked, not to say indignant, that people who needed medical advice and treatment had been left without it for so many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500054#EEE00500","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1485373800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Deputy Brendan Ryan will give the Deputy one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500054#EEE00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1485373800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  <\/p>  <p>  In many ways the State carried on abysmally in its treatment of the Stardust families and survivors.

They deserve that every effort be made to provide them with answers.  The Taoiseach also stated he did not see any difficulty in having members of the Government meet the families and that must happen as soon as possible.  A date should be put forward by the Government immediately to start the process.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that a commission of investigation should take place into this tragedy as a number of questions must be fully examined.

The logical course of action is apparent.  There should be a new independent investigation established as quickly as possible.  I was a frequent patron of the Stardust and I had been there just the week before, with many others from north Dublin.

Broughan and the Independents 4 Change group for bringing forward this motion and the Deputy's comprehensive presentation of the case for the motion tonight.  Nobody could add to that in any serious way.  The Stardust tragedy is a sorrowful part of our nation's history and anybody who lived in Ireland in February 1981 will never forget that time when all those innocent lives were lost.  As representatives in this House, many of us have contributed to debates and asked questions seeking truth and justice over many years.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2009 I spoke in the Seanad following the release of the Coffey report earlier that year or at the back end of the previous year.  On that night I welcomed the motion and described the Coffey report as a vindication of the valiant efforts of the 28-year campaign by the Stardust families, relatives and victims group.  Unfortunately, like many representatives speaking in that debate, I did not have the full facts of the findings at my disposal.  We found out subsequently, on foot of a freedom of information request from the committee for the families, that a line in the Coffey report accepting \"that a new inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence\" was deleted.  This was presented by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the day.<\/p>  <p>  If the omitted sentence had been included, it would have led to an entirely different debate back in 2009 and it certainly would have led to parties and individual Deputies seeking different outcomes from those called for in 2009.  This omission from the Coffey report stands independent of any other factors as a reason to ensure this motion should be passed.  Unfortunately, it seems this Government, again with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, is resorting to its tried and tested response to any brave or tough decision, which is to kick the can down the road.<\/p>  <p>  The Stardust tragedy will never be forgotten.  For everybody who remembers that fateful night in 1981, just the one word brings back the horrific memories and tragic loss of life that was seen.  Stardust is a one-word evocation of a national tragedy that we will never forget.  Even generations of people born after 1981 know exactly what is being spoken about if the word \"Stardust\" is mentioned.  It is etched in our collective conscience.  The 48 young souls lost that night are the reasons we will never forget it.  Never before or since have so many of our young people perished in such tragic and avoidable circumstances.  What also keeps this tragedy in our thoughts and actions is the quest for truth and justice.  It is the reason families have sustained their campaign over so many years.  They are not at peace as the full truth is not yet known.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make every effort to find the full truth of what happened that night and there is public support for a commission of investigation.  I acknowledge the commitment to this cause from Deputy Broughan.  I know from first-hand experience, when we were colleagues in the Labour Party, of his dedication to this cause over many years.  In light of that I was slightly disappointed that Sinn F&eacute;in chose to raise the matter at Leaders' Questions today ahead of the planned debate this evening on Deputy Broughan's motion.  I am also aware of efforts made by the families to meet officials in recent years.  I know efforts were made by us in the last Government to facilitate these meetings and move forward the campaign.  I am aware of how difficult it has been at times to keep the process on track, and tonight's debate is another important stage of that campaign.<\/p>  <p>  The vote we take in the House tomorrow will have an impact on whether we move closer to examining all the available evidence in a full inquiry or further delays and obstacles will be put in place.  With this motion there is an opportunity once and for all to deliver a full inquiry that will include all available evidence, most especially the new evidence provided by the committee.  The people of north Dublin and the entire country wish to see justice done but it is the families still campaigning for justice that need the inquiry most of all.  We support any avenue that will deliver the truth and we will work with all in the House, as well as the families and relatives of victims, to achieve this aim.  The Labour Party will support the motion in the vote tomorrow and we will oppose any amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500054#EEE01000","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1485373800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for facilitating the previous Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500054#EEE01100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1485374400,"counter":502,"content":"<p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I commend Deputy Thomas P. Broughan for bringing forward this motion, his brilliant advocacy on behalf of the Stardust families and his review of the case this evening.  I commend Antoinette, Robin, Geraldine and all the families who have fought long and hard to get justice and truth for the families and victims.<\/p>  <p>  The suffering, hardship and pain endured by the families is simply indescribable.  No one in the House can ever fully know or understand it.  That hardship, suffering and loss cannot be undone.  However, what we can do is give closure, truth and justice to the families and victims.  Again and again, the families have said they want to establish the truth and get justice on the basis of a new commission of investigation that would look at all the evidence, in particular, the new evidence that they have already presented to the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should correct the record following what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il today.  He said he had not seen or the Government had not seen the evidence.  At the request of Antoinette Keegan, I personally handed the file with the evidence to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the last day of the last D&aacute;il.  The Government has the evidence, which includes, although it is not limited to, facts relating to the five dead young men found some 29 feet away from the west alcove, where, the Keane report claims, the fire started.  According to the pathologist, Derek Carson, the men were already dead from carbon monoxide poisoning at the point when Judge Keane said the fire started.  These two things cannot both be true.  The pathologist says they were dead from carbon monoxide poisoning before the point when, according to the official report, the fire started in the western alcove.<\/p>  <p>  Second, a 999 telephone call was made by Brenda Kelly at 1.43 a.m., reporting that there was a fire in the roof and that it was well advanced.  Judge Keane states a small fire started in the western alcove at 1.43 a.m.  Both statements cannot be true.  The evidence of Brenda Kelly has not been taken into account.  Furthermore, there is evidence that the map used as the basis for the official findings on the fire was not the correct map.  This was something that even Butterly said at the Keane hearing.  He said the map was wrong and that it did not show the storeroom where, the families believe, the fire actually started earlier than the time given in the official record.  They believe it started there because the room was full of combustible material placed there by the owners of the night club and neglected electrics likely ignited that combustible material, which caused the firestorm that killed 48 young people.  That is the evidence, and it is sufficient evidence for the families to expect a commission of inquiry after all these years.  We do not need another review of it.  We need a proper and full investigation of all the evidence.  That would be sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  The families also want to get to the bottom of the fact that there are two Coffey reports, the first of which recommends a new inquiry to assess compelling evidence.  In the letter accompanying that first report, there is no mention of it being a draft, although the Government insists on using that term.  In the letter, Mr. Coffey states that, pursuant to his appointment on 11 July, he has completed his examination of the Stardust Victims Committee's case for a reopened inquiry.  This was in Mr. Coffey's letter of 8 December.<\/p>  <p>  We have also discovered something following a freedom of information request.  I asked for information under the freedom of information process and got a response from the Minister on 17 January 2017.  We asked for the records pursuant to any meetings that took place on foot of the first report.  I got a response from the Minister stating there were no records and no meetings, yet the freedom of information request provided to the families shows that documents existed.  They were not released under the freedom of information request, but they existed.  Therefore, the D&aacute;il was misled.  There were two memoranda.  One was from the Department of Justice and Equality and the other was a memorandum for the information of the Government along with associated Government papers.  They were not released because they were part of Government deliberations on the report.  Those memoranda should be released because they are key to understanding what changed between the first report that recommended a new inquiry and the second report.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister insists on calling the first report a draft, but Mr. Coffey disputes that in his letter.  The Minister has no evidence to support the claim.  The Minister states Mr. Coffey asked for the right to clarify, change and amend the report.  Where is the evidence for that?  There is nothing in the freedom of information documentation or the correspondence from Mr. Coffey to support the claim; surely Mr. Coffey would have said it.  When Mr. Coffey was submitting his report to the Minister, surely he would have explained that it was a draft and that he intended to make further changes.  Why did he not say that?  Where is the evidence to confirm that he wanted to amend it?  There is none.  He refers to it as a completed report.<\/p>  <p>  Something happened after that point, whatever considerations and memoranda passed between various Departments.  Whatever the nature of the deliberations at the Cabinet, lo and behold, a new report came out with 70 changes, including, critically, the change removing Mr. Coffey's recommendation for a new inquiry.  We need the truth on this.  What happened?  What was in those memoranda?  What happened in the Cabinet when this evidence was discussed?  Why does the Government insist on stating it does not have new evidence when that new evidence has been presented?  There is no need for further delay.  There is no need to make another hurdle for the families to jump over.  They have fought between 1981 and 2008 to exonerate their kin from the charge of being guilty of their own killings.  Now, another hurdle is being put in their way.  That hurdle should be removed.  The amendment should be withdrawn and the commission of investigation should be set up forthwith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500055#FFF00100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1485374400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I have no hesitation in supporting the motion tabled by Deputy Thomas P.

For the record, it is important to point out that what happened at the time was clearly against fire regulations.  That was set out clearly in the report by Mr. Justice Ronan Keane.

We should bear in mind the physical barriers in place on the night when the doors were locked and the number of barriers that the families have had to cope with since then over a 36 year period.

The families and their solicitor have long been deeply sceptical of the 2009 Coffey report, stating that over 70 highly significant changes made to the report before its publication had the effect of neutering and diluting Mr. Paul Coffey&rsquo;s original recommendations, including his acceptance that a new inquiry might be necessary.

Nearly 36 years on, victims and their families of the Stardust tragedy have yet to find the truth, despite their desperate and commendable search for it.  Their search for truth has been obstructed at every turn by nearly everyone who had the power to retrieve it.  Apart from Mr. Butterly&rsquo;s own attempts to obstruct justice, the shortcomings of the Garda investigation itself have been called into question, including the Department of Justice&rsquo;s handling of evidence.  Conclusions of arson made by the Keane tribunal report in 1982 were controversial and helped secure Mr. Butterly handsome compensation as a result.  Even this seemed to have benefited everyone else apart from the victims and their families who were left with questions still unanswered.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Paul Coffey carried out an independent examination in 2008, and he gave a completely different finding that arson was not the cause.  However, the Coffey report was manipulated in between the time the Government got hold of it and when it was presented to this House in January 2009.  This was discovered through the efforts of the Stardust families, their drive to seek justice as strong as ever.  Through a freedom of information inquiry, they discovered that in an earlier draft of the report, Mr. Coffey stated: \"I further accept that a new inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence.\"  However, this was absent from the public report.  It is almost certain that this was an attempt by the Government itself to cover up the truth.  Those who had the most power to uncover the truth played a role in concealing it.  This alone warrants an independent commission of investigation.<\/p>  <p>  We have a problem with truth in this country.  Whether it was the Catholic church, industrial schools, Magdalen laundries, our health system that allowed symphysiotomy, residential care homes, the role of the Garda in certain historic investigations, councillors or Deputies, Ministers and the Government of the day, we all have a problem with truth.  Today, we have an opportunity to address this problem, not only for the sake of justice for the victims and families of the Stardust tragedy, but for all searches for the truth.  We can do this by supporting the establishment of an independent commission of investigation into the Stardust tragedy as the only way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500056#GGG00300","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1485375000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I sincerely wish to thank Deputy Thomas P. Broughan for bringing forward this Bill calling for a commission of investigation into the Stardust fire and for his work with the families of victims and survivors of this brutal tragedy, which is what it is.  I also congratulate those, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, for their perseverance and courage over 36 years in their quest for truth and justice for their loved ones.  It is not an impossible quest.  This was demonstrated by the campaign for the re-opening of the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster by the Liverpool 96 campaign.  The new inquest vindicated the families with its verdict of unlawful killing.<\/p><p>The term &quot;unlawful killing&quot; comes to my mind when I read elements of the original Keane inquiry.  I am going to quote a few of them.  Conclusion 9.25 stated: &quot;The use of carpet tiles on the walls of the ballroom and the main entrance foyer was a breach of the requirements of the Chief Fire Officer.&quot;  Conclusion 9.29 found: &quot;The electrical installation was also defective in a number of respects: in particular, trunking lids were not fitted in several areas and conduit fittings were missing.&quot;  Conclusion 9.31 stated: &quot;There were a number of serious failures to comply with the Fire Protection Standards of the Department of the Environment.&quot;  Conclusion 9.41 found: &quot;The locking and chaining of one of the emergency exits was the result of a policy initiated by Mr Eamon Butterly of having all the emergency exits locked and chained until midnight at the earliest.&quot;  Conclusion 9.42 stated: &quot;This policy was pursued by Mr Butterly with a reckless disregard for the safety of the people on the premises.&quot;  Conclusion 9.47 found that: &quot;Had the appropriate precautions been in existence to ensure an efficient evacuation on the night of the fire, the injuries sustained would have been unquestionably less and the death toll would almost certainly have been reduced.&quot;  Those are conclusions from the Keane report.<\/p><p>I believe it is reprehensible that 70 alterations were made to the original Coffey report.  The one key change, which has been mentioned already, was in paragraph 5.13, which reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>I accept that this is profoundly unsatisfactory to the survivors and the bereaved.  I also accept the Committee&rsquo;s submission that such was the scale of the disaster that it has become a matter of communal if not national history to an extent that engages a public interest in ensuring that the public record of what happened is factually accurate and established by evidence.  I further accept that a new Inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence.<\/blockquote><p>How did that change to what the Government has recorded here tonight?  The Minister said that it would not be in the public interest.  I believe we should accept the basis of the new evidence that has come forward from the families and from Ms Geraldine Foy.  The Department of Justice and Equality should bring it forward, take responsibility for it and bring it to a commission of investigation.  It should not kick it down the road as a Coffey report II type of thing.  It should not push it down the road.  We cannot be sitting here in six months time asking where that report is and how far it has gone.  Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn.  Hell will have no fury like a community's scorn if the Government does not respond positively and quickly to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500056#GGG00400","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1485375000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to address this very important debate.  Next month marks the 36th anniversary of one of the worst tragedies in Irish history that claimed the lives of 48 young people who went out to celebrate St. Valentine's Day but never came home.  For as long as I have been involved in politics, both locally and nationally, I have worked with the Stardust survivors and their families to bring about justice and, more importantly, truth to deal with this tragic chapter.  I welcome all of the families in the Visitors Gallery.  I give a commitment of my total support.  The survivors and their families, as well as many of their friends and supporters, deserve nothing less than answers to how their loved ones died.  That is what we are trying to do tonight with our amendment.<\/p><p>It is important we say it.  I also strongly agree with many of the speakers and with colleagues that locking, and putting chains on, the doors was absolutely criminal.<\/p> <p> Let us look at the facts and deal with them in regard to the amendment before the House tonight.  An independent legal expert will examine the new evidence and outstanding questions of the families and survivors before a commission is established.  There will be a judge on this with strong criminal law experience.  All the new evidence will be looked at and examined very closely.  In partnership with the Stardust families we are now on the road to getting the answers many of us have demanded for years.  For example, some speakers made reference to the evidence of Ms Brenda Kelly.  This will be looked at and examined very closely.<\/p> <p> Let us also go into the details of what is actually in the amendment.   There are some very significant points in it.  The amendment notes that in the 35 years since the Stardust tragedy in which 48 people died and 214 people were injured, families and relatives of victims of the tragedy have never received full and complete answers as to what occurred on the night of 14 February 1981.  That is accepted.  The amendment also notes that the Stardust relatives and victims committee has continually attempted to liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality and with the Taoiseach regarding their misgivings around previous investigations.  That is accepted.  I acknowledge the great work done by individual researchers into the causes of the tragedy, on a voluntary basis, over many years.  We intend to deal with that particular issue also.  The programme for Government states full regard will be given to hearing any new evidence that emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at the Stardust.  The amendment before the House calls on the Government to meet the Stardust relatives and victims committee regarding the new and updated evidence uncovered since reviewing Judge Keane's Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry on the Fire at the Stardust in 2006 and to have that new evidence assessed urgently by an independent person who has the trust of the families.  The families will be directly involved in that process.  If the independent assessment confirms the existence of new evidence, the amendment calls on the Government to immediately establish a commission of investigation into the Stardust tragedy of 1981.  There is no kicking the can down the road.  We are trying to move on this as quickly as possible.  One cannot put a price on the lives of 48 people.  This Government is committed to a commission of investigation if new evidence is found.  The money will be made available.<\/p> <p> It is also very important that tonight's debate and the amendment moves this process forward.  Earlier in the debate Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe asked why there had been no prosecutions and I totally agree.  It is absolutely disgraceful, but I suspect that at the time many of the laws and regulations were not strong enough.  That is not acceptable but I believe that is the answer to Deputy Crowe's question.  Since the Stardust tragedy Ireland has seen very clear improvements in that regard.  My own personal concern, and I felt very strongly for many years that it was not highlighted enough, was that the 1981 Garda investigation found no credible cause or location of the ignition.  The other issue was that there was no evidence of arson as investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was the fire, the heat and the toxic gases that caused the deaths and injuries.  What about the unlawful first floor, the storeroom and the concealed fuel? Were combustible materials illegally concealed behind wooden partitions?  Did anybody investigate the illegal first floor? These are all the issues I am raising tonight.  Did anybody sift through the debris and ashes of the first floor storeroom concrete floor?  Were people dead from toxic fumes, overcome by carbon monoxide, before the burning seat was spotted in the west alcove?  These are my concerns and the issues.<\/p> <p> I want to give a commitment to the families and to all the people and urge Deputies to look at the details and the wording in the amendment.  We are trying to move this process forward in the interests of truth and justice.  There is no kicking the can down the road.  We are trying to do our best for the families and I urge all Members to support us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500056#GGG00500","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485375600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank the Members on the opposite side of the House, in particular Deputy Thomas P. Broughan, for raising this matter and for the contributions made to the discussions this evening.  The appalling circumstances of the tragedy at the Stardust have been recounted with very strong emotions; even after all these years the emotion still comes through.  The magnitude of the event and its legacy continues to shock and haunt us all.  While words may be of little consequence I wish to express my deep and continuing sympathy to all those who have felt the impact of these tragic events and to recognise that members of those families are here this evening.<\/p><p>Much has been said tonight and I understand the Government of the day based its actions on the final report of Mr. Coffey and the contents of that final report were his, and his alone.  There was a necessity to correct the record and another commission could have happened if no other way of correcting the record was found.  The record of the tribunal was corrected by the two Houses agreeing a motion.  That was agreed at the time and the record was corrected.  There is no secret suggestion of the commission as such, it was about correcting the record.  This evening's debate is about how we can proceed - as it is proposed in the programme for Government - by putting in place appropriate arrangements that might help to deal with any new evidence that may have emerged.  <\/p><p>I was very taken with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's contribution to this debate and his strong expertise in the area.  He said that commissions of inquiry can be cold places.  The Government has recognised the strength of the concerns that have been expressed on this matter.  For this reason it is proposed that an independent person who has the trust of those affected and who is really experienced be appointed to assess any new evidence as to the cause of the fire before we go down the road of a bells and whistles investigation or independent commission.  As the Minister outlined, if the independent assessment by a trusted and experienced person who has the trust of the families confirms the existence of new evidence, a commission of investigation will be established and the Government will proceed as outlined in the amendment.  I believe that is probably the best and most respectful way to proceed at this point in time.  Let someone who is trusted, experienced and independent assess the evidence and bring forward a recommendation; either the new evidence justifies a full blown commission of investigation or it does not.  We do not want to go in to a cul-de-sac without real <i>prima facie <\/i>evidence.  Deputy O'Callaghan's observations are true; these commissions are cold places.  There was much justifiable and understandable emotion tonight which I felt as I listened to everyone and in picturing what happened.  It is appalling, awful and tragic.  We must, however, proceed properly and it will happen if an independent and trusted person says it is the way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500057#HHH00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1485375600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Deputy Clare Daly is sharing her time with Deputy Thomas P.

Broughan read the list of names of the victims of the tragedy on that appalling night, a real chill descended over the Chamber.  That is why we are here.  I salute his efforts and his ongoing work to get justice for the victims and their families.  It has been a long and often bitter battle by the community and it has shone a light on the failure of the State over 36 years to get answers.  It looks like tonight is going to be a continuation of that failure.  That is not good enough.  This community and the families have still not got the truth and not one person has been held accountable for what happened on that horrific night.  That is why we are here.  We are here because the other inquiries did not deliver that.  Other Deputies explained very clearly that the Keane tribunal not only did not get justice but served to blame the victims and served to be used.  His report said that there was no evidence of the fire being started deliberately but then concluded that arson was responsible.  How could that be and what did that achieve?  I will tell the House what it achieved.<\/p><p>For Mr. Eamon Butterly, it achieved more than &euro;500,000 in compensation and a placing of the blame for this horrific tragedy on the victims.  This is the same Eamon Butterly whose mismanagement and reckless policies were pinpointed in the Coffey report in 2008, which noted that had the venue exits been unlocked and unobstructed, people could have exited in a safe and timely manner.  In other words, the Coffey report clearly stated the fire should not have happened.<\/p> <p> Almost ten years later, however, nobody has been held to account.  Twelve years ago, a nightclub fire in Buenos Aires in which close to 200 young people died led to the promoter being sentenced under criminal negligence charges.  Seven years ago, in Bangkok, 67 young people died in a similar tragedy.  In that case, the owner of the nightclub was charged and imprisoned, with 12 others.  Three years ago, in Brazil, 200 people died in a tragic nightclub fire, as a consequence of which the owners were convicted of negligent homicide.  Thirty-six years after the Stardust fire, despite all the evidence of criminal negligence, nobody has been held to account.  The Government can dress its proposal up however it likes but it serves only to delay matters.<\/p> <p> It is an affront to all of us that this proposal is being delivered by a coalition of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, sadly supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  These are the same parties that were in power for the past 36 years and have seen all the reports.  The only reason this motion is on the business of the House today is that Deputy Broughan pushed for its inclusion.  Opposition Deputies' speaking time is very limited; our group gets an opportunity once a D&aacute;il term.  It is only because Deputy Broughan chose to prioritise this issue that we have an opportunity to discuss it today.<\/p> <p> This House has agreed to the establishment of commissions of investigation in the past.  The last D&aacute;il agreed to do so in respect of the \"Grace\" foster abuse case, but that commission has not even been set up yet.  The pre-inquiry the Government is proposing was conducted almost ten years ago and the person who did it, Mr. Justice Coffey, recommended at the time that there be a public inquiry.  I urge the Government to revise its stance on this issue.  It has until tomorrow to deliver, and further delaying tactics are not good enough.  People want the truth and they want accountability, as has been achieved in other jurisdictions.  The horror arising from this tragedy runs deep.  I have spoken to Leinster House staff who were young people in Dublin at the time of the tragedy.  The legacy persists and it will not end until there is a full inquiry.  I appeal to the Government to change tack at this late stage and support Deputy Broughan's motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500057#HHH00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485376200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues in Independents 4 Change, the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party for supporting the call for an investigation into the Stardust tragedy under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  I am disappointed by Fianna F&aacute;il's response to the motion but even more disappointed by the response of the Government, particularly in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  It was following a consultation process with the Stardust families that Mr. Justice Coffey was appointed to conduct a new inquiry into the tragedy.  Having considered all of the evidence and reviewed the Keane report transcripts, Mr. Justice Coffey definitively concluded, as my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, illustrated in his contribution, that  a commission of investigation was necessary.<\/p><p>I said on Leaders' Questions some months ago that the Department of Justice and Equality continued to stonewall on the clear and obvious need for the establishment of a commission of investigation under the 2004 Act.  We have more of the same this evening.  The private investigations that were carried out since the late 1990s show the Keane tribunal was profoundly mistaken in its conclusion, much crucial eye witness evidence was missed and there were serious shortcomings in the forensic examination by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the then Department of Justice.  The body of research and new evidence presented by Ms Geraldine Foy, Mr. Robin Knox and others includes details of the use of inaccurate buildings plans in the Keane inquiry process, the existence of a store room with access to the roof loaded with inflammable cooking oil and aerosols, long-standing electrical and heating system safety issues, including arcing and overloading, earlier external sightings of the fire in the roof space from 1.30 a.m., the wave of heat from the ceiling felt by disco goers and staff, and new evidence pointing very strongly to ignition in the ceiling area.  There is enough evidence there to bring a commission of investigation into existence.  Deputy O'Callaghan emphasised the powers and <i>modus operandi<\/i>of such commissions.  That is precisely what the people in my constituency want, namely, an investigative body which can ensure, at long last, that they will have justice, peace and closure.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity to pay warm tribute to Ms Antoinette Keegan, Ms Chrissie Keegan and their colleagues who have worked so hard, so diligently and for so long on this project for justice.  Besides engaging in the collection of new evidence and their interactions with this House, they attempted, in late 2011, to bring the Stardust case before the European Court of Human Rights under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the right to life.  The 48 victims of the Stardust tragedy were, they rightly claimed, denied the most fundamental right of all.  The plaintiffs argued in the two cases against Ireland that the convention had been breached due to deficiencies in the investigation into the deaths.  That case did not continue simply on time grounds.<\/p><p>On 23 June 2016, I again, during Leaders' Questions, raised the need for a commission of investigation.  Once more, the T&aacute;naiste engaged in a stonewalling exercise and repeated the mantra of a need for new evidence, notwithstanding all the important new facts that have been supplied.  As several colleagues noted, those who attended the Stardust nightclub on that fateful night were almost all in the 18 to 25 age cohort, with the average age being 19.  Now, 36 years later, they are in their mid-50s to mid-60s, while some other important witnesses are much older.  The commission must be established as soon as possible in order that everybody can be heard again and we can finally achieve closure and justice.  In response to a series of parliamentary questions tabled by me, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which she described as complex, and emphasised that she could do nothing which might undercut it.  However, the very existence of that investigation reflects the huge range of unanswered questions, unassessed and missed evidence, and the profound deficiencies of the Keane tribunal investigation.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about the possibility of reopening the coroner's inquest into the deaths of the 48 young people, to which I received a standard reply that inquests were held in early March 1982 under the Coroners Act and pointing out that the coroner exercises quasi-judicial functions and that she, the T&aacute;naiste, has no role in individual cases.  In October last year, I wrote again to the Dublin City Coroner asking that the inquest be reopened and what information would be required in order to do so.  Dr. Myra Cullinane stated in her reply:<\/p><blockquote>These inquests were held before a jury and presided over by the then Dublin City Coroner, Professor Bofin.  I have therefore no jurisdiction to reopen these inquests in the above circumstances.<\/blockquote><p>What are the circumstances in which the inquests could be reopened?<\/p><p>It is incomprehensible to me that we are still seeking justice and closure on this matter.  In preparing for today's motion, I revisited my many files on the Stardust tragedy.  When one reviews the timeline of events and the litany of instances of grievous treatment of the victims' families and subsequently the victims committee, one cannot help but feel great anger and frustration on their behalf.  What we should all be feeling is empathy.  If any member of our own family had been directly affected by this tragedy, we would react with great anger and determination.  In October last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, presented a submission to the Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, entitled &quot;Insults towards the Stardust 48 Fatal Victims&quot;.  There have been 36 years of insults to the 48 young people who lost their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500058#JJJ00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1485376200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500058#JJJ00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485376200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>If not for the valiant and tenacious work of the grieving families, none of the positive actions of the campaign for justice would have come about, the finding of arson would not have been expunged, the Stardust Memorial Park would not exist, the five unnamed bodies would have remain unidentified, and even the Government's offer of a rerun of a Coffey-type investigation would not be on the table tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500058#JJJ00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1485376800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to conclude.

The office was established on an administrative basis in 2014.  It is charged with leading the shared services strategy and the implementation of such projects and operations within the overall public service reform and renewal context across the Civil Service.  Government investment in shared services has been significant, with &euro;28.5 million capital funding provided to date, reflecting the importance of this as a cross-cutting transformation initiative under the public service reform programme of 2011.<\/p>  <p>  It is of the greatest importance to me and the Government that our work has a positive impact on the public.  I believe shared services in the Civil Service is doing just that, by creating one team which takes daily operational functions common to all Departments such as finance and human resources and transforming them through process standardisation, in other words, by seeking to come up with a common way of doing important actions that are done tens of thousands of times per week or month across the Civil Service, and system consolidation in order that it is all done in one system or a smaller number of systems, with higher levels of automation and self-service.  All of this is to allow Departments and civil servants to focus on their core business of providing better front-line services to citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I have had the opportunity to visit the three main centres within which the shared services functions are located in Tullamore, Killarney and Clonskeagh.  When one goes into these centres, one sees areas within these offices where all of the pensions to those who used to work in the Civil Services are being paid or one sees salary queries for all of the Civil Service with a few exceptions - I hope we will be able to bring all organisations on board across 2017 and 2018 - being dealt with within one office.  This delivers savings to the State and allows us to do important work better and more efficiently.  This will, in time, allow more cost-effective custom solutions and will ensure we are not duplicating effort across Departments.  It will lower the costs of technology and allow staff who are involved in this work to do important work more effectively and efficiently.<\/p>  <p> This a customer-focused organisation.  The centres themselves are staffed by civil servants who are becoming specialists in best-practice standards of non-core support services such as HR and payroll.  They operate a single standard way of working and they are able to contribute, and respond quickly, to the introduction of new policies, such as the recently introduced paternity leave scheme.  Furthermore, because data is consolidated and held centrally and standardised, it creates better insights for policy makers and provides improved management information for decision making.  When compared with international standards, and indeed when compared with standards in the private sector both in Ireland and abroad, the State has made significant progress in a relatively short timeframe in delivering a really ambitious plan.  This is all a result of strong support from both the Government and senior managers and leaders within the Civil Service.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for this office is to consolidate shared services into one office with better focus on the customer and an improved service culture, and to have this separate to the broad-ranging policy making functions of my Department.  Establishing the NSSO as a separate entity will enable my Department to move away from operational matters and prioritise expenditure and budgetary policy over shared services.  However, the Bill is clear that I, in my capacity as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will retain the key supervisory role, empowering me to appoint and remove the chief executive, and allowing me, when necessary, to give direction to the office.  Furthermore, the chief executive will be fully accountable to the Oireachtas, answering on service, quality, benefits and value for money.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made.  The human resources and pensions administration shared services centre for the Civil Service has been in operation since March 2013.  When the annual running costs are extracted, the saving in the cost of the delivery of transactional human resources was estimated at &euro;3.7 million across the first three groups of Departments and offices that migrated to this new service.  It now provides HR and pensions administration services for 34,500 public servants across 39 Departments and offices and employs over 300 staff.<\/p>  <p>  The single payroll shared service centre, PSSC, for the Civil Service, which began operating in December 2013, now services 43 organisations and has 102,000 payees, including 57,000 retirees.  Last year, the PSSC made over 2.7 million payments to the value of &euro;3.24 billion.  This figure is set to rise in the current year.  The PSSC replaces 18 payroll centres that had different versions of payroll systems, which previously cost &euro;21.4 million to provide payroll, pension, travel and subsistence payments.  The business case estimates an annual cost when fully operational of nearly &euro;16 million.<\/p><p> The development of a new finance technology solution for Government has also begun.  The introduction of a single finance technology platform will replace 31 existing finance systems across Departments and offices and facilitate transaction processing in the financial management shared service centre.  The centre which is scheduled to start providing financial management services in 2018 will use common technology and standardised procedures to deliver core financial management services to 48 identified Government organisations, all of which will be on board by 2020.  It is expected to yield a sustainable reduction in the annual cost of finance of approximately &euro;15.4 million through a reduction in the cost of support for finance technology and a reduction in the head count, equal to 145 full-time equivalents, required to provide financial management processing services.  This will make a big contribution to fulfilling the dual mandate of managing expenditure and reforming the way in which we deliver services.  It will deliver tangible improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government&rsquo;s central finance function, which includes the processing of finance transactions such as payment of invoices, processing of receipts, fixed asset accounting, as well as the general ledger and appropriation accounts which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p> Research shows that service delivery and high quality customer services are most effective where implementation is separate from policy making.  For greater effectiveness, the NSSO requires the flexibility to respond quickly to operational matters.  This is not always possible within an environment of measured pace and focus on policy making, as within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Added to that, the demand on my Department from the NSSO is significant.  In 2017, with an estimated 780 staff, the NSSO will be twice the size of the manpower of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Creating the NSSO as a separate office also provides for the independence of shared service governance.  It ensures clear accountability structures delivered through individual service agreements with public service bodies, which specify the terms and conditions upon which services are to be provided.  Further to this, and in anticipation of the enactment of the Bill, the NSSO is formalising and modifying its current governance arrangements with the establishment of the NSSO board, as provided for in the Bill.  A separate customer services group will be also established to oversee shared services performance across the service management framework.<\/p> <p> Turning to the Bill, the legislation provides for the office to carry out corporate administrative functions on behalf of a public service body.  The legislation will specify the chief executive officer of the NSSO as Accounting Officer.  The NSSO board, which will have an advisory remit, is also provided for in the legislation.  The Bill is set out in five Parts.<\/p> <p> Part 2 allows for the practical structures in the establishment of the national shared services office.  It confers on the office all such powers that are necessary in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p> Part 3 is concerned with the establishment, membership and functions of the board.<\/p> <p> Parts 4 and 5 contain technical provisions dealing with transitional arrangements, and consequential and miscellaneous provisions.<\/p> <p> I look forward to hearing the contributions from Members.  It always has been envisaged that the NSSO would become independent in the delivery of its functions.  Shared services is the biggest cross-Government change the Civil Service has experienced.  I acknowledge that this type of project is not without risk.  The statutory establishment of the NSSO will help us to meet the requirements of international best practice in this area.  These requirements include clear accountability arrangements, clear funding arrangements, an appropriate degree of operational autonomy and a strong focus on the customer.  I am sure the House will find that, with five shared service centres operational across the breadth of Government and others planned in the next few years, Ireland has an ambitious plan for investment in shared services.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the guidance, support and direction from the members of the shared services steering board and programme boards to the NSSO.  Their sponsorship and work have been instrumental in assisting the delivery of this ambitious programme of work and bringing it to this point.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500059#KKK01600","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485377400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Deputy Dara Calleary is sharing time with Deputy Sean Fleming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500060#LLL00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485377400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill, which provides for the establishment of the national shared services office on a statutory basis.  The office currently exists on an administrative basis within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Shared services is the provision of common corporate services to a number of organisations by an independent service provider that previously were carried out by each organisation separately.  It reduces the duplication of effort by consolidating transactional functions, such as finance, payroll and human resources, and ICT to enable quicker access to data and improved data quality through increased standardisation, specialisation, automation and control.  As both private and public sector experiences internationally illustrate, the value of shared services include: direct cost savings and efficiency; the provision of better management information to enhance decision making; and, most importantly, the freeing up of senior management resources to focus on policy development and service delivery. However, any Bill presented by this Government to establish another quango brings to mind the promises made by the parties in the general election campaign in 2011, when they effectively promised a bonfire of quangos.  Now, a new agency is being established to do this important work.  Second, listening to the Minister's remarks one would think nothing had been done about shared services prior to 2013.  The centres the Minister mentioned, particularly Killarney and Tullamore, were established in 2008 and 2009, and a considerable amount of work was under way towards achieving this aim prior to 2011.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of concerns that must be dealt with.  I welcome some of the provision in the legislation, although we will discuss them further on Committee Stage.  In recent years we have seen a constant and regular pattern, not so much in the public service but in private sector pay delivery, of payment failures by either banks or the paying agency.  We must ensure that in combining all the services in shared services, particularly with regard to payment, it has the best quality information technology to ensure people are paid on time and when they are expected to be paid.  They cannot be left short of their wages because of a shared services collapse.  It is important that the investment in facilities and services continues to be as reliable as it is today for the public service, and that the creation of one agency does not result in a focus on costs at the cost of delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Second, shared services and the information it provides should be used to enhance the public and civil service.  It should not be used to drive a procurement policy that shies away from supporting local business.  Procurement and procurement savings are important, but until we use procurement as a tool for job maintenance and job creation for SMEs and local suppliers, we will not use it most effectively.  The use of shared services information to drive a procurement policy that is in favour of big suppliers would be wrong and would go against a proper and socially responsible procurement policy.<\/p>  <p>  We must also ensure that, in taking down the silos between back office functions within Departments, we direct that culture to service delivery functions.  The Minister will be used to hearing me say that.  It is a sentiment he shares.  It is ridiculous to have different policies in so many areas, involving the journeys of so many citizens, from Departments that contradict each other.  The Department of Health will always contradict the Department of Education and Skills, which, in turn, will contradict the Department of Health.  The silo nature of Government must be broken down in the services and delivery of services for children with additional needs and in many other areas.  We must put our citizens and their needs first, and make easy the difficult journeys in life of citizens who face challenges for which they are not responsible.  The silo nature should be broken down not just behind the office but also at the front of the office.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>In providing shared services for civil and public servants, we must also provide shared and cohesive services for the people who use those services.<\/p> <p> I want to ensure there is accountability from the organisation directly to the Oireachtas.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to do that.  We cannot have a situation in which when public representatives here in the Oireachtas or at local level try to get information on behalf of those we serve, we are blocked by reason of data control or the agency not being answerable to the Oireachtas.  That day has to go.  Every Government agency in receipt of funding, particularly an agency that is twice the size of the Minister's Department, must be answerable to the Oireachtas and its Members, regardless of who is in government.<\/p> <p> With those reservations and remarks, we are happy to support the Bill.  We will work through Committee Stage to enhance and strengthen the safety around the Bill.  Shared services and the provision of salary and pension payments in particular is a very serious operation and cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of those who want to deliver it on a \"yellow pack\" basis or on the basis of any less of the value than it means.  We must ensure the establishment of the authority does not, knowingly or unknowingly, allow for that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500060#LLL00300","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485378000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, in the debate on the legislation.  As he has indicated, we agree with the Bill in principle and will support anything needed to improve services and efficiencies across the public service and the Civil Service, in particular.  It goes without saying we will have a detailed discussion on Committee Stage, when the points my colleague has mentioned will be teased out in detail.  It is important that the Minister be open to any practical, sensible amendments made during the course of the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I will tease out some issues, although the Minister may not get an opportunity to answer before the Second Stage debate is completed.  If he has answers by the time we reach Committee Stage, it will be adequate, given that it will take place before the passage of the legislation.  We would like to see a detailed financial plan for the office to give us an indication of the break-even period.  We have had various discussions about the shared payroll service that exists in the public service.  During the first few years, there was quite an amount of up-front  investment in capital, staff, training, building and equipment for a number of years.  Savings will occur in Departments as time goes on once the functions transfer.  How long will it take the service to break even?  While it is fine to say it will save money, will it be after two, three, four, five or six years?  People are entitled to know this level of detail in order that we can examine it from a business case point of view.<\/p><p>We will need to see the details of the cost savings in terms of staff.  If the work is being done centrally, it means it is not being carried out in the individual Departments and, by definition, the staff who carried out the work in the individual Departments will be free for redeployment.  In the Minister's opening statement, he said it would lead to a reduction in headcount - I do not like that phrase when we are talking about public servants - of 145.  Does the Minister mean there will be a reduction in public service numbers or that 145 people will be free to improve the quality of service in their parents Departments?  This needs to be clarified.  Many public service bodies could do with an improvement in service, given the reduction in staff numbers during recent years.<\/p><p>One of my concerns about going down this road is that when everything is centralised there will be a temptation for some future Minister to outsource it all in one go to the private sector.  The Minister will have to give a commitment on this.  In commercial sectors, we see that major institutions outsource many of their back office procedures to the private service.  When it is all consolidated in one spot, it is very easy to outsource it.  While I know this is not the Minister's intention at this stage and I do not see it happening in the immediate future, it would make it very easy for it to happen down the road.  The Government could contract some of it out, then more of it and, suddenly, the office is just a procurement service for outsourcing services.  We must guard against this and ensure there is something in the legislation to deal with it.<\/p><p>On the one hand, the Minister told us it would be independent, while, on the other, he said he would have a supervisory role.  Next, he will tell us there will be a board over it, and then he will tell us he will be able to hire and fire the chief executive.  I am not sure whether it is independent.  I would favour not complete independence, given that we live in a democracy and people should be answerable to the Oireachtas, to which people are elected to represent the public.  On the question of accountability, will the Minister specify whether it will be an Accounting Officer, a chief executive or an accountable officer.  &quot;Accountable officer&quot; is a new phrase coming into the public service, which refers to a person who is not quite an Accounting Officer but who is wheeled out to answer questions or, sometimes, not answer questions, as the case may be.<\/p><p>Will there be a board?  Who will appoint the board?  Will it go through the Public Appointments Service?  Will the board appoint the chief executive, or will be Minister do it?  There is a detailed section on accountability to the Oireachtas and I want the Minister to make it very clear.  There will be a section in the legislation saying the chief executive will be accountable to an Oireachtas committee, as the case may be.  However, this will mean there will be no accountability by way of parliamentary question.  We went through this debacle with Irish Water.  It was said that it would be answerable to the Oireachtas.  However, once it was up and running it was not really answerable and did not answer parliamentary questions.  The Health Service Executive does not answer any parliamentary questions asked here.  If we put down a parliamentary question, the Minister passes it on to the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.  By taking this route, the accountability to the Oireachtas is broken.<\/p><p>It is important that whoever is accountable from the new organisation be accountable to the line committee of the Minister's Department and, separately, to the Committee of Public Accounts.  All these public bodies that are fully publicly funded for public services should be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  They should be separately accountable, regarding their operations, policy and procedures, to the direct line committee.  It would not be right if the committee on public expenditure and reform had no access to it, if it were confined to the Committee of Public Accounts, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is important that we achieve this.<\/p><p>Under the Minister's Department there is the Office of Government Procurement.  Will the new office link in with this office in due course or will there be two separate quangos?  In a way, they are different aspects of it, however there are probably similarities in what the Minister is trying to achieve, namely savings across Departments, co-ordination of knowledge and information and better value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  Is it planned that these would merge somewhere down the road or is it an issue for another day?<\/p><p>We have mentioned the facility in Clonskeagh, PeoplePoint, and the payroll shared service.  So far, this affects only the Civil Service, and the line Departments which include 30,000 to 40,000 people.  The local authorities have been using shared services for quite some time.  A particular expertise has been built up in County Laois through Laois County Council, which handles the MyPay system for all the local authorities through the service that is managed by the Laois county manager.  Approximately 70 staff there are managing the payroll and in the next month or two, the last of all the local authorities in Ireland will have transferred their payroll processing functions, including superannuation, to Portlaoise.  This can be extended further to HR and other issues as time goes on.  Will this link in with the office?  Where does the NSSO brief begin and end?  Will it extend to the public service?  I do not think the Minister is dealing with the Civil Service in isolation.<\/p><p>I am concerned when I see the NSSO dealing in the Civil Service and, probably, extending into the public service.  Will it ultimately take control of the shared services in the local authorities?  I would like assurances, from a Laois perspective.  The Government has invested heavily in a system which is working exceptionally well in Portlaoise and is an example of how the new office should operate.  The numbers in the local authority are equally as big as the Civil Service.  I would not like the NSSO to take over the work being carried out in Portlaoise under the jurisdiction of the Laois chief executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500061#MMM00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1485378600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>He wants it to be decentralised to Portlaoise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500062#NNN00100","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1485378600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>We would be happy for some additional work from the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, to be carried out in Portlaoise and see if it would operate effectively.  It would be terrible for the autonomy of local government if shared service work at local government level was to be taken over by the NSSO.  Local authorities have taken the lead when it comes to shared services in areas such as waste management and the processing of permits and housing loan applications.  I would not like to see this work subsumed into a national office under the supervision of a Minister and removed from the local authority structure.  I would like to see a commitment given on that issue before the legislation is passed.<\/p>  <p>  The principle and the idea behind the Bill are good.  However, there are several matters of concern.  We need to see a timetable for when it is proposed to break even.  What will happen to the staff who will no longer be required?  Will they be redeployed for good effort rather than reducing the headcount?  Now that the work will all be captured in the one office, we want to put measures in place to ensure it will not be contracted out to the private sector at the expense of a good public service which has been doing the job up to now, but perhaps this might be a more efficient way.

It will be supporting its passage to Committee Stage.  There has been little public commentary on the Bill since it was first announced by the previous Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in January 2016.  This always gives cause for concern, especially when dealing with a Bill which potentially has significant implications for the operation of several services across Departments and public bodies.  On the face of it, it seems benign.  In policy terms, its context is the reform of the public sector and who could be opposed to reform of the public sector?  The objective stated in the action plan for public sector reform is &ldquo;to continue to envision, launch, grow and transform public value through shared services programme&rdquo;.  How can anyone be against a plan which sets out to grow and transform public value?  Of course, we would support such a move.  I welcome this and any measure which will bring clarity to employment levels in the public service, as well as wage levels.<\/p><p>When I was appointed Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on public expenditure and reform, I met the Minister in the first week.  At that meeting I asked him if he could assist me in getting costings for returning the public service to a single tier pay structure.  He helpfully set up a meeting for me with the Secretary General of his Department who was able to provide me with the costings for restoring allowances.  However, he was unable to provide me with costings for returning to a single tier pay structure.  He then referred me to several officials in his Department whom I met in my office and who were also unable to provide the information.  They said it was because different Departments operated different payroll systems and were unable to obtain the data which would enable them to provide the answers to my questions.  The answers were important because they had an impact on policy.  We wanted to know how much it would cost to return all those on 1 January 2011 who were stuck in a two tier parallel pay structure back to a single tier pay structure.  However, it simply could not be done and to this day we have been unable to get the costings.  If shared services were able to deal with these issues and enable Departments to get data because we had simplified shared systems, we would be supportive of it.<\/p><p>I recognise that having shared services does not mean a concentration of services in one office, but it does fall into the overall principle of improved analysis and service.  Deputy Dara Calleary referred to Departments operating in silos, of which we all have experience.  We often hear phrases trotted out such as &ldquo;cross-cutting&rdquo; and &ldquo;interdepartmental&rdquo; which are often just a cover for the fact that Departments are operating in silos in shared services and policy terms.  I agree that it is important that we move away from the silo mentality to a much greater sharing of services to achieve efficiencies.<\/p><p>International studies tend to show there are five attributes of shared services.  They comprise distinct governance, namely, a distinct organisational structure with a dedicated management team delivering the operational aspects of corporate services for one or more organisations; standard processes, namely, processes are standardised and streamlined; economies of scale, namely, scale is achieved through combining processes previously executed independently; customer driven, namely, that a culture of service delivery is ingrained within the shared services centre.  They also mean that resources are committed to key account management, monitoring key performance indicators and the achievement of service-level agreements.  There is also continuous process improvement, with dedicated project teams managing process change to drive improvements in both efficiency and levels of service.  These are all fine objectives and hard to argue against, especially in a large public service which covers different Departments and large expenditure which could potentially lead to duplication.<\/p><p>As the Bill is from the previous Administration, however, we should not take everything at face value.  On the proposed office, its function is to enter into contracts for the procurement of goods and services required for the provision of shared services.  The Government intends to give the office &ldquo;all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the office shall be independent in the performance of its functions&rdquo;.  The Bill will allow the shared services office to enter into agreements with public service bodies and draw up the terms and conditions on which shared services are to be provided for these bodies.  It will make payments to and communicate with persons on behalf of public service bodies for the purposes of providing shared services.  It will receive and process personal data provided for it by public service bodies for the purpose of carrying out its functions.  It will develop and implement policies on the manner in which shared services are to be provided.  It will provide guidance, where appropriate, in the public sector on the provision of services comparable to shared services.  That is quite the transfer of power to an independent body.<\/p><p>What does the Bill mean by a shared service?  It states:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;Shared services&rdquo; means common or combined services provided to more than one public service body, the provision of which (to the public service bodies concerned) enables, assists or facilitates the carrying out of any administrative task or process necessary for or incidental to the performance of a function, specified in Schedule 2, of those public service bodies.<\/blockquote><p>The areas of responsibility which will be transferred cover employment contracts, wages, pensions and financial accounts.  The office will cover 40 public bodies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Courts Service, the Office of the President, the Revenue Commissioners, the Defence Forces, the Road Safety Authority, the State Laboratory and the State Examinations Commission.  That means that a lot of sensitive data will be put out to tender.  This has to be a concern, especially the information on personnel within the legal and judicial system.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that the public service managerial concept of the shared service office is relatively new.  It began in the 1980s in the private sector and crept its way into the public sector from the mid-1990s onwards under the banners of innovation, transformation and efficiency.  A 2013 International Centre for Local and Regional Development report stated, &quot;Shared services working together for the common good have found that shared services offices do not always realise the planned benefits in terms of costs and efficiencies&quot;.<\/p><p>These studies have found issues such as higher costs, loss of focus on quality, problems associated with the use of technology and staff reductions, with a corresponding drop in public service standards.<br\/><br\/>The report also highlights the areas of interest for Governments in terms of where a shared service office can go once it is up and running.  To date, shared services in the State have tended to focus on administrative services but that can change.  In its 2013 report, the ICLRD wrote the following about the State: <\/p><blockquote>With the emphasis on &lsquo;back-office&rsquo; shared services to date, much of the collaborative working across central and local government has been in the spheres of Human Resources (HR), finance, procurement and ICT.  The growing interest in exploring the options for a shored services agenda within front-line services is resulting in other services coming into play.There are a growing number of instances where local and regional authorities are pooling or sharing service provision in areas such as emergency services, health administration and inspection, water and waste-water, tourism and area promotion.<\/blockquote><p>It went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>Similarly, as part of the ICLRD Executive Training Programme (in 2011) with the ten Councils that make up the Irish Central Border Area Network (ICBAN), a working group was established on shared services.  This was made up of senior management within local government, representing both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland - including Chief Executives, County Managers and Directors of Service.  This group identified potential areas where shared services may be feasible; these included: emergency services\/planning; training and capacity building; arts, heritage and culture; recreation services; and environmental and technical services.<\/blockquote><p>What we have here is a high-level group being set up in 2011 to discuss the roll-out of a shared services programme in the State that will focus on back-room operations at first, as the Bill before us does, before eventually moving on to front-line services, including emergency services, tourism, health inspection and administration.  As to where the Bill will lead us, we are not yet sure for certain, but we can clearly see that it lays down a structure that could easily allow for a more comprehensive and wide-ranging roll-out of shared services under the administration of this new office.  There is no doubt in my mind that the ambitions of the Fine Gael Government, the Fine Gael Party and the Minister's Department do not end with the back-room operations presented in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  This becomes clear when we look at the checks and balances or lack thereof.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of oversight, the Bill allows the Minister to &quot;give general directions in writing to the Office for any purpose in relation to the functions of the Office under this Act or for any other purpose in relation to the provisions of this Act, or any other enactment&quot;.  I have a concern with the phrase &quot;general directions&quot;.  We know from NAMA and the Department of Finance that &quot;general directions&quot; is interpreted by the State as meaning, in effect, no direction.  This is a hands-off approach where the board members of the shared services office will be given potentially free rein to implement policy as they see fit, with strategies drawn and put into place that involve public money but not public oversight.  The board will be able to hire consultants and advisers as it sees fit.  We know from past experience that they can very easily turn into a gravy train for private companies.  There is no provision for a fee cap for consultants in the shared services office.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that.  The board will be given a statutory power to pay consultants whatever it likes.  The Bill says &quot;Any fees payable to a consultant or adviser shall, having regard to guidelines issues from time to time by the Minister, be paid by the Office out of moneys at its disposal&quot;.  Guidelines, as with general directions, are nothing when compared to the statutory powers of a board.  Here, as with NAMA and Irish Water, to name but two, the board will triumph.  <br\/><br\/>That leads us to another issue.  The shared services office will be set up as a stand-alone company.  The practice and precedent under Irish law is that when a public company has both a social and a commercial remit, the commercial side wins through.  Even if the policy and direction of the shared services office ends up having negative social effects, it will not be taken into account as much as the narrow balance sheet view of the commercial side.  This is the case with NAMA as well as Irish Water, which are both registered as stand-alone companies.  Even as NAMA sits on unused rezoned land across the State and in doing so causes social damage to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro, as long as the board, in its wisdom, believes its commercial side is serviced by land hoarding, then as far as the State is concerned, the hoarding is justified.  This is the type of logic that has been written into the National Shared Services Office Bill.<br\/><br\/>We have a Bill before us that is focused on establishing an independent office, which in the Irish State means little to no real public oversight.  That has been people's experience of many of these so-called independent offices.  It will be mandated to facilitate the contracting of shared services around traditional back-room operations such as salaries, pensions, and financial accounts.  Once it is up and running, it could easily see itself dealing with more so-called front-line operations and moving into areas such as emergency services, health administration and inspection, water and waste-water, tourism and area promotion.<br\/><br\/>We are giving the Bill a cautious welcome and are taking a wait-and-see approach.  We will be supporting the Bill and its passage through Second Stage.  I look forward to the Minister's response to my contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500062#NNN00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485379200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht na deise labhairt ar an mBille seo anocht.  As my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has outlined, we are giving qualified support to the Bill.  We have some concerns, which Deputy Cullinane has outlined.  In terms of education, there are benefits associated with the notion of shared services.  It has relevance to the education sector.  The education and local government sectors represent more than 40% of the Irish public service.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports any measures that will increase efficiency and reduce waste in public services.  There are many examples of areas where increased shared services would be of significant benefit in the education sector.  In particular, areas such as the roll-out of broadband ICT and the digital strategy for schools have all benefitted from shared services initiatives.  There is also scope to develop enhanced shared services in areas such as further education and training, which is managed between the State agency, SOLAS, in partnership with 16 education and training boards.  It is my view that the greater sharing of information and data between Departments and agencies in the education sector would potentially ease the administrative burden and inform more effective policy decisions.  For example, areas such as school transport, admissions and capital planning could all benefit from more comprehensive data sharing between schools and the Department on projected student numbers.  However, there are a number of concerns about the Bill.  There is a genuine fear that the Bill could pave the way for further outsourcing of elements of the public service to external bodies, raising potential issues with regard to the rights of workers and also with respect to data protection and confidentiality.<\/p>  <p>  The definition of a shared service within the context of the Bill is quite broad and leaves significant scope for the Minister and the national shared services office to determine the range of goods and services that will fall within the remit of the Bill.  This would need to be clarified on Committee Stage.  There is also a clear need to ensure there is strong accountability of the office to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and to the finance committee.  This needs to be strengthened on Committee Stage.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, I welcome the stated purpose of the Bill to improve efficiencies and look forward to working with my colleagues, particularly Deputy Cullinane, as the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage to ensure outstanding concerns are addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500063#OOO00200","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1485379200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for the contributions they have made.

Committee Stage is coming up and I will be able to do it in a little more detail then.  I will touch on some of the broad points made by Deputies and give a response to them.  We can work through each of these points in more detail on Committee Stage.  I thank colleagues for the support offered to the Bill.  That support is qualified because Deputies want to understand details of the legislation and quiz me about the implementation of policy.  Nonetheless, all of the Deputies who have spoken can see the benefits this approach can offer.<\/p><p>I welcome and acknowledge this.  Although I know Deputies are very busy, if any of them would like to visit these centres and see the work that goes on, I believe they would find it very helpful.  If Deputy Calleary or any of the Deputies were to agree to do that, I might visit Portlaoise with Deputy Fleming and to see what is under way there.<\/p> <p> Some common themes emerged from the different points raised by speakers.  The first was the concern in regard to what is the reach and growth potential of this organisation.  The concern was that if we are looking to integrate functions of up to 40 organisations by 2017, it will be difficult avoid having one massive organisation that is not accountable to the Oireachtas or a Department.  Thatr is why the lines of reporting are very clear in the Bill.  It will report to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it will then be open to the Oireachtas committee that shadows my Department and the Committee of Public Accounts to raise questions in regard to its operation.<\/p> <p> The second theme that emerged was in regard to procurement.  I have no plans, nor is my Department developing plans, to merge this organisation with the Office for Government Procurement.  We see them as having different functions and doing different pieces of work.  The sole role of this significant organisation will be to administer the different support services that are important to civil and public servants.  A phrase that was used with me in my visits to different offices was that the organisation wants to get to a point where, from the moment somebody joins the public service to the moment they stop being a retiree, all the services are available to them from a single organisation.  Whether it is in regard to being paid, the management of HR files, applying for leave, retiring or being paid in retirement, the idea is that, from the cradle to grave, all those services will be provided by a single organisation.  Of course, we are trying to do all this in a better and more effective way.  Deputy Fleming touched on the point that, within local authorities, much of these services have been brought within one local authority and it has worked well there.  The opportunity for efficiencies across so many other agencies is very significant and that is the role of this organisation.<\/p> <p> The third common point put to me was in regard to whether there was an agenda to outsource this work.  I have no such agenda and, again, my Department is not developing such an agenda.  I struggle to see the merit or benefit it would deliver.  If we are going to all this effort to put together an organisation which has all the expertise located within it and which can do the work more efficiently on its own than can be done by 40 organisations, I find it difficult to see how any private sector entity would be able to match that.  That is my view and that of the Government.  Of course, this is a matter that will be raised with me as the Bill moves through the House.<\/p> <p> The issue of data safety and integrity was specifically raised by Deputy Cullinane who said he did not want us to get to a point where data is going out to tender.  That is the last thing we are looking to achieve.  Deputy Calleary spoke about trying to avoid services being provided on a yellow pack basis, as he put it.  What we want is to be in a situation where a significant amount of information in regard to everybody who has worked, or is working, for the State is kept centrally and all the services to underpin that are run by one organisation.  I believe we will be better able to address concerns in regard to data integrity if it is managed by one group.  With regard to efficiency and quality of service, I again refer to the point made by Deputy Calleary.  We should be able to manage the process better if it is run by a single organisation.<\/p> <p> The final common point that emerged was in regard to accountability.  Again, the Bill makes very clear that the organisation will be accountable to the Oireachtas through the Oireachtas committee and, from a Government point of view, it will continue to report directly to me, as Minister, and my Department.<\/p> <p> I have touched on the common themes that were raised by Deputies and I want to move to some of the more detailed points.  Deputy Calleary raised an issue in regard to procurement and job creation.  I hope I have clarified that it is not the aim to merge the organisation into the Office of Government Procurement and that they will be separate organisations doing separate work.<\/p> <p> Deputy Fleming raised the issue of headcount.  In my opening speech, I tried to make clear, and I will clarify again, that the objective is to ensure  staff who would have been doing this work are redeployed to provide work that is central to the Department within which they are located, as opposed to providing operational support to people who are inside a Department.  The Deputy referred to the local authorities.  At this point, the office has no plans to go into the work local authorities are doing in regard to human resources.  I can offer further clarity on that as the Bill goes through Committee Stage.  The Deputy also raised the issue of contracting out, which I dealt with earlier.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cullinane raised the issue of data integrity and I hope I have dealt with it.  He also went through the broad policy background to shared services and I agree with much of what he said.  He further asked, given we are starting with a shared services approach to back office operations, what are the frontiers of my ambition.  For example, he referred to the NSSO being involved in the delivery of emergency services.  I can assure the Deputy we have no plans to go into that terrain and that what we are talking about is support services in regard to human resources.  Deputy Cullinane also referred to the processing of permits and, again, this is not an area we aim to see the NSSO go into.  I suggest to the Deputy that if we had an agenda to go into those kinds of policy areas, we would not be putting the organisation on a statutory footing because, if we were then looking to radically expand the kind of services the NSSO delivered, we would need to change primary legislation in order to do it.  It is because we are very clear on the kind of services this organisation is going to provide that we want to put it on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p> Deputy Nolan referred to the benefits she has seen within education.  I agree with that point and hope we can see that approach shared elsewhere.  She also made a point about the benefits that could be gained through the greater sharing of information and data.  She is right that this will not be a benefit the organisation will deliver in the early part of its existence because the work involved in administering these services is very large.  However, from my visits to the different centres, two things became very apparent to me.  The first is that the people involved in leading these centres have gained a huge amount of experience about how we can better set policy.<\/p><p>The roll-out of the new paternity leave is a good example in this regard.  When the paternity leave offer was made available to public servants, because we had received more feedback and information regarding how we can make leave arrangements work better, we were able to implement that policy more swiftly.  Similarly, when we get into areas such as the implementation of parts of the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements, more expertise is being developed on how we implement policies.  This is the very reason I want to ensure this organisation continues to have a firm relationship with my Department in order that we do not lose sight of that kind of learning and information.<\/p> <p> I visited Clonskeagh on Monday.  One of the team leaders involved in overseeing a particular area talked to me about the need to better operationalise policy.  What the team leader was referring to was that when we make changes regarding public policy and implement reform measures, we must be more aware of how we can make them happen.  That is what this service centre will be able to offer.  Furthermore, we will begin to generate large amounts of information regarding what goes on in transactions within our public service.  Extraordinary work is going on now in big data, a sphere in which Ireland is doing very well within Government through our open Government partnership whereby we publish whole data sets on different policy areas.  This type of approach can be used to look at all the information we will build up on the operation of transactions within the public service and Civil Service.  This might well yield policy insights and learnings that we do not have at the moment.  As I said, I do not think this will happen in the early years of the operation of this organisation, but perhaps in a few years' time it will yield some rich insights into the ways in which many hundreds and thousands of people within the State live, receive payments and undertake transactions.<\/p> <p> Again, I thank the House for the qualified support that has been offered to the Bill.  I have tried to cover all the different issues that have been raised, but I will do so in more detail as the Bill moves to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500063#OOO00500","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485380400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Shared Services Office Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1485380400,"counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500065#QQQ00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1485380400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500065#QQQ00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485380400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016: Order for Second Stage","time":1485380400,"counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500065#QQQ00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485380400,"counter":554,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1485380400,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500065#QQQ00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485380400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016: Second Stage","time":1485380400,"counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500065#QQQ00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1485380400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to introduce this Bill to the House on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who regrets that she is unable to be present.  <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016 is a relatively short but significant piece of legislation.  I cannot but be struck that we are following on from the previous Bill, the National Shared Services Office Bill, which contains many references to data protection and so on.  There is, therefore, a seamless move between the two Bills in some ways.  The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to provisions of Directive 2013\/40\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against information systems.  The Bill will also give effect to many of the key provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the Budapest convention, which Ireland signed in 2002.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation before us reflects the EU directive in that it provides for criminal offences in relation to attacks against information systems and establishes effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for such offences, the most serious of which could result in a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.  The offences provided for relate to information systems and data and do not cover content-related matters.  The Bill creates new offences relating to unauthorised accessing of information systems; unauthorised interference with information systems or with data on such systems; unauthorised interception of transmissions of data to or from information systems; and the use of tools, such as computer programmes, passwords or devices, to facilitate the commission of these offences relating to information systems.<\/p>  <p>  Before outlining the content of the Bill in more detail, I will provide some context for the legislation.  It is true to say that information systems are very much part of our daily lives in the modern world.  They are increasingly relied upon by governments, businesses and individuals alike.  The term \"information system\" itself, as defined in the Bill, is deliberately broad, encompassing all devices involved in the processing and storage of data, and not only those considered to be \"computer systems\" in the traditional sense.  This reflects the range of modern communications and data storage technology currently available, such as tablets and smartphones.  Information systems also encompass the IT infrastructure or networks that support communication systems and individual devices as well as data.  The term \"data\" is also broadly circumscribed in the Bill as meaning any representation of facts, information or concepts in a form capable of being processed and includes a programme capable of causing an information system to perform a function.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubting the very significant benefits which modern information systems bring to our lives.  However, reliability on such systems can also unfortunately mean vulnerability.  New technology creates opportunities for new crimes.  Cybercrime and attacks on information systems have become increasingly problematic and challenging across Europe and the world in general.  The European Commission brought forward its proposal for a directive in this area against a backdrop of steadily increasing cybercrime.  This included previously unknown large-scale and dangerous attacks against the information systems of entities, such as banks, the public sector and even the military, in EU member states and other countries.  New concerns emerged in this area, such as the massive spread of malicious software.  Such \"malware\", as it is termed, can, for instance, create what are known as \"botnets\", which are networks of infected computers that can be remotely controlled to stage large-scale co-ordinated attacks.  These networks of compromised computers may be activated, often without the knowledge of the users of these computers, to perform specific actions such as attacks against information systems.<\/p>  <p>  The interconnection of computers and information systems through cyberspace facilitates communication between companies and individuals across the world.  What has become clear is that as cyberspace has developed and evolved, as has cybercrime, which is a transnational phenomenon.  Traditional law is based on physical geography whereas cybercrimes occur in the \"virtual\" world of cyberspace and readily intersect and transcend national boundaries.  There is a clear need, therefore, for international co-operation in this area and for harmonisation of national laws to counter the very real threats faced.  It is vital that we seek to protect citizens, businesses and government structures alike from cyberattacks which represent such a growing challenge in the modern technological environment.  This is the central aim of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I now propose to outline in more detail the content of the Bill, which contains 17 sections and largely reflects the EU directive on attacks against information systems, as I mentioned.  Section 1 provides the necessary interpretation provisions for the Bill and includes a definition of \"information system\".  The term \"information system\", rather than \"computer\", is used in order to enable the Bill to have the widest possible application, taking account of rapidly evolving technology in this area.  This section also includes a broad definition of \"data\".  Both these definitions are based on the definitions contained in the directive.  Further important definitions in section 1 relate to the concepts of \"lawful authority\" and \"right holder\".  These are particularly significant in relation to how the offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Bill are framed.  I will outline these offences presently, having made a couple of preliminary comments in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The activities concerned such as access to or interference with information systems or data are not offences if they are performed with lawful authority such as with the permission of the owner or right holder of the system.  It is clearly not intended to criminalise the activities of those who have authority to access information systems or possess a computer programme or code for the purpose of maintaining, testing or protecting information systems.  There are, for example, companies which carry out such activities legitimately in the course of their work, which could involve testing the security of information systems and protecting them from attack.  Such companies are effectively exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  A further point of commonality in the manner in which the offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, are framed is the notion of intent.  When the activities described are carried out with lawful authority and without criminal intent, they cannot be considered to be offences.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 provides that it is an offence to intentionally access an information system by infringing a security measure without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  Section 3 provides that it is an offence to intentionally interfere with an information system so as to hinder or interrupt its functioning.  It also describes the various means of interference such as, for example, inputting data to the system, damaging or deleting data or making data on the system inaccessible.<\/p><p> Section 4 provides that it is an offence to intentionally interfere with data on an information system, for example, by deleting, altering or causing the deterioration of the data.  Section 5 provides that it is an offence to intentionally intercept the non-public transmission of data to or from or within an information system.  Section 6 provides that it is an offence to intentionally produce, sell, import, distribute or otherwise make available a computer programme or any device, computer password, access code or similar data for the purpose of the commission of an offence under section 2, 3, 4 or 5.  It will be noted that the direct intention to commit an offence is specifically required in relation to this provision, in addition to the general intent requirement contained in all of the offence provisions.  This reflects the requirements of the EU directive and has been designed to avoid criminalisation where such tools or devices are produced and put on the market for legitimate purposes such as testing the security of information systems.<\/p> <p> Section 7 allows a search warrant to be issued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the District Court for the investigation of the suspected commission of offences under the Bill.  It also sets out the process involved and provides for related matters.  It includes a requirement that a person under investigation shall, on request, provide the Garda with any password or key code necessary to operate a computer or access the data.  This provision essentially replaces the search warrant provision in section 13 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 insofar as it relates to data and applies the provision generally to the investigation of offences relating to information systems.  Section 13 of the Bill amends the 1991 Act and includes a transitional provision in respect of search warrants issued under the Act.  I will return to section 13 and the Criminal Damage Act shortly.<\/p> <p> Section 8 sets out the penalties for the commission of offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive.  It provides that a person who commits an offence under section 2, 4, 5 or 6 will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both.  On conviction on indictment, the offences are punishable by a fine or a term of up to five years in prison, or both.  The same penalties apply on summary conviction for offences committed under section 3 which relates to unlawful interference with an information system but conviction on indictment for this offence carries an even more prohibitive penal sanction of up to ten years.  This penalty reflects the gravity of the offence and the potential for damage in which unlawful interference with an information system could result.  <\/p> <p> Section 8 further provides that fraudulent use of the personal data of another person will be treated as an aggravating factor when the court is determining sentence for an offence under section 3 or 4.  It also provides for penalties for offences in relation to the search warrant provisions in section 7.  Such offences include obstructing a Garda member acting under authority of a search warrant, failure to provide information to facilitate Garda access to a computer or failure to give the Garda a correct name and address.<\/p> <p> Section 9 clarifies that where an offence under the Bill is committed by a body corporate, liability will rest with the person acting on behalf of the body corporate, as well as with the body corporate.  It may be necessary for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to bring forward a minor but essentially technical amendment to the section on Committee Stage.  Legal advice is awaited from the Office of the Attorney General in this regard.  <\/p> <p> Section 10 establishes legal jurisdiction with regard to the commission of offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive.  It provides that a person may be tried in the State for an offence under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, whether the offence is committed in relation to an information system in the State by a person who is inside or outside the State.  Legal jurisdiction also extends to the commission of such an offence in relation to an information system outside the State if the person is an Irish citizen, ordinarily resident in the State or a body corporate or company under the law of the State and the act is an offence under the law of the place where it is committed.  <\/p> <p> Section 11 relates to evidence of Irish citizenship in the context of legal proceedings for offences under the Bill committed outside the State.  It clarifies that it is an officer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who certifies that a passport has issued and that it is an officer of the Minister for Justice and Equality who certifies that a person has not ceased to be an Irish citizen.  <\/p> <p> Section 12 deals with the legal concept of \"double jeopardy\" and provides that a person who has been tried for an offence outside the State will not be proceeded against for an offence under this legislation in respect of which the person has already been tried.<\/p> <p> Section 13 amends the Criminal Damage Act 1991 insofar as it relates to damage to computer data in the context of damage to property.  The offences contained in the 1991 Act in relation to computer data are being deleted and will instead be covered and expanded on in this legislation.  Section 5 of the 1991 Act which relates to unauthorised access to computer data is, for instance, being deleted and replaced by section 2 of the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 14 amends the Bail Act 1997 to include in the Schedule to that Act the offences provided for under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Bill.  The Schedule to the 1997 Act specifies serious offences, in respect of which an application for bail may be refused by the court.  The offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Bill will, therefore, come within this category.  <\/p> <p> Section 15 is a technical amendment to Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice Act 2011 which provides for certain powers and procedures in relation to the prosecution and investigation of white collar crime.  Schedule 1 specifies the offences which are relevant for the purposes of the 2011 Act and includes the data-related offences which are contained in the Criminal Damage Act 1991 and will be replaced by thd Bill.  Section 15, therefore, includes the new offences in the Schedule and also inserts a transitional provision to cover data-related offences which were committed under the Criminal Damage Act prior to commencement of this legislation.  <\/p> <p> I mention at this point that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality proposes to make a minor technical amendment to section 15 on Committee Stage.  It relates to the renumbering of the new paragraph 31 which the Bill inserts into the Criminal Justice Act 2011 to 30A as a paragraph 31 has already been inserted into the 2011 Act by other amending legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 16 provides that expenses incurred by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the administration of this legislation shall, to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  <\/p> <p> Section 17 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill.<\/p> <p> There will, of course, be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail any aspect of the Bill Deputies wish to explore further.  I am sure they will agree that it is vital that we seek to safeguard modern information and communications systems and also maintain users' confidence in the safety and reliability of such systems.  This is arguably even more important and appropriate in Ireland which has become somewhat of a global cyber hub in view of the number of high tech information technology and Internet-based companies that have major operations here.  The legislation ensures unlawful activities relating to information systems will be criminalised and that strong penalties will be in place to both deter and punish offenders.  I am pleased, therefore, to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500065#QQQ01000","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485381000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle makes awards to Deputies for hard work and working long hours, but if he does, I would like to nominate Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and myself as we started our public duties in Leinster House at 9 a.m. at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and are still going some 13 hours later.

In the directive which the Bill seeks to transpose it is mentioned that several offences should be criminalised, at least in cases that are not minor.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State might also turn his mind to whether in section 2 a definition is needed of \"a security measure\".  If we are to criminalise certain behaviour, we need to ensure people are aware that what they are doing is criminal.  Section 2 states: \"A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, intentionally accesses an information system by infringing a security measure shall be guilty of an offence\".  It is important for people to be aware of what is a security measure.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 3 deals with \"Interference with information system without lawful authority\", while section 4 deals with \"Interference with data without lawful authority\".  Section 5 deals with \"Intercepting transmission of data without lawful authority\", while section 6 deals with \"Use of computer programme, password, code or data for purposes of\" committing the offences outlined.  <\/p>  <p>  Last evening when we dealt with the Criminal Justice (Suspended Sentences of Imprisonment) Bill 2016, I referred to how on many occasions we drafted and debated criminal justice legislation, identified offences and set out what the penalties were.  This legislation is consistent with that approach because when we reach section 8, we see what the penalties are.  They appear to be universal in that they are a fine or a term of imprisonment.  As we said at the committee meeting this morning, we need to become more sophisticated in our choice of penalties in legislation.  It is far too easy for legislators, when considering penalties for offences, to insert the usual penalty of imprisonment and\/or a fine.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We need to think of other potential penalties that can be imposed.  If we continue to keep criminalising different types of behaviour, as we are doing here by criminalising certain behaviour in respect of information data systems, we should be broadening our approach to the nature of penalties that can be imposed.<\/p> <p> I do not propose to take any more of our time, other than to say that we will be supporting the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.  I ask the Minister to consider whether it is necessary for a definition to be given to a security measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500066#RRR00400","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485381600,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for being so concise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500067#SSS00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485381600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I will be even shorter than Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  <\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will also be supporting the Bill which, as outlined, gives effect to the provisions of Directive 2013\/40\/EU.  The Bill seeks to amend some existing legislation.  The law on cybercrime in Ireland is somewhat outdated, fragmented across a number of pieces of legislation and unwieldy.  The provisions in some of those Acts date back as far as the early 1990s.  They are no longer fit for purpose.  Given the technological advances in the past 20 odd years there is a need to consolidate and modernise laws pertaining to the protection of information and communication systems.  For that reason, we will be giving the Bill our full support.  We are considering the possibility of tabling one amendment to section 7 concerning search warrants.  We wish to tease that out on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the comments of the previous speaker on section 8.  I do not know whether it is feasible for us to move amendments to examine alternatives to the offences that are being proposed under the legislation.  Following last night's observation by Deputy O'Callaghan, it is something that we will be paying a lot more detailed attention to in future when Bills come before us.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister has outlined the Bill's provisions in its 17 sections, I will not repeat them.  There will be a debate on Committee Stage.  We fully support the Bill, although there is the possibility that we will table one amendment.  I will not delay these proceedings any longer than necessary just for the sake of running down the clock.  We support the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500067#SSS00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1485381600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I thank the House for giving time to this Bill.  As I said earlier, this is significant legislation.  I thank Deputies for their contributions and general support for the Bill.  It is clear that there is a shared determination to combat cybercrime by bringing our laws up to date.  The Bill focuses on protecting information systems, and the data they contain, from unauthorised access or interference.  This is vital to the interests of businesses, Government structures and individual citizens alike, given the central role information systems play in all of our lives now.  As technology advances and new forms of crime evolve, our legislative frameworks must also develop to counter these threats.  Deputy O'Brien is right to say we must bring our laws up to date.<\/p>  <p>  There was a time when crime was usually committed in a physical space, a place where the criminal was also present such as in the traditional forms of fraud or theft.  Technology-related offences are committed in cyberspace, where the perpetrator may be at a very distant physical remove from their crime target, operating stealthily and insidiously.  While cyber criminals could be considered to operate in a somewhat virtual digital world, remotely and virtually invisibly, the effects of their attacks are very real indeed.  In fact, it has been estimated that the cost of cybercrime to the Irish economy is some &euro;630 million a year.  Grant Thornton, the consultants who carried out this analysis, discovered that the cost of traditional crimes such as welfare and tax fraud, moving into the online environment, is a significant threat to the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation we are introducing seeks to protect information systems, and their important data, from cyber attacks from both within and outside the State.  The Bill makes it an offence to engage in cybercrime activity and provides strong penalties for those found guilty of offences relating to information systems, including up to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment if the crime is sufficiently serious.<\/p>  <p>  Cybercrime activities come in many forms.  Broadly, they involve criminal attacks on information systems and infrastructures themselves, or on their associated data.  Data are an increasingly valuable commodity in the economic world.  Information - personal information in particular - carries a premium.  Criminal gangs are aware of this and perpetrate large-scale, pervasive attacks involving unauthorised access, collection and use of data for monetary gain.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the more common forms of cybercrime involve identity theft, online Internet scams or fraud, cyber theft from business, cyber extortion, industrial espionage and online intellectual property theft.  It is these crimes that are causing the greatest impact economically, both in Ireland and across the globe.<\/p>  <p>  Cybercrime is an international, worldwide problem.  It knows or respects no borders.  There is a need, therefore, for international co-operation to counter this menace.  Harmonisation of national laws is one important way of doing this.  By strengthening our laws across Europe and beyond, we present a united front against cybercrime and counter its transnational dimension.  The legislation before us will serve to transpose the EU directive on attacks against information systems and ensure that Ireland can stand alongside our European partners in combating criminality in this area and protecting vital  infrastructures.<\/p>  <p>  International co-operation is also necessary on a practical, operational level through the sharing of information between police authorities in order to bring cyber criminals to justice and enforce our laws.  A key aim of the EU directive, in addition to criminalising offences relating to information systems, is to improve co-operation with and between competent authorities, including the police and other law enforcement services such as Europol and its European Cyber Crime Centre.<\/p>  <p>  For the purpose of exchanging information on cyber offences, member states are required to have an operational national point of contact which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The designated national contact point for Ireland is the Garda Computer Crime Investigation Unit, whose contact details have already been provided to the European Commission and can be made available to other member states and competent specialised agencies and bodies.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill ensures there are no gaps in our laws that can be exploited by those who would seek to perpetrate cyber crimes through unauthorised access to, or interference with, information systems or the important data retained on them.  This is clearly important for businesses, the Government sector and individual citizens alike.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's initial comment about the time of night reminds me of a Deputy years ago who came in here looking for overtime sheets.  I thank Opposition Deputies for their co-operation on this measure and look forward to Committee Stage.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500067#SSS00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485381600,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1485381600,"counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500067#SSS00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1485381600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500067#SSS00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485381600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485381600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.10 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 26 January 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
