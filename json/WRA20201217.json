Each local authority is responsible for the monitoring of these standards with regard to the registration of such establishments.<\/p><p>Following a review, my Department is currently developing necessary legislative amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, which will further enhance the local authority inspection regime,  with a view to inclusion in the 2021 Government legislative programme.<\/p><p>The enforcement of animal welfare standards for all animals, including dogs in dog breeding establishments, is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts.  DAFM introduced Regulations regarding the microchipping of dogs, S.I. No. 63 of 2015,  which means that all dogs must be microchipped.  Furthermore, in late 2019, DAFM also introduced the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019 in respect of the advertising of pet animals, including dogs.

Furthermore, the recently published PPN Handbook, developed in consultation with all stakeholders, provides extensive guidance on operational matters.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a root-and-branch review of the PPN structures is set to take place next year. Its purpose is to assess the operation of the network to date against the overall objectives and to make recommendations on how to build on existing strengths and support the future development of PPNs. A key element of this review will be consultation with all stakeholders. The review is expected to begin in early 2021 and conclude by the end of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700083#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Funding","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700083#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[43580\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700083#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"her views on adding a requirement that all funding from her Department includes provisions to meet and further rights of persons with disabilities.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>Actions to meet and further the rights of persons with disabilities are delivered across a number of Government Departments and organisations, with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth having responsibility for the National Disability Inclusion Strategy which runs from 2017 to 2021. My Department has many funding programmes which groups can apply for, including those that work to meet and further rights of persons with disabilities. They include:<\/p>  <p>  - Under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), funding is provided to Local Development Companies to complete work with marginalised individuals, including persons with disabilities and the groups that represent them. <\/p>  <p>  - Between January 2018 and June 2020, over 300 community groups targeting people with a disability, and over 5,100 individuals who registered as having a disability, have been assisted through SICAP.<\/p>  <p>  - This type of support will continue over the lifetime of the programme, which runs from 2018 to 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multiannual core funding to national organisations that demonstrate good governance and deliver services and supports that have a focus on one or more of the following: addressing poverty, social exclusion, and promoting equality. The current scheme commenced in July 2019 and is due to close in 2022. &euro;18.8 million was allocated to 74 organisations for the 36-month period of the scheme.

They are the Disability Federation of Ireland, Disability Equality Specialist Support Agency Company Limited by Guarantee and Inclusion Ireland - National Association for People with an Intellectual Disability.<\/p>  <p>  - Several other organisations funded under the scheme provide supports and programmes addressing a wide range of social inclusion issues, including disability supports. <\/p>  <p>  - In 2020, my Department has approved &euro;691,231 for the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in public libraries. This has supported the creation of sensory rooms, gardens and the provision of sensory equipment including comfort kits, Magic Tables and Hublets. These facilities will be used by individuals with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, sensory impairments, special educational needs and other learning difficulties, and those on the Autism spectrum. <\/p>  <p>  - In addition, since 2019 I have paid &euro;1.3 million under the Dormant Accounts Fund for library supports to disadvantaged, socially excluded and marginalised communities, these projects included initiatives for those with profound physical and learning needs and also visual and hearing impairments. My Department&rsquo;s Libraries Capital Programme also requires projects to comply with building regulations which legislate for the needs of people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  - The Community Enhancement Programme provides small capital grants to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. Examples of such projects addressing the needs of persons with disabilities include the provision of wheel chair access ramps\/lifts, retro-fitting premises to allow disabled access, and equipment\/technology to assist those with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  - The Community Services Programme, or CSP, currently supports over 420 community organisations to provide services to disadvantages communities and target groups through a social enterprise model, while also creating employment opportunities for specific disadvantaged groups, including persons with disabilities. The CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution to the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and a manager, where warranted.  <\/p>  <p>- My Department also funds a Public Participation Network in every Local Authority area, with special representation for local social inclusion groups, including those advocating for people with disabilities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700083#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Town and Village Renewal Scheme","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700083#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[43975\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700083#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"her plans to bring forward an enhanced town and village renewal scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>The regeneration and revitalisation of our rural towns and villages is a key priority for my Department.

There have been investments of scale in the technology, med tech and pharma sectors, from companies like Beckman Coulter, Edwards Lifesciences, Extreme Networks, Jaguar Land Rover and in recent months Exida and MeiraGTx.<\/p>  <p>  The Mid-West region is supported by the IDA with the provision of Advance Building Solutions which assist employment in the surrounding areas. IDA actively engages with Clare County Council, Shannon Commercial Properties and other property owners and stakeholders on their development plans, and markets sites and property solutions across the Mid-West region including Ennis through its extensive overseas network to both existing and new investors.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s property budget for 2021 will continue to fund the IDA Regional Property Programme. This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding outside of Dublin, thereby helping to attract more overseas firms to the regions. The IDA&rsquo;s 2021 allocation includes an additional &euro;10m over 2020 funding for the Regional Property Programme, bringing it up to &euro;52m.  <\/p>  <p>  The Clare region is well positioned to continue to attract new FDI investment and grow employment in existing companies and IDA Ireland will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders and parties in the region to achieve this objective under the Regional Enterprise Action Plan 2020. The Clare Technology Park, Gort Road, Ennis is not currently under consideration by IDA as a site for an Advanced Building Solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700084#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":225,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 97 to 100, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Relations","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[44123\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the engagements he has had with the workers of a company (details supplied) during their ongoing dispute over redundancy.","asker":"1488","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>I extend my sympathies to the workers in Debenhams who have lost their jobs.

In particular, my officials with PIAB, are considering how to increase the number of cases which are settled by PIAB without recourse to litigation.

The Report shows there is little benefit in rejecting a PIAB award when it takes nearly twice as long to settle a case through litigation and for a similar sized settlement. <\/p>  <p>  I have prioritised the reform of PIAB and have instructed my officials to examine potential measures to enhance PIAB&rsquo;s remit and role.  These measures relate to both administrative changes within the current PIAB system as well as potential legislative changes to increase the number of cases kept within the PIAB system. This work is ongoing. As set out in the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, we will report on progress early in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  PIAB reform and the full implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform will help to ensure that we have an insurance system which is both affordable and reliable and one which underpins a vibrant economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Communications Market Regulation","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[43816\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"when he expects to progress the programme for Government commitment to enable regulatory bodies such as ComReg, the Central Bank and the CCPC to have greater use of administrative penalties to sanction rogue operators, as is the norm in other EU Member States; when he expects the Competition Bill (ECN+) to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>Directive 2019\/1\/EU (the ECN+ Directive) will empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.

It is designed to benefit EU and Canadian companies through improved trade flows in support of increased employment for our citizens.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.  <\/p>  <p>  The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces, giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free-access for most of our important food exports.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic &ndash; a particular benefit for SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  CETA has provisionally applied across the EU since the 21st September 2017, meaning those areas where the EU has full competence are already in force.  Since then, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed and the trade provisions which make the movement of Irish exports cheaper, faster, more predictable and efficient are in place.  We can see the benefits of CETA already, exports of Irish goods and services to Canada totalled almost &euro;4 billion in 2019, a 35% increase compared to 2016, the year prior to the provisional application of CETA.<\/p>  <p>  For consumers, CETA will provide more choice, promote competition and ensure that Canadian goods coming into the EU market, meet EU product health &amp;amp; safety standards. <\/p>  <p>  Business links between Ireland and Canada are deep and extensive.

The Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is administered by Enterprise Ireland, has been an effective instrument of policy particularly as a complement to my Department's Regional Enterprise Plans where it has served as an enabler for projects emerging from that regional collaborative process.<\/p><p>There have been three calls under the Fund to date and just over &euro;100 million in funding has been approved across 68 projects, with projects approved in every region.  <\/p><p>Ministers Troy, English and I will also be meeting with the Regional Steering Committees to consider the range of COVID-19 and wider economic challenges for their regions and issues arising in relation to vulnerable jobs and sectors and to develop options for additional measures that may be taken for their respective regions.<\/p><p>The process of refreshing the Regional Enterprise Plans for a further two-year cycle will begin in 2021 and the Department will continue to engage with relevant Departments during the new phase of the Regional Enterprise Plans.<\/p><p>On 20<sup>th<\/sup>of November last I announced &euro;8.24 million in grants for 95 Enterprise Centres around the country under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Centres Fund.

It will help the Centres implement a recovery plan for businesses within their remit over the next six to twelve months.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE06700"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[43897\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700085#WRE06800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to and is taking steps in relation to the difficulties facing workers in an airline (details supplied) who are continuing to face problems engaging with the human resources department of the airline regarding their payments and entitlements.","asker":"1585","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>I understand how difficult it must be for Aer Lingus employees facing renegotiations, restructuring and possibly lay-offs.

While the UK is, and will remain, a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority. In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape has been strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.

For that reason, as part of the Global Ireland 2025 Strategy, Enterprise Ireland opened a new office in Manchester in 2019. There has also been increased investment in our Embassy in London, by the Department of Foreign Affairs and from my Department and others, to ensure that our largest bilateral mission is fully equipped for these new challenges. <\/p>  <p>  The Consulate General in Cardiff, was also re-opened in April of 2019; and the Government also plans to open a new Consulate General of Ireland for the North of England, in Manchester, next year.

They range from supports for companies in the field of market diversification, liquidity supports through short-term and long-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures.

In December 2019, my Department published the Remote Work in Ireland report which outlined the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements in Ireland as well as the factors influencing its adoption.  This year, as a response to COVID-19, my Department launched a new webpage dedicated to providing guidance for remote working for both employers and employees. <\/p>  <p>  In July, my Department launched a Public Consultation on Remote Work. We received 522 submissions from employers, employees, representative bodies and special interest groups. Based on the insights garnered from the consultation, we updated our guidance webpage to include new information. The guidance webpage now includes a checklist for employers considering adopting remote working arrangements in the longer term. The guidance webpage will continue to be updated regularly to act as a live resource for employers and employees.<\/p>  <p>  Building on this work, my Department is currently developing a national Remote Work Strategy. An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) was formed to steer the delivery of the Strategy. This Group has broad representation across government departments and state agencies. The Strategy will consider what changes are needed to develop an environment that encourages remote working solutions. The Strategy will include a set of actions to be delivered and an Implementation Group will monitor the progress of these actions.  <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the Strategy will be published very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700086#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700086#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[43686\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700086#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the details of the engagement his Department has had with a representative association (details supplied) regarding the Covid restriction support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>The pandemic has caused untold damage to people's lives and livelihoods.

CETA is designed to benefit EU and Canadian companies through improved trade flows in support of increased employment for our citizens.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures that flow from CETA all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.<\/p>  <p>  Diversifying trade is an important part of our Brexit response and it will be an important factor in our recovery post-pandemic.  To this end, the best way to achieve export growth and market diversification is by improving market access and reducing costs of entering those markets which is what CETA delivers.  Business links between Ireland and Canada are deep and extensive.  Outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market.  Indeed more than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients are doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free-access for most of our important food exports.  In addition, we have a low beef import quota from Canada.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  The benefits and opportunities to business in the Agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  Indeed, CETA contains an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at ensuring they can take full advantage of the improved market access.<\/p>  <p>  In services and investment CETA is the most far-reaching agreement the EU has ever concluded.  Almost half of the benefits anticipated from CETA are expected in the services sector.  CETA makes it easier for EU individuals and companies to provide services to Canadian customers and vice versa.  It covers services such as legal, accountancy, transport and telecoms.  There is a huge opportunity for Ireland given its strengths in services where Ireland has been particularly successful in expanding its share of the world&rsquo;s services market in recent years with services exports accounting for approximately 60% of all exports in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  CETA will directly benefit Irish consumers.  It will scrap or cut almost all the customs duties which EU importers have to pay on goods coming from Canada.  As well as final products, the cost of parts, components and other inputs goods used to make final products also falls.  This is the case already under provisional application of the Agreement.  So, consumers can potentially enjoy lower prices and a wider choice of products and services, but only if the Canadian import satisfies all EU product rules including social and environmental standards, as well as people's health and safety and consumer rights.<\/p>  <p>  CETA has provisionally applied across the EU since the 21st September 2017 meaning those areas where the EU has full competence are already in force.  Since then, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed and the increased trade facilitation provisions which make the movement of Irish exports cheaper, faster, more predictable and efficient are in place.  We can see the benefits of CETA already, exports of Irish goods and services to Canada totalled approximately &euro;3.9 billion in 2019 a 35% increase compared to 2016, the last full year of trade, prior to the provisional application of CETA.  <\/p>  <p>  The combination of export-led growth and foreign direct investment has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s economy over recent decades.  As a small, open, economy, Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe and therefore we fully support balanced international trade and the collection of EU Free Trade Agreements that seek to underpin this.  This Agreement and the EU's other Trade Agreements are key instruments to assist the work of Enterprise Ireland in supporting Irish Enterprise in global markets.  Government approval has been received for the moving of a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the terms of CETA and it is my intention to bring forward this Motion as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700086#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700086#WRF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[43800\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700086#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of businesses in counties Laois and Offaly that have availed of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1591","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CCGS) is the largest guarantee scheme in the history of the State.

The study undertaken by Copenhagen Economics examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade, quantifying the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge due to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The study examined the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy and identified five sectors that account for 90% of the Brexit impact. These are: Agri-Food, Pharma-Chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. <\/p>  <p>  Of these five sectors, the Agri-Food sector was shown to be the most impacted in both a trade deal or no-deal scenario. In a no-deal, WTO scenario, over half of the economic impact relates to the Agri-Food and Pharma-Chemicals sectors. <\/p>  <p>  This trade analysis was undertaken on the basis of no policy change by Government in terms of mitigation actions to cushion the impacts of Brexit. Of course in the last four budgets, Government has put in place significant measures to cushion the impact of Brexit across all sectors of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  Over the last four budgets, through the enterprise agencies, I have put in place an extensive suite of enterprise supports to assist businesses to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. They range from liquidity supports through short-term and long-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies.   <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures.

Two-thirds of these investments are in the International Financial Services sector with the remaining third spread out over the Life Sciences, Technology, Business Services, and Engineering sectors.

With just two weeks until the UK leaves the Single Market and the Customs Union, work to ensure Government, business and citizens are getting Brexit ready is of paramount importance.<\/p>  <p>  Since the outcome of the UK referendum on Brexit in 2016, Government has had in place a rolling work programme across all Departments to bring about the necessary changes for Brexit. The central objective has been to provide, as far as possible, for the continuity of the free flow of trade with the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) because change will happen from 1 January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As regards my own Department and agencies, over the course of the last four budgets we have taken extensive action to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit and delivered, through the enterprise agencies, a wide range of initiatives aimed at getting businesses ready for Brexit. These range from planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets, and innovation supports. These are all provided through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland.<\/p>  <p>  Customs is an area that will most immediately impact businesses on 1 January next and we have been actively working to put in place grants and customs training programmes.   As part of the July Jobs Stimulus, Government rolled out a &euro;20 million Ready for Customs package to help businesses involved in exporting and importing with the UK to put in place the necessary internal arrangements, staffing, software, and IT systems to be ready for the new customs arrangements and regulatory requirements that will apply from 1 January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this package, Enterprise Ireland launched a new &ldquo;Ready for Customs&rdquo; grant through which businesses can claim grants of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired, or redeployed within the business, to a dedicated customs role. A second phase of Skillnet Ireland&rsquo;s free customs training, Clear Customs Online 2020, is open for applications, to support the customs intermediary sector and businesses that trade frequently with, or through, the UK. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also run an on-line Customs Insights course which is helping businesses to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to move goods from, to and through the UK. The Local Enterprise Offices are also carrying out the second phase of their &ldquo;Prepare Your Business for Customs&rdquo; workshops throughout the country.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to customs supports, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices offer a range of other initiatives to help businesses to develop.  Some of the Enterprise Ireland supports include the Be Prepared Grant, the Act On Initiative, the Market Discovery Fund and the Brexit Readiness Checker, while the Local Enterprise Offices offer the Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters (TAME) grant.<\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland is helping businesses who deal with cross-border trade prepare for Brexit.  The Brexit Planning Voucher worth &euro;2,250\/&pound;2,000 allows a business to contract professional advice to assist with Brexit and can for instance be used for customs training. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit financial supports have been developed and are available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland such as the Brexit Loan Scheme which offers businesses the means to deal with short term liquidity issues that could arise for instance in buying stock.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses also need longer term funding for investment purposes, and the SBCI Future Growth Loan Scheme, which was expanded at the beginning of the Summer in response to very high demand, provides up to &euro;800m in lending to eligible businesses to support strategic long-term investment, including for a post-Brexit\/post-Covid-19 environment.<\/p>  <p>  The new &euro;2 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme, which was launched in mid-September, is the largest guarantee scheme that has ever been provided for Irish businesses to date to ensure there is financing available for Irish businesses as they reboot and rebuild both through Covid-19 and Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Regulatory agencies under my remit have ongoing engagement in important regulatory areas such as product certification and standardisation, market surveillance and on consumer and competition issues.  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have hosted a number of webinars to inform businesses of the important steps they need to take to be Brexit ready from a regulatory perspective. These webinars, along with others by other Departments and agencies across Government, are available on www.gov.ie\/getbrexitready. <\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), have been informing online consumers what they need to do to prepare for the changes Brexit will bring.  This has been supported by a recent advertising campaign, outlining what consumers should consider when purchasing goods from UK websites.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department, through its agencies, continue to proactively engage with businesses, whether it has been hosting webinars, which are all available online, to one-to-one meetings informing them of the steps they need to take to be Brexit ready.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has been developed on a worst case scenario based of a No Deal Brexit. In the Budget, Government announced a recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion for a combination of COVID-19 and Brexit purposes with a specific contingency fund of &euro;100 million earmarked to assist businesses to deal with Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Preparing for the change that Brexit will bring from the start of next year is a key priority right across Government. This work has intensified and will continue in the period ahead.

The 2nd Motor Report of the National Claims Information Database, published in November, by the Central Bank clearly shows why this is necessary. It shows there is little benefit in rejecting a PIAB award, that it takes nearly twice as long to settle a case through litigation and for a similar sized settlement. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague Minster Troy, Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, has prioritised the reform of PIAB and has instructed his officials to examine a number of potential measures to enhance PIAB&rsquo;s remit and role within the overall scope of insurance reform in Ireland.  These measures relate to both administrative changes within the current process as well as potential legislative changes to increase the number of cases kept within the PIAB system.<\/p>  <p>  The cost and availability of insurance is a hugely significant issue for consumers and businesses in our country.

Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees.<\/p>  <p>   The Scheme was originally scheduled to run until 31 December 2020 in line with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework on State Aid.

It sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy and to attracting foreign investment in the ICT sector. The Statement followed an agreement of the Government, in October 2017, to create a strategic policy framework to support the continued development of data centres in Ireland, while conscious of the constraints of our electricity system and our national ambition to move to very high levels of renewable electricity generation. <\/p>  <p>  Work has been undertaken by IDA Ireland to identify suitable sites in the regions for developing data centres, having regard to the suitability of grid capacity. The Government is seeking to ensure that the costs of growing energy demand are minimised. We do this by encouraging data centre investments in regions where we have infrastructure capacity to facilitate investments of this scale and also where they contribute to regional development. However, it is important to note that IDA Ireland cannot determine the eventual locations chosen by data centres.<\/p>  <p>  Other Departments and agencies have also implemented aspects of the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy&rsquo;.

I expect that SEAI will publish this research in the coming weeks. We have seen recently a number of Corporate Power Purchase Agreements, purchased by data centre operators, in the Irish market and I hope we will see more.

In Ireland, it is intended to transpose the ECN+ Directive by primary legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The ECN+ Directive contains a framework of rules to ensure that National Competition Authorities (NCAs) have the necessary guarantees of independence, sufficient resources and appropriate powers of enforcement. This includes the ability to issue fines, for breaches of Articles 101 (prohibition of cartel behaviour) and 102 (prohibition of abuse of dominance behaviour) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Irish Courts are National Competition Authorities (NCAs) in Ireland for the purposes of EU competition law.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions in this Bill in relation to giving the CCPC and ComReg the power to impose administrative sanctions are solely those powers required for transposition of the ECN+ Directive.  The ECN+ Directive is partially intended to align the powers of the national competition authorities across the EU Member States in relation to the enforcement of competition law within the Union.  As such, once the Directive is transposed, Ireland will have the same powers as other Member States.

This Group met most recently on Monday, 14th December last.  The Department has also worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General, on preparing the General Scheme for this Bill. <\/p>  <p>  I intend to take a Memo to Government very shortly seeking approval for the drafting of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2021 as a priority.

In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape has been strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services. Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2019 of &euro;25.6bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2019, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 15% to &euro;5.65bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports. Exports to North America increased from &euro;4.08bn in 2018 to &euro;4.72bn, an increase of 16%. Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets. <\/p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions have supported the Government's major drive towards market diversification. The majority of trade missions in recent years have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These trade missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences. <\/p>  <p>  While it has not been possible to lead Trade Missions in 2020 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, promotion of our companies abroad continued through the work of our State agencies, and, in particular, their offices located on the ground internationally. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently in contact with Enterprise Ireland with a view to developing a Ministerial led Trade Mission Programme for 2021. At this stage, it is envisaged that such a programme will contain a mix of virtual and actual trade missions. At the same time, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies to sustain their existing export sales and to increasingly diversify their export markets. This will include strengthening sales and marketing capability of companies, with a particular focus on remote\/virtual channels and providing targeted financial and advisory supports to companies adversely impacted upon by COVID-19 and Brexit to support their adaptation to the challenging market environment.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700087#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700087#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[37038\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700087#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of the implementation of the Duffy-Cahill report and on efforts to resolve a dispute at a company (details supplied).","asker":"1481","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>Responsibility for employment rights, redundancy and insolvency recently transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Protection, and the recommendations made in the Duffy-Cahill report are currently being revisited. <\/p>  <p>  I have also asked the Company Law Review Group, as per the Programme for Government, to look again at aspects of Company Law in this area. <\/p>  <p>  I extend my sympathies to the workers in Debenhams who have lost their jobs.

With just two weeks until the UK leaves the Single Market and the Customs Union, work to ensure Government, business and citizens are getting Brexit ready is of paramount importance, because change will happen from 1 January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Since the outcome of the UK referendum on Brexit in 2016, Government has had in place a rolling work programme across all Departments to bring about the necessary changes for Brexit. The central objective has been to provide, as far as possible, for the continuity of the free flow of trade with the UK (excluding Northern Ireland). <\/p>  <p>  An important aspect of the Government response has been infrastructural work necessitated at our ports and airports and in particular, at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport. This is essential in maintaining the flow of trade in and out of the country to the greatest extent possible, including essential imported goods.   <\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, work has been undertaken across Government to invest in the infrastructure, systems, and staffing required for the additional customs checks and other regulatory controls required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport to allow for continuity of trade with Great Britain. <\/p>  <p>  As well as building the necessary infrastructure, Budget 2021 also provides for additional resourcing for Departments, Offices and Agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine and the HSE, to support and carry out customs, SPS and food safety checks and controls.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has also been working with shipping companies, hauliers and port operators in terms of the provision of alternative direct shipping routes to Europe instead of using the UK Landbridge given likely delays using that route to get to and from European markets.  Direct routes will avoid the uncertainty of delays and disruption from 1 January 2021 and the need for customs notifications, documentation and financial guarantees.  A number of the ferry operators have announced the provision of additional capacity on direct routes to Europe from January next and recently, a new operator to the Irish market announced a regular ferry services from Rosslare to Dunkirk.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Government has made available to businesses a range of advisory services, financial incentives such as Brexit planning vouchers, as well as financial grant aid to help businesses get ready for Brexit.

With just two weeks until the UK leaves the Single Market and the Customs Union, work to ensure Government, business and citizens are Brexit ready is of paramount importance, because change will happen from 1 January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Key elements of Brexit readiness right across all Government Departments and agencies has been progressing since the outcome of the UK referendum on Brexit in 2016. Since that time, Government has published three Brexit preparedness Action Plans, the most recent being September 2020. Since September, Brexit readiness work has being intensified across all Departments and agencies to be Brexit ready for the end of the transition period, whatever the outcome of the EU\/UK negotiations. Our readiness work is supported by a major national communications campaign under the &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; brand.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of budgets, Government has taken extensive action to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit, and in the case of businesses, has providing numerous initiatives to assist businesses get Brexit ready. These range from planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets, and innovation supports. These are all provided through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland.  These initiatives are monitored and adapted as necessary to ensure they effectively address the challenges of Brexit. In successive budgets, new and additional initiatives have been introduced and we will continue to support businesses and the economy as needed with the introduction of additional measures.  <\/p>  <p>  Customs is an area that will most immediately impact businesses on 1 January next and we have been adapting our response by putting grants and customs training programmes in place.   Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ready for Customs&rdquo; grant provides up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired, or redeployed within the business, to a dedicated customs role. A second phase of Skillnet Ireland&rsquo;s free customs training, Clear Customs Online 2020, is open for applications, to support the customs intermediary sector and businesses that trade frequently with, or through, the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also put in place extensive financial and other supports for sectors to assist businesses prepare for and mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit.  These include the Brexit Loan Scheme, the expanded Future Growth Loan Scheme and the &euro;2 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme to help businesses with their finances as they reboot and rebuild both through Covid-19 and Brexit.  Additional funding was provided to Microfinance Ireland to help microenterprises that can not avail of bank funding over the coming period. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, Government has provided for a recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion for a combination of COVID-19 and Brexit and specifically earmarked a contingency fund of &euro;100 million to assist businesses with Brexit. We will keep under review the existing measures in place for Brexit and, should additional supports prove necessary, we will use the recovery fund to protect the economy in the same manner as we have done for COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  We have also been engaged with the European Commission in the context of the &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve the proposal for which is expected to be published by the Commission shortly. This fund is aimed at protecting those Member States most impacted by Brexit and, as the Member State that stands to lose most from Brexit, Ireland is actively pursuing our share of this fund.  <\/p>  <p>  Separately and in parallel to the task of preparing businesses for Brexit, my Department has also, through Enterprise Ireland, been actively working on a strategy of market diversification for companies to find other markets.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's overall export performance over the last 10 years has been marked by year-on-year growth with total exports of goods and services reaching further record levels of &euro;374 billion in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The overall scale of the Ireland-UK trade relationship can be seen through the &euro;51 billion of goods and services we exported in 2019, while importing &euro;41 billion from the UK. While the UK is, and will remain, a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority. In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape has been strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services. Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of worldwide exports in 2019 of &euro;25.6bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2019, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 15% to &euro;5.65bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports. Exports to North America increased from &euro;4.08bn in 2018 to &euro;4.72bn, an increase of 16%.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies exports to the UK amounted to &euro;7.9 billion in 2019, which represent an increase of 2% on the 2018 figure. While the UK continues to be the top export market for Enterprise Ireland client companies, such exports now account for 31% of total exports, having fallen from 36% in 2015 in accordance with the market diversification strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that through this work with Enterprise Ireland, firms will be encouraged to look to other markets and to expand their footprint outside of the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700088#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700088#WRH02700"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[43666\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700088#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the status of all proposed EU trade agreements and Ireland&rsquo;s position on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular format as follows:  <\/p><p>In addition to the above the since the beginning of 2019 EU Trade Agreements have entered into force with Japan, Singapore and Vietnam.

The Plan sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Four actions in the Plan relate to enhancing and reforming the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). The PIAB model delivers major benefits by providing a low-cost, quick and fair option in injury compensation.  However, PIAB have seen decreases in their number of claim settlements in recent years and an increased number of claims are settled by litigation resulting in higher legal costs and longer times to settle.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Troy has prioritised the reform of PIAB and, in line with the timeline for implementation of the second commitment in the Action Plan, has instructed his officials to work closely with PIAB to develop a roadmap for reform arising from these proposals by year end. A particular focus of this work is how to increase the number of cases which are settled by PIAB without recourse to litigation. The 2nd Motor Report from the Central Bank, published in November, clearly shows why this is necessary. It shows there is little benefit in rejecting a PIAB award, that it takes nearly twice as long to settle a case through litigation and for a similar sized settlement. Working with PIAB, officials are examining a number of potential measures to enhance PIAB&rsquo;s remit and role within the overall scope of insurance reform in Ireland.  These measures relate to both administrative changes within the current process as well as potential legislative changes to increase the number of cases kept within the PIAB system.<\/p>  <p>  The other two commitments in the Plan relate to holding a public consultation on reform measures and delivering an enhanced role for PIAB. These are due for completion in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance is a hugely significant issue for consumers and businesses in our country. The full implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform will help to ensure that we have an insurance system which is both affordable and reliable and one which underpins a vibrant economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700088#WRH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700089#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[28813\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700089#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will report on his engagement with the trade union movement in relation to issues regarding collective redundancy legislation reform.","asker":"1522","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>Ministers of State Robert Troy and Damien English jointly met with employer and union representative bodies on the 4th of November to begin a discussion on the legislative provisions that deal with redundancy and insolvency from both a company law and employment law perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that it was a positive and constructive meeting with stakeholders with a view to identifying whether there are gaps or weaknesses in either body of legislation.

These sub-groups are focused on Entrepreneurship; Productivity, Digitalisation and Competitiveness; Internationalisation; and Clustering and Networks.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals developed include measures to help SMEs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets, as well as recommendations aimed at helping SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital, green economy. They also focus on creating and growing local business networks and clusters, which are an important driver of regional development. <\/p>  <p>  On Thursday 3 December I chaired the fourth and final meeting of the SME Growth Taskforce, at which the final draft of an SME Growth Plan was discussed. The Taskforce reflected upon the need to recognise the significance and importance of Entrepreneurship in Ireland and I am pleased that measures to drive entrepreneurship feature strongly in the report.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce also reflected upon the need to recognise the significance and importance of entrepreneurship in Ireland, and in doing so, suggested the renaming of the SME Growth Plan to that of a National SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan.

I understand that while staff were informed last Friday, the majority of the jobs will remain until late 2022. <\/p><p>As always in these situations, our primary concern is for the workers and families affected.  Every State support will be made available to those workers to help them transition and find new employment opportunities, when that need arises. <\/p><p>Despite this disappointing decision, Viatris has made it clear that it remains fully committed to Ireland. Even after this announcement the company will employ 1,400 staff across the country, in Galway, Dublin and Cork. <\/p><p>IDA Ireland is in close contact with the company and will work closely with them to market the site to other potential investors. We have good reason to be confident that this process will be successful.<\/p><p>Obviously, in the current climate, there are many challenges facing us in the pursuit for FDI. Global competition for FDI is intensifying and we are under no illusions that the time ahead will prove more challenging. We will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects and the jobs that go with them. However, IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year demonstrated the resilience of our FDI base. The Agency has secured over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time. Full figures for the year will be available early next month. <\/p><p>I believe that these 2020 investments reflect our continuing attractiveness to overseas firms. Overseas companies continue, the evidence would suggest, to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible workforce, a track record as a successful home to global businesses and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700089#WRJ07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Liquidations","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700090#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[44457\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700090#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will work with the employees of a group (details supplied) and their trade union representatives to see a fair and suitable outcome when the company ceases trading.","asker":"1476","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[44570\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700090#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will engage with the workers of a group (details supplied) and their trade union to ensure that the company will honour the workers collective agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 224 together.<\/p><p>Joint provisional liquidators have been appointed by the High Court to four Irish operating companies, that are part of the UK fashion group Arcadia.  <\/p><p>I extend my sympathies to the workers who are in danger of losing their jobs.

This is a record allocation and will significantly bolster the capability of our enterprise and regulatory agencies to help businesses examine their Brexit exposure, seek advice, avail of customs training and make plans to protect their business.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's overall export performance over the last 10 years has been marked by year-on-year growth with total exports of goods and services reaching further record levels of &euro;374 billion in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  While the UK is and will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority. In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape has been strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services. Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2019 of &euro;25.6bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2019, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 15% to &euro;5.65bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports. Exports to North America increased from &euro;4.08bn in 2018 to &euro;4.72bn, an increase of 16%. Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets. <\/p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions have supported the Government's major drive towards market diversification. The majority of trade missions in recent years have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These Trade Missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences. <\/p>  <p>  While it has not been possible to lead Trade Missions in 2020 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, promotion of our companies abroad continued through the work of our State agencies, and, in particular, their offices located on the ground internationally. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently in contact with Enterprise Ireland with a view to developing a Ministerial led Trade Mission Programme for 2021. At this stage, it is envisaged that such a programme will contain a mix of virtual and actual trade missions. At the same time, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies to sustain their existing export sales and to increasingly diversify their export markets. This will include strengthening sales and marketing capability of companies, with a particular focus on remote\/virtual channels and providing targeted financial and advisory supports to companies adversely impacted upon by COVID-19 and Brexit to support their adaptation to the challenging market environment.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700090#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700090#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[44639\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700090#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which Ireland&rsquo;s international network of embassies can be utilised in the promotion of trade and Irish exports in the aftermath of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Global Ireland 2025 objective of Strengthening Team Ireland&rsquo;s presence abroad and accelerating diversification of export markets, my Department has appointed four senior officials to our Embassies since 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The Counsellor post in the Embassy in Washington is designed to reflect the increasing importance of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic trade and investment interests and US developments in these policy domains in the current rapidly evolving US policy context. The need to build on our growing relationship with China, to gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges for exports and investment and to promote cooperation, led the Department to making its first deployment at Attach&eacute; level in the Embassy in Beijing. This expansion in 2020 builds on the appointment in 2019 of senior officials to Berlin and London and of the work of the larger team from the Department based in Brussels on trade and competitiveness, and in Geneva, dealing with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation.<\/p>  <p>  Under Global Ireland 2025 Enterprise Ireland is charged with accelerating the diversification of export markets by its clients, with the ambition to: <\/p>  <p>  - double the total value of EI client exports outside the UK from the 2015 baseline by 2025; <\/p>  <p>  - double Eurozone exports by 2025; and <\/p>  <p>  - increase the diversification of client exports into new markets, with at least 70% of exports going beyond the UK by 2025. <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made in achieving these targets.

The eight offices are: Munich, Lyon, Manchester, Copenhagen, Montreal, Seattle, Melbourne and Ho Chi Minh City. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s objective under Global Ireland 2025 is to accelerate the diversification of FDI source markets, indicated by doubling the growth in IDA-supported project investments from non-US markets in the period 2018-2024. IDA Ireland has made significant progress in achieving this objective. The share of investments from outside North America increased from 30% to 37% over the period 2014 to 2019. At end 2019, there were over 1,600 IDA Ireland client companies employing 245,000 people in Ireland, with 60% of these jobs outside Dublin city. <\/p>  <p>  The agency actively reviews its overseas presence to determine which markets could prove the most valuable sources of FDI in the medium term. Global economic and geopolitical developments mean that the FDI landscape is changing in ways that require IDA to deepen and diversify its overseas presence. Doing so ensures appropriate and effective coverage of both industry sectors and geographies, in order that Ireland continues to capture a significant share of global investment flows which in turn, assists in the achievement of a variety of public policy goals in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Global Ireland 2025, IDA Ireland has expanded its presence in the United States in California, New York and Chicago; opened an office in Toronto; and, expanded its presence in Paris, Frankfurt and London.

This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence.

This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor, or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.\u00a0 Eligible homes are allocated on a first come, first served basis, and the average time between application and allocation to a contractor is now 22 months.\u00a0 The wait time is a result of strong demand for what is an extremely popular scheme. The work programme was also negatively\u00a0impacted by Covid-19, particularly between March and June when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver\u00a0more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced last month. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700091#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700091#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[44372\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700091#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of homes and premises in counties Laois and Offaly, respectively, that are still awaiting connection to broadband under the national broadband plan.","asker":"1491","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract signed in\u00a0November 2019 to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.

The NTA has advised customers to continue to only use public transport for necessary journeys and to avoid peak-time travel.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including front-line workers and students.  <\/p>  <p>  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[44461\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will ensure a substantial financial allocation under the road works programme to Cavan County Council in 2021 for the further planning and design of a route (details supplied) in view of its strategic importance for the Border region and the need to upgrade this road; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

In this context, both the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport &amp;amp; Media; and my Department have been liaising with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) since early May - 11 meetings have taken place, the most recent being the 27th November 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society. It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for public service obligation, PSO, services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector. <\/p>  <p>  These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on operators arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant state aid considerations. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support through contracts with the relevant operators.<\/p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of the year and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. <\/p>  <p>  Other measures introduced includes rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning coach tourism -  a fund of &euro;10m was made available under the July Stimulus package to assist the Coach Tourism sector. The Coach Tourism Business Continuity Scheme is administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and was open for applications up to 5th November 2020.

Small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators and small coach operators have been badly affected due to their dependence on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Limousine  and small coach operators, who are particularly dependent on overseas tourism and major events, have suffered a near total drop in demand for their services and many have been simply unable to work since the pandemic started in March.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports for affected businesses, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, available for business whose turnover has fallen 30% and liquidity and investment measures such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Other measures include rates waivers and business advisory supports.<\/p>  <p>  Many self-employed SPSV operators, including self-employed limousine drivers, have been able to avail of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which will remain open to new applicants for the remainder of the year and continue to be paid until April 2021. This is an important lifeline for SPSV operators. Many may have gone back to work as the economy began to reopen only to find that subsequent necessary public health measures have once again suppressed passenger demand for their services. The continued accessibility of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy, notably the hospitality industry.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 Budget has now put in place a number of substantial, sector-specific measures to support and strengthen the  tourism sector. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by over &euro;59 million or 36% over the initial 2020 allocation in Budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also been tasked with developing a Business Continuity Scheme to help coach tourism businesses through this very difficult period.  Further details on these measures and this scheme are available from my colleague, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin T.D.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), the SPSV industry regulator, also took a number of actions to aid SPSV operators, such as licence extensions and late renewal fee waivers. It has also engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. I remain committed to helping reduce the costs to SPSV operators, including limousine operators, and that is why my Department is providing the necessary funding to the NTA to enable it to waive annual vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":746,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM04900"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[44399\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM05000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if persons who had a code 78 applied to a D, D1 licence prior to 30 November 2013, and who also hold a manual category B licence may have the code 78 removed from their D, D1 licence without having to undertake a driver test, under the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 signed on 30 October 2020 transposing Directive (EU) 2020\/612.","asker":"1577","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":748,"content":"<p>The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 signed on 30 October 2020 transposing Directive (EU) 2020\/612 provides that where a person holds a manual driving licence in the category B, and obtained at any time from 30 November 2013, a certificate of competency in an automatic vehicle in any of the following categories BE, C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1 or D1E,  then that certificate can be regarded as a certificate of competency in a manual vehicle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Policy","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM05200"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[44426\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700092#WRM05300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when the strategy statements from the cycling officer in each local authority will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that each of our five cities has already developed cycle network strategies and these strategies form part of their overall metropolitan area transport strategies, and\/or are revised as those metropolitan area transport strategies are developed.  <\/p>  <p>  I was particularly pleased to be able to announce recently a new &euro;50m active travel allocation for 2021 for those local authorities outside of the five cities in order to support their work in the area of active travel infrastructure development and improvement.

It applies to businesses who, under the specific terms of the regulations, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict members of the public from accessing their business premises, with the result that the business is required to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels. Support provided under CRSS is intended to enable businesses to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period in which they are subject to such restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The design and operation of CRSS is centred around the concept of the &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; to which access is restricted under the Covid-related public health Regulations. The Regulations apply on a geographical basis and the premises must be located in the relevant geographical area. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of CRSS a business premises is defined in the legislation as being &ldquo;a building or other similar fixed physical structure from which a business activity is ordinarily carried on&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation further requires that &ldquo;applicable business restrictions provisions prohibit, or significantly restrict, members of the public from having access to the business premises in which the relevant business activity of the person is carried on&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  It is also not sufficient that a business is experiencing a reduction in demand for its goods or services because of Covid-19. To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, a business must, under the specific terms of the regulations, be required to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing its business premises.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that outdoor activity businesses, by their very nature, generally do not provide services in premises to which access is restricted. Therefore, they are not eligible for the CRSS and I have no plans to change this.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations .  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":778,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[44380\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to issues regarding a company (details supplied) and the application and administration of the temporary wage subsidy scheme which has resulted in employees not receiving payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1464","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":779,"content":"<p>The Irish economy and labour market have undergone an unprecedented shock in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, with nearly every sector negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.  In response, the Government introduced the wage subsidy schemes to maintain the link between the employee and employer insofar as is possible, as well as firm viability through a truly exceptional period.  To date, over &euro;4bn has been paid out to over 66,500 employers covering over 664,000 jobs in the State: an unprecedented scale to match the unprecedented challenge for our economy.  It is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses in the short-term, and so, the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy well into 2021 with additional sums in excess of &euro;1bn expected to be paid out by then.  <\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was in place from 26 March until 31 August 2020 and since then has been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which will be in place until 31 March 2021.<\/p>  <p>  By design, both schemes ultimately provide payments to employers to cover a portion of their wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  Payments to employers have been made as soon as possible after payroll, typically within 2 working days in order to minimise cashflow concerns. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to take up the scheme is ultimately a matter for the employer, and it is noted that the employer in question was included in the list of employers who availed of the TWSS which was published at the start of November.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, Revenue is statutorily bound to confidentiality in respect of taxpayer information and Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 prohibits Revenue from disclosing taxpayer information.   <\/p>  <p>  Therefore my comments relate only in general terms to the operation of the TWSS and the compliance checks conducted by Revenue on all employers who registered for and received funding under TWSS.    I would like to assure the Deputy that compliance checks were conducted by Revenue on employers who availed of TWSS to ensure TWSS was operated correctly.  I understand that, where any of the relevant criteria is not met, including if the employer received amounts under TWSS and the employer has not paid the subsidy amount to the specified employee, the employer will be required to refund these amounts to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  I would note that although the employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain as close to 100% of normal pay as possible for the duration of the subsidy period, both schemes are stand-alone measures based on clear and objective criteria that may be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Issues relating to an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, the wages an employer may be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and the employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees are all issues that are outside the remit of the schemes.  Those remain a matter between the employee and employer, governed by the relevant law and subject to the various checks and balances in place to ensure fairness to employees and employers.<\/p>  <p>  Individual employees can see the amount of TWSS claimed by their employer on their behalf and included in their wages\/salaries by examining their pay slip or by logging on to their Revenue myAccount.  Any specific queries in relation to the amount of subsidy received would be best raised by an individual with that individual&rsquo;s employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":780,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN01800"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[44493\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the planning being conducted by his Department to deal with the potential housing consequences vis-a-vis 30-year mortgages payable by persons in their late 60s and 70s when salary levels and job opportunities might decrease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>The consumer protection regulatory framework provides a significant number of protections and supports for borrowers of all ages who are in or facing mortgage arrears.  In particular, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at ensuring borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner. Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:<\/p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p>  <p>  There are also a number public initiatives to assist people who are in mortgage or other debt difficulty.

I am assuming that the Deputy, when referring to illegal cross-Border trade of household fuel products, is enquiring about the movement of home heating oils and solid fuel into the State from Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal mineral oils trade, including home heating oils, include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, a rigorous programme of risk focused enforcement action and the application of robust legislation. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud.  <\/p>  <p>  Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT) is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland. Solid fuel carbon tax is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, there is no carbon tax on solid fuel in Northern Ireland. This factor, combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate on solid fuel, lower environmental standards and currency fluctuations, can give rise to significant price differentials which incentivises the sourcing of solid fuel from Northern Ireland. EU Single Market constraints, which will still apply in Northern Ireland, preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of SFCT. This means that solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland is not subject to cross-border movement controls typical of harmonised excises on mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol. Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, Revenue has no authority to challenge transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland as such transportation or possession are not, in themselves, Revenue offences. Even if controls were possible, a person transporting solid fuel from Northern Ireland could legitimately claim that SFCT will be accounted for on relevant supplies made in the State. An SFCT return does not have to be made until one month after the end of the two-month accounting period in which the supply is made.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously highlighted to the Deputy, the collection of SFCT by Revenue is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regime is enforced by local authorities who have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling coal that does not meet these standards. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that at the beginning of 2020 Revenue participated in a number of &ldquo;joint operations&rdquo; within Low Smoke Zones in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and  Communications and local authority solid fuel inspection teams, with a view to checking for compliance across several tax headings, including SFCT. Revenue participated in these operations, based on the clear understanding of the statutory responsibilities of the agencies involved.  In addition, a SFCT compliance module has been included in Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing Mineral Oil Tax national compliance project. This project, along with many other field-based compliance activities, has been impacted by Covid-19 restrictions since mid-March.<\/p>  <p>  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes. I am aware that Revenue takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected and that this action is informed by intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the tobacco trade, I am advised that Revenue uses a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminality. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades has achieved a considerable level of success. I know that Revenue is very conscious of the resourcefulness of those involved and remains vigilant for, and ready to respond to, any new developments in these areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":805,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN04400"},{"type":"question","counter":806,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[44403\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700093#WRN04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the applications received for the Covid restrictions support scheme prior to the new guidelines for the scheme being issued in December 2020 will be assessed on the guidelines in place at the time of application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":807,"content":"<p>The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

It came into effect on 1 January 2011 on foot of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, as part of the Government&rsquo;s programme of financial emergency measures.<\/p><p>PSPR was designed in a progressive manner. This was achieved through bands and rates i.e. a pension is not subject to a single PSPR rate, but rather a pension is divided into bands and each band is subject to a particular rate. <\/p><p>The PSPR rates and exemption thresholds have always distinguished between those who retired before March 2012 and those who retired between 1 March 2012 and 1 April 2019, with the latter group&rsquo;s PSPR measures being less punitive. This is on the basis that the latter group retired with FEMPI reduced salaries reflected in the salary rates used to calculate their pensions, while the former group did not.  <\/p><p>The key points regarding the timing of unwinding of PSPR since 2015 are set out below:<\/p><p>- A three-stage partial reversal of PSPR was provided for in the FEMPI Act 2015, largely by increases in the exemption thresholds occurring on 1 January in each of the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.<\/p><p>- The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provided for the further lessening of the impact of PSPR from 1 January in each of the years 2019 and 2020, by way of either increases in the PSPR exemption threshold (for the pre-March 2012 retiree group) or a lessening of the percentage reduction rates (for the 1 March 20120 &ndash; 1 April 2019 retiree group).<\/p><p>Finally, section 27 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 required that no later than 31 December 2020, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would issue an order that would specify a date for the completion of the operation of PSPR from that residual group of PSPR-affected pensions. The Government recently decided, taking into account legal advice, that the operation of PSPR will be completed from 1 July 2021 on the basis that the reduction was required to be restored within a reasonable time, based on the provisions of the 2017 Act, and not later than this date. This means that PSPR will cease to apply to any public service pensions from 1 July next year.

The exceptions for the Christmas period are designed to support people to have a meaningful Christmas, albeit different to other years.

I understand the difficulties these restrictions pose for couples on their special day.

All local authorities have an established Severe Weather Assessment Team in place, monitoring Met &Eacute;ireann weather warnings and OPW EFAS advisory warnings and High Tide Advisories. Local authorities also have Severe Weather\/ Flood Plans in place to support the response to weather emergencies. <\/p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated changes in working practices, and my Department has made necessary changes and improvements, including providing a direct link for situation briefing between Met &Eacute;ireann's forecasting and flood forecasting division and the local authorities in advance of any predicted severe weather event. My Department also hosted a focus group, organised by Met &Eacute;ireann, in September 2020, where Met &Eacute;ireann shared updates regarding the development of flood forecasting and warning and updates in relation to the naming convention for storms and general weather warnings. <\/p><p>My Department undertakes the Lead Government Department role, as set out in the Strategic Emergency Management (SEM) Framework (2017), in relation to coordination of national level response to flooding emergencies, where warranted.

This is in recognition of the exceptional nature of activities carried out by local authorities in responding to these types of emergencies and the fact that the costs of these un-programmed activities cannot be met from within existing resources.  This practice is considered a vital enabler of local authority response, providing the assurance that availability of resources is not a limiting factor in providing a very effective local response.<\/p><p>In the context of the flooding which has occurred during 2020, the exceptional nature of the response activities carried out by local authorities, and the fact that the costs of these activities were not budgeted for within existing resources, requests were made to support the funding of the significant costs of the response, clean-up and necessary immediate works. My Department will be providing &euro;523,000 towards the costs incurred by local authorities to undertake un-programmed works associated with flooding events that have occurred in 2020.<\/p><p>In each flooding event, DEASP Humanitarian Aid for flooding is operational and available to persons affected. Small businesses impacted by flooding who do not have insurance may apply for assistance under the scheme activated by DBEI and operated through the Irish Red Cross. <\/p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is the lead organisation for flood risk management in Ireland.

The most recent reports were published in 2019 and can be accessed on my Department's NPWS website: <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Twenty-four species of cetacean have been recorded from Irish waters. Some of these species are common and widespread. Others (e.g. Blue whale, Sperm whale, beaked whales) show a preference for the deeper waters offshore and are rarely seen. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s marine mammals have been the focus of considerable research efforts over the last three decades and the understanding of species occurrence, abundance and distribution has improved markedly in that time. Most recently the ObSERVE project, run jointly by my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, mapped cetaceans through aerial and ship-based surveys over a three year period and across an extensive area of our off-shore waters. Discussions around further work in this regard are currently being finalised. <\/p><p>I share the Deputy's concerns around the impact on cetaceans in Irish waters from underwater noises and acoustic disturbance, including sonar. The hearing system of marine mammals is particularly susceptible to damage and the deep-diving beaked whale species are known to be especially vulnerable.<\/p><p>Underwater sound, for example seismic surveys, pile driving or chemical explosions, can cause significant disruption to the normal behaviour of marine mammal species and may lead to permanent or even lethal injury. In an early effort to address this issue, my Department, developed a &quot;Code of Practice for the Protection of Marine Mammals during Acoustic Seafloor Surveys in Irish Waters&quot; in August 2007.  <\/p><p>In 2014, the original Code of Practice was updated and a new guidance document, which provides a detailed overview of the issues and relevant mitigation measures in respect of man-made underwater noise, was published. This document [&quot;Guidance to Manage the Risk to Marine Mammals from Man-made Sound Sources in Irish Waters&quot;] is used extensively by the maritime industries in Ireland. It can be downloaded from the NPWS website: <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>In the context of its observations on the Department of Defence draft Statement of Strategy earlier this year, my Department highlighted the potential for sonar technology to damage marine wildlife. <\/p><p>The use of sonar technology by naval vessels has the potential to disturb, displace and even kill cetaceans. However, Ireland is not a NATO member and the Naval Service does not currently employ sonar technology in its operations. With this in mind, I intend to raise the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence with a view to a coordinated approach across Departments to help meet Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Habitats Directive and ensure adequate protection for marine mammals in our waters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700094#WRO06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700095#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[44224\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700095#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will work with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to ensure that the remaining tenants at a location (details supplied) are not evicted; if he will further explore taking the whole apartment block into public ownership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>As housing authorities, local authorities are responsible for the identification of the social housing need in their area.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner \/ co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.

In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. <\/p>  <p>  An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years.<\/p>  <p>  Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan. Full details of the scheme are available on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;75 million in Budget 2021 has been be allocated to a new National Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which will be introduced in 2021.  I intend to target this scheme at first time buyers including single persons, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, a limited equity stake would be taken in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying their new home with their available mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement is progressing with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the homes delivered under this scheme and the local authority led affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria.

Specifically these include the introduction of a \"use it or lose it\" condition for all planning appliations of 10 housing units or more and review and reform of the judicial review process.   My Department is working on the development of legislative proposals on both these elements. <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Housing and Planning and Development Bill 2019 which was published in late 2019 outlines a range of initial proposals in relation to the reform of the judicial review process within the Planning and Developments Acts.   This General Scheme was reflected in the Government's Legislation Programme Autumn Session 2020, among the list of the General Schemes to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.  However, given the range of other legislation before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, this was not progressed in 2020 and so is now expected in early 2021.  In tandem, my Department is engaging with the Department of Justice in the light of the Programme for Government Committment that such reforms should come into effect upon the establishment of the proposed Environmental and Planning Law Court, while always adhering to EU law obligations on public participation under the Aarhus Convention.  My Department is also considering the issues raised during a public consultation phase of the General Scheme, to inform the evolution of this piece of legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The \"use it or lose it\" proposals are being developed as separate legislative proposals.  This concept specifically arose from an external  review of the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) arrangements which enables planning applications of 100 housing units or more, or student accommodation or shared accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more, to be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) for determination.  In line with the Programme for Government commitment, these SHD arrangements will not be extended beyond their legislative expiry which is now February 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is presently in the early stages of developing the necessary legislation providing for the introduction of the proposed new \"use it or lose it\" housing-related planning arrangements. This will include consideration of any legislative amendments requried to support the process for winding up the SHD arrangements and their replacement with revised planning processes for large-scale housing developments.  My Department is currently engaging with stakeholders in this regard, and the legislative proposals will be progressed over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700095#WRP07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":971,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[44141\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the information his Department holds on the widely reported operations of a vessel (details supplied) and associated submarine activity in Irish waters and use of sonar around 27 July 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1468","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":972,"content":"<p>The Government is aware of the report made in July of this year by an Irish fishing vessel to the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency concerning a UK naval ship conducting an exercise off the North West coast of Donegal.<\/p><p>The location where the UK naval ship was conducting training exercises was not within Ireland&rsquo;s territorial sea and did not therefore infringe our sovereignty.<\/p><p>In general, it is not unusual for naval ships to ask other vessels in the vicinity to move away from an exercise location for safety reasons.<\/p><p>While advance notice from the UK authorities about the exercise would have been welcome, this was not a requirement and the UK authorities have not done anything out of the ordinary in this instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations Population Fund","counter":973,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[44205\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated funding that will be allocated to the United Nations Population Fund in 2021; if funding to same will increase between 2021 and 2030, inclusive, in line with the overall overseas development assistance budget increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":975,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[44206\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700096#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if funding was provided to the UNFPA Supplies, the United Nations Population Fund's thematic programme dedicated to expanding access to family planning in 2020; if he plans to allocate funding to this programme in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":976,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 361 together.<\/p><p>Ireland is the 14th largest core contributor to the United Nations Population Fund  (UNFPA) and the 24th largest contributor overall, in line with the priority which the Government's policy on international development, <i>A Better World<\/i>, attaches to gender.

Schools have put significant measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to\/within the school and significant funding has been provided to support schools in this respect.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the measures promoted by HPSC.<\/p>  <p>  The advice outlines the view of public health that given current knowledge about COVID-19 disease in children, it is difficult to justify cocooning in most children with underlying conditions. Long-term cocooning of children with complex medical needs is likely to adversely affect them and may outweigh the potential risk of infection. <\/p>  <p>  The HPSC advice goes on to advise that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also developed and prepared a comprehensive response to supporting the wellbeing of school communities at this time.

Services provided include door to door services on certain routes. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme supports may be available to assist with necessary travel costs.  The support can either be on a once-off basis as an exceptional needs payment or as a supplement where there is an ongoing need.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  At the end of 2019, 141 persons were in receipt of a Travel Supplement.  In addition, over 17,200 exceptional needs payments were made in 2019 to assist with travel costs, at a cost of almost &euro;1.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700098#WRS03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700098#WRS04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[44185\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700098#WRS04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on a carer's allowance review for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>An application for CA was received from the person concerned on 20 October 2020.<\/p><p>Following a request for further information, the evidence submitted in support of this application was examined.

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.  In this regard, Ireland is the only OECD country without a mandatory or automatic enrolment supplementary pension system.<\/p><p>The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is just over 50% of the working population (CSO, Pension Coverage Survey 2019) and this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Many of these people will become reliant on the State pension for all or most of their income in retirement and accordingly, may face a significant unwanted drop in income. <\/p><p>Although the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 to 2023 provided for the development and implementation of an Automatic Enrolment (AE) retirement savings system by 2022, this Government recognises the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are now under.  Therefore, the Government will now seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles: <\/p><p>- There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers. <\/p><p>- Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions. <\/p><p>- There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out. <\/p><p>- Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from. <\/p><p>- There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers. <\/p><p>A phased introduction of the system is believed to be achievable in the current situation. As part of this phased introduction, the Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office (AEPMO), based in my Department, is currently working on developing options for Government to consider in 2021.  There are five main areas where work is ongoing so as to produce design options.  These areas relate to: <\/p><p>- the scope and role of a central processing authority for the system; <\/p><p>- the nature and functions of registered providers of savings products; <\/p><p>- the investment framework and funds to be offered by registered providers, including the design of the default fund and the pay-out phase; <\/p><p>- the design of the State financial incentive; and <\/p><p>- the phasing of implementation.<\/p><p>In progressing this work, the Department is receiving technical support from the European Commission&rsquo;s DG Reform which assists EU member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms and this support will continue to be provided next year.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Interdepartmental &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Board&rsquo; will be meeting regularly in the coming months to provide the strategic direction for the development of the AE system.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700098#WRS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payment","counter":1155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700098#WRS04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1156,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[44276\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700098#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for an exceptional needs payment in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1157,"content":"<p>The person concerned submitted an application for an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) to my officials on 20\/11\/2020. <\/p><p>This application was refused as the person concerned had failed to provide all of the requested documentation.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness\/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).<\/p>  <p>   A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021 to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid- 2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.  In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700099#WRT05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1232,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[44203\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700099#WRT05800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when the Disability Act 2005 will be fully commenced.","asker":"1519","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1233,"content":"<p>The Disability Act (2005) has been commenced in full except for Part 2 which makes provision for an Assessment of Need.

The main function of the Inspector of Prisons is to carry out regular inspections of prisons and places of detention in Ireland.  The Inspector also investigates deaths of prisoners in custody and has oversight of the prisoner complaints procedure in the Irish Prison Service. <\/p>  <p>  The Inspector of Prisons is cognisant of the requirement for enhanced oversight during a pandemic when society in general is subject to restrictions on daily life and increased restrictions are placed on people in custody.  Such restrictions must be the least intrusive necessary to achieve the desired public health objectives and also be in place for the minimum time necessary.  Oversight is therefore essential in order to provide independent verification that the human rights of persons in custody are being respected and that national legislation is being adhered to. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to confirm to the Deputy that while no formal inspection by the Inspector of Prisons took place in 2020, the Inspector of Prisons visited every prison during the year to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in order to hear from as many prisoners as possible within the current public health restrictions in prisons, a journal was issued to a number of prisoners in custody in seven prisons.  The cohort of prisoners selected were being &lsquo;cocooned&rsquo; and the intent was to capture their &lsquo;lived experiences&rsquo; during this time.  The journal was left with the prisoners concerned for 14 days with the aid of the Prison Service Irish Red Cross volunteers in each of the prisons. In July 2020,  the Inspector published the related briefing note &ldquo;Ameliorating the impact of cocooning on people in custody &ndash; a briefing&rdquo; which aims to provide insight into how people in custody experienced cocooning. <\/p>  <p>  The Inspector of Prisons also spent three days in one prison in late April\/early May.  This afforded the Inspector the opportunity to speak with and directly hear the experiences of prisoners and staff during this time.  A report of this Monitoring Oversight Visit was submitted to my office on 5 August 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that  a significant amount of reports from the Inspector of Prisons have been published since 2014.

The discussions between officials from my Department and the industry representatives focused on improving the existing structures and processes to report and remove illegal content as well as what a future framework for tackling illegal content might look like. Other issues addressed the current model of self-regulation, alternative future models and what forms of illegal content should be covered by these mechanisms and models.<\/p><p>In July 2020, the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland (ISPAI) completed a rebranding of Hotline.ie and published a new Code of Practice for member companies.  The corporate rebranding, alongside changes made to the Code of Practice, demonstrates the broadening application of this national reporting service beyond traditional internet service providers to all parts of the tech industry.  <\/p><p>The new Hotline.ie Code of Practice features guidance on general good practice, clear and detailed 'Notice and Takedown' procedures for member companies, regulations regarding breaches of the code, complaints procedures, adjudication procedures as well as sanctions and remedies.<\/p><p>I have issued letters to 87 ISP companies, who are not currently Hotline.ie members, to encourage them to become members and to participate in this new Code of Practice. In addition, copies of the new Code of Practice, and a letter encouraging continued membership, was also sent to all current member companies. I understand that discussions are currently ongoing between Hotline.ie and a number of companies to finalise their membership. My Department is in the process of organising a targeted event, provisionally scheduled for Q1 2021, with a view to further highlighting the importance of corporate membership of the national reporting service. <\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that Action 13.3 of the Action Plan for Online Safety states &quot;We will engage with providers to extend the Garda blocking initiative to those providers with the largest share of the market&quot;. <\/p><p>The Garda Blocking Initiative (GBI) is a voluntary scheme, overseen by my Department, under which Irish ISPs and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate to block access to illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM), in accordance with provisions contained in the 2011 Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.<\/p><p>Under the scheme, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides ISPs with a list of websites verified by AGS as having been used in the distribution of material depicting the sexual abuse of children, defined as child pornography by Section 2 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended. The ISP's agree to block access to these web pages and any customer attempting to land on the page is instead redirected to a Garda stop page which outlines why access has been blocked and provides an email address for any related queries.  The purpose of preventing access to such pages is to protect consumers, including children, from viewing documented CSAM and to prevent the further exploitation of children who have already been abused and photographed. <\/p><p>The successful extension of the Garda Blocking Initiative (GBI) under Action 13.3 was a direct result of consultations organised by my Department with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Irish ISPs over a number of months in 2019. I am pleased that the Industry sign-up to the GBI has now increased from one ISP to seven. The seven ISPs between them hold over 90% of the market share for the provision of fixed broadband services across Ireland and over 95% of the retail mobile market. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have signed memoranda of understanding with each of the ISPs concerned. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na held an event on 10 February 2020 to officially launch the expansion of the scheme and to coincide with the 2020 Safer Internet Day on 11 February.<\/p><p>My Department maintains an active watching brief in relation to technology and policy developments associated with action 13.5 &ndash; addressing the need to explore the feasibility of proactively engaging in searches for CSAM online. While this action has been achieved, my Department remains open to further activity in this area, given the rapid evolution of the online space.<\/p><p>Prior to the launch of the Action Plan for Online Safety, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated Operation Ketch, an ongoing Child Protection operation, undertaken in cooperation with international partners. Operation Ketch involves targeting those who possess and distribute CSAM either through online platforms or via File Sharing Networks and sends the message to persons distributing CSAM that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will actively identify and pursue them.<\/p><p>Proactive search was an area of considerable discussion at EU and international level throughout 2019. My Department's engagement on this action was central to a site visit to the UK's Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and the UK Home Office in early 2019, and was a subject of discussions with the ISP Industry at my Department's event in May 2019.<\/p><p>Proactive searching is also a possible responsibility of the proposed European centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse, under the EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse, published in July 2020.<\/p><p>Given the above, and also taking account of the findings of an EU Commission study published last August, work is ongoing to examine the need to renew and repurpose the operational relationship of Hotline.ie with key stakeholders across a number of fronts.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Action 14.2 of the Action Plan for Online Safety commits to working with industry to publish regular transparency reports in relation to illegal and harmful content.<\/p><p>Under this action, my Department has responsibility for 'Illegal Content', while 'Harmful Content', as addressed in the recently published Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing in my Department under this action in relation to illegal content through preparations on the proposal for an EU Regulation on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online.

However, I can assure the Deputy that both my own Department and the GNIB are taking a pragmatic approach in relation to the enforcement of Deportation Orders during the current COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  If a Deportation Order is made, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.  In making a revocation request a person can raise new or changed circumstances in their case including in relation to their country of origin.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time. <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":1361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1362,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[44212\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a repayment under the nursing home support scheme 2009 is being requested (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1363,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1364,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1365,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[44289\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700101#WRV05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he plans to extend the pay restoration that has commenced for 50 section 39 organisations to the remaining 250 similar organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1366,"content":"<p>As we are aware, an agreement was reached by the parties in October 2018, in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed by 50 section 39 agencies, as part of a pilot exercise.

The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of November 2020 there were 4,186 patients waiting compared to 6,378 in November 2018.<\/p><p>In considering these figures it is important to recognise that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic this year.

Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. <\/p><p>As the Deputies can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.

Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.

The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 found that the net requirement in combination with health system reform is for an additional 2,590 hospital beds by 2031 (2,100 inpatient, 300 day case and 190 critical care). The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21.<\/p>  <p>  At the start of this year, permanent adult critical care capacity in our public hospitals stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, funding totalling &euro;52m was provided in budget 2021 for critical care beds. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,590 inpatient beds were required by 2031. <\/p>  <p>  Adding critical care capacity requires consideration of design and building timelines, disruption to existing services within the hospital, the on-site location of critical care facilities and the importance of maintaining relevant clinical adjacencies. Engagement has commenced between the Acute Hospitals Division, the Critical Care Programme and the Estates Division, and detailed assessments are underway in respect of each of the prioritised locations to determine the scope, scale and cost of the projects. The 2021 Capital Plan will include projects anticipated to complete in 2021 such as Phase 1 of a 112 bed development at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, which is also expected to provide 8 critical care beds, and 12 critical care beds at Tallaght University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to elective care, the Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, chaired by Professor Frank Keane, is preparing the preliminary business case for new dedicated ambulatory elective only hospital facilities in Dublin, Galway and Cork. These will provide high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis, together with a range of ambulatory diagnostic services.

After reviewing the acknowledged limited evidence base and lack of RCT data, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat COVID-19.

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of November 2020 there were 4,186 patients waiting compared to 6,378 in November 2018.<\/p><p>In considering these figures it is important to recognise that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic this year. The HSE had to take measures to defer most routine scheduled care activity in March, April, and May. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.<\/p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.<\/p><p>In addition the NTPF is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.<\/p><p>The cataract data requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents.

This is particularly important during the current pandemic. Covid has presented significant challenges for people&rsquo;s mental health, including increased stress, anxiety and fear.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the Government remains fully commitment to the continued development of mental health services across a broad continuum from mental health promotion to acute and specialist services. The approach taken reflects the over-arching principles of the widely agreed <i>Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/i>I am progressing the various mental health commitments reflected in our new national mental health policy <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>and those in the current Programme for Government. In addition, I have recently extended <i>Connecting for Life<\/i>, the national suicide reduction strategy, until 2024. <\/p><p>The inaugural meeting of the National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC), tasked with driving implementation of <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>was held on 11<sup>th<\/sup>December and work of associated Specialist Groups will commence in early 2021. As part of the work of the NIMC and Specialist Groups there will be a focus on reviewing current mental health inpatient capacity, including child, adolescent and adult beds. <\/p><p>The Government has invested significantly in the enhancement of mental health services. The Budget 2021 allocation for Mental Health, of &euro;1.076 billion, is an increase of &euro;50 million over 2020.  Of the additional &euro;50 million for 2021, &euro;23 million will be used to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations set out in <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>. This will fund an additional 153 staff in enhancing community mental health teams, including CAMHS, Clinical Care programmes, bereavement counselling, employment supports and Crisis Resolution. We have provided &euro;15 million specifically for Covid-related measures, including the provision of extra mental health beds, as required. Additional funding of &euro;2.2 million was provided earlier this year to the HSE to meet increased demands posed by Covid-19 by improving its psycho-social responses. <\/p><p>New approaches, such as those reflected in <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>and <i>Connecting for Life,<\/i>advocate a cross-departmental, whole-of-Government approach to delivering these policies. <\/p><p>While mental health care should be provided at the lowest possible level, not all mental health issues can be dealt with in the community. In-patient and residential care has, and will continue to have, an important role. The new 170-bed hospital complex in Portrane will replace the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum (93 beds) with a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service.  I am glad to say that the new legislation to open the new forensic mental health service in Portrane, which will become operational in 2021, was passed by the Oireachtas earlier this week.  Additional bed capacity for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) will be provided at the new hospital in Portrane, and at the new National Children's Hospital. We are also progressing improvements to other mental health infrastructure nationally.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Health and the HSE are finalising the 2021 HSE National Service Plan which will be published shortly. This will cover a comprehensive range of mental health service improvements - from promotion and early intervention to acute and forensic in-patient care to postvention supports at community level. It will also ensure that greater attention is given to better integration between mental health and other services within, or external to, the health sector. <\/p><p>On the legislative front, the Department of Health is nearing completion of an extensive overhaul of the Mental Health Act, 2001. The revised legislation will improve protection for the rights of all mental health service users, including provision for consent to treatment for 16-to-17 year olds in mental health services. The draft Heads of this legislation are expected to be finalised very shortly.  <\/p><p>The Deputy can rest assured that I will continue to pursue improvement across all aspects of our mental health legislation, policies and services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":1723,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[44632\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when access to counselling will be facilitated in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1724,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":1725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1726,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[44634\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position on the restoration of speech and language and other therapies for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1727,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recognises the need to improve services for both children and adults with disabilities through better implementation and by working together across Government in a better way. <\/p><p>The Government commits to prioritising early diagnosis and access to services for children and ensuring that the most effective interventions are provided for each child, to guarantee the best outcomes.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1729,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":1728,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1729,"qnumday":630,"qnumall":"[44152\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an area aid payment was made to a farmer (details supplied) in County Kerry prior to 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1730,"content":"<p>Further information is required in order to progress this query.

It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the importance of the sector and the number of jobs it supports in nurseries, harvesting, transportation and processing. I know that it has significant potential for income generation on farms, for the creation of rural jobs, and for the provision of woodlands for public enjoyment. It also has a key role to play in meeting our national climate change and biodiversity objectives.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department receives forestry applications and issues new licences every week. There are currently around 4,700 licences on hand for processing.  Some 2,000 licence applications require ecology input and, on which, a backlog has developed. The remaining 2,700 licence applications do not generally experience the same delays as the first group. By way of context on our output, we have issued 2,461 licences this year to date. Some 683 of these licences have issued since the introduction of the new Forestry legislation at the beginning of October and I am hopeful that this positive trend will continue. We continue to invest heavily in resources in order to achieve this. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of felling licences, over 1,600 felling licences have issued so far this year for almost 5 million cubic metres of timber. Licences for over 650,000m3 of timber were issued in November alone. The figure for October was over 760,000 m3. In relation to forest roads, almost 120km of new roads have been licensed so far in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that a felling licence can have a duration of up to 10 years. Our updates are based purely on our licensing output and we make no prediction of when the material will be harvested. The licensing of these areas does not mean that the entire area will be harvested immediately in that year but rather harvesting may be undertaken over the entire licensing period. This gives forest owners flexibility in the scheduling of harvesting operations. The 2019 output figures are somewhat unrepresentative as they include large quantities of thinning licences issued to Coillte last year which does not happen every year. <\/p>  <p>  A thinning licence is different to a clearfell licence in terms of available timber. This is why it is preferable to measure output in volume rather than hectares. This is a better measure of output as it is more meaningful for the sector in terms of available volume. We generally use a methodology to estimate total timber licensed by using an assumption of 70m3 per hectare for a thinning licence and 330m3 per hectare for a clearfell licence. In this regard, we would expect to licence around 5 million m3 this year as compared to 6.5 million m3  in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of tackling the backlog of licences that need ecology input, we are approaching this by means of continuous improvement and review with the aim of increasing the output of these licences on a weekly basis.  Adequate and appropriate resources are key. At the beginning of the year, there were just two ecologists working on ecology files but this figure is now sixteen. Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work.  This has delivered the increased output we have seen in October and November compared to other months this year. <\/p>  <p>  We also implemented significant changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. This is an increase from one Committee that was previously in existence.  Since putting these additional resources in place, the FAC has held 61 hearings and has 42 hearings scheduled for December.  This is significantly reforming how the FAC does its business and will result in a more fit-for-purpose, environmentally sensitive and sustainable forestry licensing process which serves all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  While there is still has some considerable way to go, I am encouraged by this progress and aim to sustain and build on this output of licences issued each week.  To this end, my Department will recruit additional ecologists and support staff in the New Year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB02792","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1748,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1749,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[44339\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure that pelagic mid-water pair trawling in boats of over 10 m is prohibited within 10 km of the coast in order to protect the inshore fishing fleet while allowing mid-sized boats that traditionally fished for species such as prawns and that do not have a capacity for fishing far offshore to continue fishing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1750,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, in December 2018, following a public consultation process in which over 900 submissions were received, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine announced that vessels over 18m will be excluded from trawling in inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1st January 2020.

The surveys conducted in 2019 included a targeted survey of forestry plantations and a systematic survey of National Forest Inventory points across the country. By the end of 2019, there had been findings in ash in over 650 locations in various settings &ndash; forests, nurseries and garden centres, on farm planting, roadside planting, hedgerows and private gardens in all 26 counties. <\/p><p>Systematic surveys for ash dieback have continued during 2020. Since the late 1980s, the Department has approved the planting of over 16,000 hectares of ash.  It is difficult to calculate the proportion of this area which is currently affected by ash dieback.  A very low proportion of the ash population will exhibit tolerance to the disease (1% to 2%). However, given that the disease is now considered endemic in Ireland, the potential exists for most ash to eventually be affected by ash dieback disease to varying degrees of severity.<\/p><p>The national response to Ash Dieback has moved away from eradication of the disease in light of experience and scientific evidence that such an approach is no longer feasible. Previous reconstitutions scheme for ash dieback have cost in the region of &euro;7m.  A new Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) was launched in June this year and focuses on ash plantation management. This approach categorises plantations into three groups based on the plantation age and tree size. Different support options are available, depending on the category into which the ash plantation may fall.<\/p><p>My Department is actively supporting a number of research projects into the control and management of Ash Dieback disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance. In this regard, a five-year project was begun in 2013, the aim of which has been to identify individual trees of ash which show tolerance to Ash Dieback and to use them for possible future breeding work and DNA screening by other institutes. <\/p><p>The project, which was part funded by the Department, was carried out by Forest Research, an agency of the Forestry Commission in the UK. The project involves 48 hectares of trial plantings over fourteen sites in the east of England and the mass screening of some 155,000 ash trees with fifteen different provenances from continental Europe, the UK and Ireland.  Over 14,000 Irish ash plants from two distinct seed lots were included in the trials. These trials continue to be monitored by Forest Research, while scion material showing early signs of tolerance has been repatriated back to Ireland and incorporated into the Teagasc research effort.  <\/p><p>The Department continues to closely follow similar work in Europe. Teagasc has collaborated with a number of European research agencies and has acquired and propagated ash genotypes which have been selected as putatively tolerant to ash dieback disease, having been observed as healthy over several years in infected locations with high tree mortality.<\/p><p>In 2020, with support from this Department under the Forest Genetic Resources Reproductive Material: Seed Stand &amp;amp; Seed Orchard, a collaboration between Teagasc and Coillte resulted in the establishment of the first conservation collection of putatively tolerant ash plants at a forest site in Co. Kilkenny. This planting will be monitored over the coming years in order to assess how tolerance of each genotype holds up.<\/p><p>Also in 2020, officials in this Department contributed to a COFORD Connect Note on ash dieback disease. This note provides a comprehensive background on the state of the disease in Ireland, and a strategy for generating sources of tolerant ash seeds and plants, and for mobilising this material for field planting.

While figures relating to seizures are maintained by the individual agencies and bodies involved, the system does not lend itself to the simple consolidation of national figures. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to deficiencies with identification, the normal process is to serve notices requiring the owner\/person-in-charge to rectify the situation - it is not usual practice to seize animals solely on the basis of a deficiency in identification. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are responsible for enforcing the Control of Horses Act 1996, and comprehensive statistics on straying horses seized under the Act are freely available from my Department.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":1771,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06100"},{"type":"question","counter":1772,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[44472\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06150","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to increase afforestation levels to 8,000 ha per year, as set out in the recently published Ag Climatise - A Roadmap towards Climate Neutrality, in view of the ongoing licensing crisis and the fact that afforestation rates for 2020 are currently only 2,000 ha; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1773,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[44474\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to provide for the necessary forestry licences to increase afforestation levels to 8,000 ha per year, given the Department is having difficulties processing licences for 2,000 ha per year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1774,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 647 and 648 together.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the impact the current forestry licensing delays are having on the sector and that these delays are a contributory factor in the downward trend in afforestation levels. It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog. Notwithstanding the current difficulties, over 4,000 hectares of licences have been approved for afforestation so far this year. <\/p>  <p>  The current difficulties have arisen because of changes to our Appropriate Assessment procedure in dealing with forestry licences, which has meant that a backlog of those requiring ecology input has developed.  We are focussed on tackling this by means of continuous improvement and review with the aim of increasing the output of these licences on a weekly basis.  Adequate and appropriate resources are key. At the beginning of the year, there were just two ecologists working on ecology files but this figure is now 16.  Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work.  This delivered increased output in October and November compared to other months this year and I expect these positive trends to continue into December and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  I also implemented significant changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. This is an increase from one Committee that was previously in existence.  Since putting these additional resources in place, the FAC has held 61 hearings and has 42 hearings scheduled for December.  This is significantly reforming how the FAC does its business and will result in a more fit-for-purpose, environmentally sensitive and sustainable forestry licensing process which serves all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  While there is still has some considerable way to go, I am encouraged by this progress and intend to sustain and build on this output of licences issued each week. To this end, my Department will recruit additional ecologists and support staff in the New Year.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to meet the ambitious target of 8,000 ha target of new planting per year, my Department will, among other things, need an efficient and properly functioning licensing system and this is our aim. Meeting this level of ambition will be challenging and will require re-engagement by private land-owners, particularly farmers, as well as engagement from public bodies with land-banks and support from the business community and society. We have set, as a priority, the re-engagement of farmers in forestry, particularly through a more farmer-friendly National Forestry Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The aim is that this new programme will highlight to farmers that forestry can represent a valuable and complementary income stream to an active farming enterprise.  The new Forestry Programme and the new CAP will provide opportunities to further align agricultural support schemes and forestry, to better integrate planting into the farming system, and to remove any barriers to uptake. Obviously an improved licensing system will be key to restoring confidence to farmers in forestry as a viable land use option. <\/p>  <p>  My aim is to resolve the current licensing difficulties so that the process can support a sustainable forestry model with increased levels of afforestation which will meet our economic, environmental and recreational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1775,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1776,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[44484\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of appeals the Forestry Appeals Committee is dealing with on a weekly basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1777,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[44486\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700107#WRBB06700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason divisions 2, 3 and 4 of the Forestry Appeals Committee are sitting only one day per week, given the urgent nature of the crisis in the forestry and timber industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1778,"content":"<p>The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) is independent in the performance of its functions and scheduling of appeal hearings is a matter for the Chairman of the FAC.
