Agreed.<\/p><p>We will move on to the B category of correspondence, which is from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up to previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first item of correspondence is No. 1965 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills on our meeting with Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board today.  The committee was made aware of this item at last week's meeting and we are formally noting it now.  It is important to stress, and we have to be very conscious today when we have the ETB in, that the Thorn report and, I think, the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has made it very clear, and I will read one sentence: <\/p><blockquote>Having regard to the ongoing investigation ... with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department's legal advice, at the planned meeting, we are in a position to provide the Committee with information and answers on matters in both Dr. Thorn and the C &amp;amp; AG reports, without providing a level of detail which could identify individuals or companies or their activities.<\/blockquote> <p>We are not going to compromise a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation here today, or any potential legal cases that could go from it.  I think we all understand that but I have to just make that point clear.  We will note and publish that.<\/p><p>The next correspondence is No. 1966 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing a copy of the Analysys Mason report on pricing and access arrangements for the metropolitan area network.  We will note that was published the day before the last meeting.  We are now noting this copy.  We did discuss that particular report the last day so we are noting this.  The Department already has published the actual report but we will publish the accompanying letter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Given that the publication of that report coincided with a significant reduction in the cost per metre of fibre, had it been published a year ago it would have or is likely to have brought that reduction at that point.

We are writing back to the Department on that specific issue.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1968 from the Valuation Office and pertains to the Harold's Cross stadium.  The Commissioner of Valuation has made it clear that there was no contact whatsoever with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine during the process of valuing Harold's Cross.  We have to accept that.  He put it clearly in black and white when he said it would be outside its remit and inappropriate to do so.  We will note and publish that.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1972, which was provided by BT at our meeting last week - it is a copy - where BT refers to the Analysys Mason report.  We will publish correspondence No. 1972, which we dealt with last week.  As I said, we have already acknowledged that the Analysys Mason report was published by the Department.  We will publish it on our website as people will want to follow it through our website.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1973 from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stating there were no communications whatsoever between his office, and the Department, and the Valuation Office in relation to the sale of Harold's Cross stadium.  We will note and publish this.  The Department is saying there was no contact so we have to accept that. <\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1974 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which provides information on the legislative basis for amending the broadband tender, the decision to extract 300,000 households from the tender and the expert opinion relied on for this.  We can note and we will publish this.  I want to put that on our work programme as an item we want to deal with.  I will make one comment about the letter that he actually sent to us.  It is a detailed letter.  We asked about the state aid issue.  At this point in time we know there is only one tenderer still on the pitch - I will just call it that way - but it had not been formally categorised as the preferred tenderer at this point.  We asked about state aid and I will quote from the second paragraph of page 6 of his letter: <\/p><blockquote>A formal State aid notification has not yet been submitted to the EU Commission and a formal decision by the Commission in respect of the notified measure has not, therefore, been made, as this can only be done after preferred bidder stage of the procurement process. <\/blockquote> <p>In terms of the broadband issue, which we will come back to because I am putting it on the work programme, the state aid issue, the European Commission has not given its approval yet for this project because they got to see the details of the tender and the preferred bidder, and what is involved.  So we are a little bit away, one way or the other.  It still has to go to Europe after that stage.  We will just park that and publish this because we want to deal with the broadband issue and the work programme in a few minutes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#B00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>There is one further aspect to this on which it would be useful to have clarification and which arose on a number of occasions last week.  I refer to the mapping process and the possibility of duplication.  I think we can go back to them and ask them just exactly what has been mapped because there are public entities that have fibre like the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  We need to know if they have been included in the mapping process because after all, it would all be public money.  As it is for the avoidance of duplication, that would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#B00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Fine and  I thank the Deputy.  An attachment came with the letter with the heading, national broadband plan state aid compliance update on the mapping of Eir's rural extension plan, dated 8 March 2017.  There is a suggestion that we do not publish this because it is marked privileged and confidential.  However, they have redacted sections of the report, produced by PwC, on pages 6, 7 and 8, obviously in relation to matters that could be commercially sensitive.  I propose that we double check with them that we can publish the redacted form.  We can deal with the redacted issues separately.  From my reading of this report, they have obviously redacted the bits that they consider sensitive.  We will get clearance to publish the redacted version of that appendix that came with that letter as well.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1977 from the HSE, providing a note requested by the committee regarding the involvement of PricewaterhouseCoopers with BAM.  The HSE advises that there is a framework in place for the provision of professional services to assist in the programme for health service improvement.  The framework provides resourcing and expertise to be drawn down from PwC as required.  So we will note and publish this letter.  The HSE is saying that as far as it is concerned, there is no accounting.  That is its position.  We note and publish that.<\/p><p> No. 1980B is from the office of the Secretary General of Department of Finance stating that he is unavailable for a meeting on 7 March 2019.  We now have Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, coming to that meeting.  We will reschedule for the Department of Finance as soon as practicable thereafter.  The cancellation suited the other meeting.  That is noted and published.<\/p><p> No. 1981B is from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It provides an update to a query raised by the committee on agreeing a contract for the position of chief executive of the authority.  The authority advises that a contract has been concluded under terms and conditions approved by the Minister.  We will note and publish that.  We had a particular query on that.<\/p><p> No. 1983B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on his attendance at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting to discuss the oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Mr. Watt is making himself available to the committee on 7 March.  He has drawn attention to three other invitations from other Oireachtas committees.  He has also drawn attention to Standing Order 84(2), an internal Oireachtas Standing Order.  Members will be aware of this and should keep it in mind in terms of how we proceed.  While we all agree duplication should be avoided, the committee has never relied on Standing Order 84(2).<\/p><p> We should deal with the other letters.  Essentially, I want to make one thing clear.  We have already discussed - it was noted at our previous meeting - the position when we decided to invite Robert Watt before the committee.  We specifically framed the invitation around oversight and implementation of capital projects.  We want to know the governance and oversight arrangements.  We made no reference to the children's hospital.  That would have been specific to the Joint Committee on Health and a different Accounting Officer.  It is the case that major capital projects will be asked about on the day he comes in, including broadband, Luas lines, light rail, schools and so on.  Our invitation was not specific to the children's hospital.  He is coming before the committee to discuss oversight and implementation of capital projects.  He has asked our committee to notify the other three committee chairmen of this issue even though they were copied with the correspondence.<\/p><p> At this stage - I appeal to committee members to bear with me - we have received letters from two other committees on this issue.  I want to note No. 1990B.  It is a copy of a letter from Deputy Colm Brophy, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, to Robert Watt.  His letter to us says his committee invitation predated our invitation.  I note in that letter of invitation to Robert Watt he discussed twice the issue of health expenditure and the national children's hospital.  He was specifically asking about the children's hospital.  We did not ask about that.  We asked about overall capital project oversight and implementation and governance of capital projects.  I can understand that he might not want to talk on a matter that is specific to one Department.  That is a matter between him and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.<\/p><p> There is also a letter on file from Deputy John McGuinness, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  He also says in a letter to Mr. Robert Watt dated 19 February that he accepts the prospect of meeting all four committees on different issues or different aspects of the national children's hospital might be regarded as unduly onerous.  He accepts there should not be duplication.  However, I want to make it clear that we never invited Robert Watt specifically on the national children's hospital.  It is not right to suggest that we were asking about the children's hospital.<\/p><p> I propose to notify the other committees that our meeting is going ahead.  We note their specific references to the national children's hospital.  That is a different issue from what our meeting is about.  The purpose of the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in particular is different.  I imagine Mr. Watt is accountable to that committee.  That committee can deal with Mr. Watt in due course.<\/p><p> We will not get into political argy-bargy with other committees but we have letters and we are proceeding.  The wording of the invitation from other committees to Mr. Watt is a matter for them.  Our invitation is different and he is coming before this committee.  Other committees can take it up with Mr. Watt in due course in their manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#B00800","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I remember well the context because I proposed the approach.  It was in the context of discussing the national children's hospital overrun that we considered how the process could lead to a repeat of the difficulties in other projects if we did not have some understanding of what happened.  It was surely around process.  In fact, it was not only the Secretary General we invited.  We also specifically made the request to the person who headed up the procurement section.  Essentially, it appeared that there was quite rigorous oversight on procurement from that section when it came to purchasing things.  We need to understand that role from the point of view of big capital projects.  There appears to be a gap in our scrutiny from an institutional point of view, and the idea is to tease out that particular aspect.  It is critical not only that Mr. Watt comes before the committee but that we understand this from the broader perspective.  We also need to understand it from the perspective of the head of the procurement office.  If there is an institutional gap, then there is a process failure and it cannot but repeat itself.  It is both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#C00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>For housekeeping purposes at this stage we will note and publish the letter from Robert Watt, No. 1983B and the letter from Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, No.1984B.

I realise we are dealing with the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will deal with that in a moment.  I raised this matter at the last meeting and I need your guidance, Chairman, on how we will proceed with it now.  When we first dealt with this we discussed the matter with the Secretary General of the Department, his officials and members of the board.  At the time, we did not have any of the minutes of the board meetings or the sub-committee meetings.  We got those after the fact.  We did not have the reports from the independent examination carried out.  As it happens, they shed some light on some of the issues.  Again, we had a false meeting whereby we had the Accounting Officer and the board before the committee but we did not have the information we now have.  That would have enabled us to put the questions that we can now put.  I suggest we get them back in again, because we are now armed with the information.<\/p> <p>  It may serve as an example to other Accounting Officers in the sense that when this happens we are not going to accept being kept in the dark about reports or accept having to drag information out of people.  They come in and we do not get a chance to put questions that we should be able to put because we do not have the information.  We need to think about this.  Many of these issues centre around boards making decisions on information they do not have.  The Committee of Public Accounts ends up in exactly the same position.  Even after the fact, we do not get information to allow us to do our work.  That is a strong point that we should make in response to the correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt will come before the committee.  I realise there are sectoral committees.  I have no inclination, nor do other members of the committee, to step on the toes of any sectoral committee.  However, if we are to be honest, there is an element of jockeying for position from some of the committees.  Those sectoral committees have a job to do and good luck to them.  They can bring in Ministers.  We do not seek to bring in any Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#C00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>They can bring in Secretaries General too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Yes, but primarily the Minister is responsible to the sectoral committees.

We are dealing with issues to do with process failures, systems failures and procedural failures, all of which fall under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There are times of course when they also fall under the remit of sectoral committees but let the Minister come before those committees with his or her officials and deal with them.  We have to do our job as well.  I do not think we should accept that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  I am not criticising you, Chairman, but I learned in the media at the weekend that there was an invitation or offer being made to other committees to sit with us to discuss some of these issues.

The Accounting Officer did not sit on the board, Mr. Quinn did and he is the person who must answer the questions.  How can the Accounting Officer answer questions for somebody who sat on the board?  That is not going to happen.  We should write back to Mr. Quinn, thanking him for his response but insisting that we want him here along with the Accounting Officer.  We should set a session aside for the board to appear again with the Secretary General of the Department so we can put the questions we should have been able to put to them the last time.

I have a couple of observations.  Obviously, these letters from Mr. Quinn and Mr. Watt are co-ordinated.  We asked Mr. Quinn specific questions.  He writes: &quot;I refer to your letters of 8 and 12 February.  I will respond to the issues raised therein in due course.&quot;  It is a bit worrying that he has not responded already.  He should be able to answer these questions pretty quickly.  I would have thought they are pretty basic questions.  Why has it taken so long?<\/p><p>I want to emphasise that as a committee we do not bring Ministers before us.  I think that has only happened once.  Dealing with this issue is definitely within our remit.  Mr. Watt's letter reads:<\/p><blockquote>I understand that you have also invited Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, Office of Government Procurement, which is a Division of my Department, to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  As is normal, I will notify the Committee secretariat of the departmental officials attending with me in advance of the meeting.<\/blockquote> <p>To whom is it &quot;normal&quot;?  It is not normal to us.  When we invite certain Departments and Accounting Officers, they can bring whoever they want.  On many occasions, however, we have asked specifically for certain officials.  This is not just about the national children's hospital.  The gentleman in question is head of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  While the OGP is within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it is an office in its own right.  Mr. Quinn is the most senior procurement officer in the country.  We are concerned with issues about the children's hospital and how it was dealt with, but there is a wider issue concerning processes which we need to investigate.  If what has happened with the children's hospital is in any way exemplary, there are wider process issues in the way major contracts are awarded, dealt with and managed.<\/p><p>Mr. Watt will appear before the committee.  We must specifically insist that the head of the Office of Government Procurement appears as well.  I do not mind whether he appears with Mr. Watt or in a separate session.  In fact, appearing in a separate session might be a good thing.  It is for this committee to decide which sessions we want people to attend, not for anybody else.  We decide the format of our meetings.<\/p><p>In addition, as part of this discussion we need to hear from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement.  We will obviously ask questions concerning the hospital, but we should also ask about the process that is followed with all other projects.<\/p><p>It is the full-time job of several officials in the Department of Health to manage the health Vote.

We will note and publish the correspondence.  In addition to it, there is an attachment, item No. 1985(2)B that deals with the report on employer contributions under the single public service pension scheme which some people will find interesting.  Now that the public service has moved to the single public service pension scheme there are issues as to whether some State bodies are included in the scheme.  The report confirms that relevant authorities - confirmed as being authorities mainly financed directly or indirectly from the Central Fund - do not have to make employer PRSI contributions.  The report lists various bodies in the schedule, Appendix No. 1, which we will publish.  Appendix No. 2 deals with 24 bodies which have been confirmed as mainly self-financing but which are liable for the making of single scheme employer contributions.  The 24 bodies include the National Milk Agency, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported that they should have been making contributions since the Act was passed in 2013.  Some of the bodies have made provision for the contributions, but the last paragraph on page 4 is disconcerting.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>In total, 20 bodies have agreed to remit arrears in respect of prior years.  However, there are four public service bodies that did not provide an employer contribution for pre-existing public service pension schemes, but are deemed liable for employer contributions under the Single Scheme.  These bodies did not set aside amounts to meet the Single Scheme employer contributions.  These are the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), the Dental Council and the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAl).  Issues arising in respect of the payment of arrears of employer contributions by these bodies are currently under consideration.<\/blockquote> <p>The committee will ask that the issue be dealt with and finalised in the current year.

Somewhere along the line, a good while ago, we decided that it was strictly turnabout so I sat back then and just waited for my name to pop up.  Sure enough it has not been popping up and that just occurred to me but I got a call last week to ask if I would be second speaker on a particular matter so I agreed and I asked the member of secretariat who called me what way that works now.  I was informed that some members had expressed a special interest in a particular matter so they were the leads on that.  I said that I did not really realise that rule had been reintroduced and if that is the rule that is fine, we will all be up early in the morning and pick the meetings that we want to be leads on.  I certainly would have had an interest in the Irish Prison Service, for example, and I stayed on that evening to get extra time and that is fine.  However, funnily enough I was told at that meeting that I was pencilled in to lead on the meeting of 7 March and I noticed that two colleagues are in for 7 March, ironically from the same party as me but I am sure that is coincidental.  The identity of the witness for that meeting is not being lost on me and it is probably appropriate to mention the contents of a newspaper article last Sunday about a report being commissioned by two other committees which seemed to be about this committee and something of a co-ordinated effort to question the Committee of Public Accounts, its remit, its performance, the styles of individuals and all of that kind of stuff.

In the afternoon we will look at housing issues in connection with the appropriation account of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government when we will be joined by representatives of the Irish Council for Social Housing and the approved housing body interim regulatory committee.  First, we will examine the 2015 financial statements of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, as well as the supplementary report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Thorn report on that ETB.  It is very unusual for us to look at accounts that are more than three years old.  We have been in correspondence with the Department of Education and Skills which has stated sets of accounts and the report have been sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its attention.  I understand an investigation is ongoing.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we proceed in a manner which will not undermine the investigation in any way.  I ask for the co-operation of members and witnesses in that regard.  The reports in their entirety have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  What is being investigated by it is not for discussion here.  I, therefore, ask members not to ask anything about the Garda investigation.  Even if pressed, the witnesses are not to answer questions on matters subject to Garda investigation and should not feel pressurised to do so.  I will intervene to make sure nothing happens here to compromise the investigation or proceedings that may follow from it.  I will not allow the Committee of Public Accounts to compromise such proceedings.  We will have to be quite strict in that regard, but I believe everybody understands the seriousness of the matter.  <\/p><p>We are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General; Mr. Hubert Loftus, Mr. Gary O Doherty, Ms Martina Mannion, and Mr. Phil O'Flaherty.  From Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board we are joined by Mr. Noel Merrick, chairperson; Dr. Rory O'Toole, director of schools; Mr. Joe Kelly, director of organisation support and development; Ms Caitriona Murphy, director of further education and training; and Dr Deirdre Keyes, chief executive.  <\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones fully.  Merely leaving them in silent mode will not prevent them from interfering with the recording and broadcasting systems.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  That sentence could not be more significant.  They have absolute privilege which is not to be abused.  That is very relevant in the light of the Garda investigation.  Nobody should attempt to abuse the privilege attached to proceedings in the Oireachtas.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Again, I stress the importance of that sentence.  I am not talking about names being mentioned, but I cannot allow lines of questioning that seek to identify a person or an organisation.  We cannot go there.  It is a standing rule, but we must be absolute and strict in applying it today.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. <\/p><p>We will now hear opening statements from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, and Dr. Keyes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#L00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550739600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>As members will recall, I have outlined to the committee on a number of occasions the broad events that gave rise to the delay in carrying out and completing the audit of the financial statements for Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board for 2015.  In the end, we were only able to complete the work in December last year.  I have prepared a supplementary report on the relevant events, in addition to the normal format audit opinion, as provided for in section 7(4) of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.<\/p><p>The report deals with serious lapses in controls over procurement of a number of capital projects and certain other expenses in KWETB during 2015.  In that year, the ETB had receipts of over &euro;111 million and expenditure of &euro;109 million.<\/p><p> Some further context may be helpful to the committee.  Members will recall that the ETBs were established in July 2013, usually involving the amalgamation of two, and in some cases three, of the previous vocational education committees, VECs.  In addition, they took over the operation of training centres from the then F&Aacute;S.  The first period of account for the boards covered 18 months to the end of 2014, but there were delays in agreeing the format of accounts, a matter that was not settled until around October 2015.  In addition, new boards were appointed following the local elections held in May 2014 and there were further delays in some boards in appointing audit, risk and finance committees.  A new code of practice for governance of the ETBs was only issued in March 2015.  The combined result was a sector-wide delay in completion of the first cycle of audited financial statements, with knock-on delays for the 2015 statements.<\/p><p> We commenced the audit of the 2015 financial statements in January 2017.  In the course of the audit testing, audit team members identified concerns about certain procurements, project cost overruns and propriety matters.  A formal query on these matters was issued to the then chief executive of KWETB in June 2017.  The information and supporting documentation provided by KWETB in response to the audit query were assessed as being inadequate.  This was unsatisfactory, and so those matters of concern were brought directly to the attention first of the then chair and vice chair of the board and the chair of the audit committee of KWETB and, shortly thereafter, to the attention of the Department of Education and Skills.  The audit of the 2015 financial statements was suspended pending the outcome of any action the board or the Department might take.<\/p><p> In October 2017, the Minister appointed a statutory inspector to investigate the matters raised from the audit and some other matters that the Department had been separately pursuing with KWETB.  Arising from that inspection, a number of issues have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister has issued a statutory direction to the board about the implementation of a corporate governance action plan developed on foot of the statutory inspector's report.<\/p><p> We recommenced the audit process in April 2018 and reissued the audit query.  Fresh responses to the questions we raised were provided by the new chief executive, and these are reflected in the supplementary report and the statement on internal control.<\/p><p> Given the ongoing Garda investigation, I do not propose to recite the details of the specific instances of concern picked up by the audit.  More generally, the report concludes that the board was unable to challenge the KWETB executive in an effective way during 2015.  Underlying causes for this include incomplete information being provided to the board, delay in the establishment and functioning of statutory sub-committees and a lack of internal audit resources.  An effective process for review of internal controls was not in place.  Steps are being taken by KWETB to address these weaknesses.<\/p><p> It may also be useful to consider whether there are lessons to be learned generally for the ETB sector as a whole.  For example, while a key function of the boards of ETBs is oversight of their executives, they are heavily dependent on the same executives in the exercise of that function.  It may be worth considering whether, and to what extent, boards should have operational independence of the executives.  The committee will recall in recent months noting that, in issuing their 2017 financial statements, boards across the sector were critical of the level of resources available for internal audit and of the adequacy of the financial management systems they inherited from their predecessor VECs and with which they continue to operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and call Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#M00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550739600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I will shorten my opening statement as I go.  I am joined by colleagues who have already been introduced.  My opening statement will focus on two areas, those being, the background to the circumstances of this audit report and the Thorn investigation, and the supports and oversight arrangements that the Department has put in place to support the sector in implementing good governance practices.<\/p> <p>  I advised the committee by way of correspondence in September 2018 that the Department was in receipt of the final report from Dr. Thorn, which was published last September.  I also advised the committee of directions issued to the ETB.<\/p> <p>  When we received from the Comptroller and Auditor General the 2015 financial statements and this audit report on 15 January, we considered them and arranged for the laying of them before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 February.  The Department intends to co-operate fully with the committee on issues contained with the report while also recognising, as the Chair has indicated, the ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We trust that the committee understands that, while our commitment and willingness to be open and transparent on all matters relating to the issues, including the publication of the Dr. Thorn report in September, are clear, we are also required to give careful consideration to public engagement on the issues.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be clear - the issues that arise in KWETB are of serious concern to the Department.  The responses that the Department received at the time of our initial engagement with the ETB in 2017 pointed to ineffective governance and accountability, particularly in respect of the use of public resources.  For that reason, the Minister appointed an independent investigator under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, signalling that this was something that we considered warranted a serious response from the Department and that, when conducted under the legislation that created the ETBs, also permitted the Minister to take necessary action and direct the ETB to take appropriate steps to rectify any issue of concern that may have been found.<\/p> <p>  The investigator was given terms of reference by the Department to investigate all matters relating to issues of concern.  These broad terms of reference allowed the investigator to review any other matter that came to his attention in the course of the investigation.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Thorn made a number of findings.  The committee will be aware that his report is included in an appendix to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In summary, Dr. Thorn found that, regarding the ETB's governance procedures, adequate arrangements to manage procurement and conflicts of interest were in place according to documented procedures.  On an operative basis, however, the implementation of procurement processes and management of projects in several instances was found to be flawed or suboptimal.  He further found that the board of the ETB should have been more proactive in ensuring oversight of its management of projects.<\/p> <p>  The Department issued his report to the board of the ETB.  The board fully accepted the findings and set out an action plan.  The Minister, acting under his powers by virtue of section 41 of the ETB Act, issued directions with which the board was required to comply.  These directions included a request for the board to review the initial action plan presented to the Department in light of Dr. Thorn's findings and to implement a final action plan, to be agreed with the Department.  The board was also required to review the measures in place in the ETB to prevent conflicts of interest and inappropriate interventions in processes relating to procurement, contract and project management, and to provide mandatory governance training to new and existing board members.  The board was also required to conduct a self-evaluation with appropriately qualified external input and to provide regular updates to the Department.<\/p> <p>  Having actively engaged with KWETB since the Thorn report, the Department is aware that the board, the new chief executive and the executive staff are adopting a pro-active approach to improving governance arrangements and addressing matters of concern.  The ETB has provided the Department and, I understand, the committee with an update on its corporate governance programme, which incorporates the updated action plan.  This identifies a robust programme covering not just the directions issued by the Minister, but other governance matters considered by the board to support good governance.  The ETB has indicated to the Department its intention to revise this plan further to take account of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the revised code of governance for the ETBs, which was updated and issued in January.<\/p> <p>  Regarding supports and oversight arrangements for the sector as a whole, the ETB sector has undergone significant reforms in recent years.  The decisions to move from 33 VECs to 16 ETBs, to incorporate new responsibilities for training provision and to establish SOLAS have seen unprecedented change, with consequential structures and support mechanisms needed to support them.  These changes include: a legislative reform programme; a governance reform programme; the placing of internal audit on a statutory basis; and the establishment of Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, as the national representative body for the sector, which plays a critical role in the Department's reform programme for ETBs and the development and implementation of sectoral policies and arrangements for ETBs.<\/p><p> Another important change is the way in which the ETBs prepare financial statements.  They are now on a calendar-year basis and use a common and agreed template to ensure consistency of reporting and layout in that presentation.  The Department acknowledges that there had been delays in ETBs submitting their financial statements ahead of statutory deadlines, and significant progress has been made in recent years.  In the case of ETBs the statutory deadline for accounts is 1 April.  All ETBs submitted their draft statements for 2017 by that date in 2018.  In respect of 2018, the Department has been engaging closely with the sector to continue to impress upon it the need for continued compliance regarding the submission and the monitoring of progress.  The progress made since the establishment of the ETBs can also be assessed by the average time it took them to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which has reduced significantly.<\/p><p> In more recent times the Department has focused on practical arrangements which support good governance in the sector, including the planned roll-out of shared payroll and financial services, the creation of a dedicated public service reform function in ETBI, putting in place a national procurement policy for the sector and enhancing supports on building and capital projects.<\/p><p> Regarding payroll and financial services, work is under way to move the ETB payroll and finance systems to a shared services model.  When the VECs were first amalgamated, work was undertaken to merge and stabilise existing payroll and finance systems in the newly established ETBs and to implement some interim projects to support them in the introduction of shared services.  In tandem, business cases were prepared and signed off to support the investment required in implementing new payroll and finance shared services systems in the sector.  The procurement phase for the payroll project was completed in 2018.  Procurement for the ETB finance project is under way.  The roll-out of the payroll project will commence in the second quarter of 2019 and is to be completed over the next two years.  It is envisaged that the roll-out of the finance project will commence in 2020 and conclude the following year.<\/p><p> A reform function was established in ETBI in September 2010 with procurement as one of its key initiatives.  Furthermore, a legal services unit based in ETBI was established in 2016.  The unit has developed a legal services framework for the ETB sector in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  The unit has resolved approximately 130 queries from ETBs and has developed a log of legal queries which enables the provision of management information.<\/p><p> The ETB sector continues to have high levels of participation in national contracts and frameworks.  In addition to individual ETBs utilising OGP contracts and frameworks, the sector has developed ETB-specific frameworks.<\/p><p> As for governance and compliance, a national procurement policy for ETBs was put in place in 2018.  In addition, this year will see the roll-out of a new corporate procurement plan template for ETBs and the development of a sectoral multi-annual procurement plan, which will help identify goods and services that require public procurement due to aggregation thresholds.  Upskilling of staff across the ETB sector is also being supported.<\/p><p> Another key area is better governance in capital and building projects.  Better lead-in periods are important in the context of ensuring projects are delivered in a manner that is fully compliant with Department requirements.  The summer works scheme is one example of this, and better lead-in times are now being provided.<\/p><p> The Department has established supports for the sector.  The Department's technical guidance documents and design team procedures provide ETBs with clear guidance on how school building projects should be designed and delivered, including in respect of procurement; the Department's planning and building unit provides designated contact points to provide support, guidance and advice to ETBs; and the Department is facilitating ETBs with access to project managers.<\/p><p> Regarding control procedures, prior to a major project being devolved to an ETB, a service level agreement is put in place between the Department and the ETB.  This agreement sets out in detail the governance arrangements for the project.  As part of these arrangements, at least two separate meetings must take place between the Department, the ETB and their design teams.  Through these meetings, and at other key decision points, both administrative and technical staff within the Department review the progress of the project.  Under the service level agreement, SLA, the ETB is required to submit monthly project progress reports to the Department which must bring to the Department's attention any issues that have arisen with the project.  The Department also sets limits for the ETB and its design team in respect of change orders.  The final account for the project must also be sent to the Department to ensure that the final cost is in line with the tender outcome.<\/p><p> As for smaller-scale projects, new enhanced project control procedures were introduced in May 2016.  These procedures require two additional interactions with the Department during project delivery.  The first is a requirement to seek approval to lodge planning permission, and the second is a requirement to seek approval to place a contract for construction.  These additional interactions with the ETBs provide additional oversight and assurance that individual projects are delivered in accordance with the project brief.  Further strengthening of these procedures took place from January 2018 with the submission of tender reports for smaller-scale projects together with itemised pricing documents.<\/p><p> The Department carries out an annual programme of compliance checks among schools and ETBs of around 120 devolved projects.  This involves visits to schools and ETBs and the checking of supporting documentation.  While these checks can identify issues with individual projects, the overall feedback on compliance is positive.  The outcome from this is made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p> Change is ongoing and will take a number of years to embed; the new ETBs continue to develop as single entities, adapting organisational structures and practices accordingly and developing their response to their new responsibility for training.  There is a demanding reform programme that is bringing measurable benefits to the sector and at the end of which we expect to have robust structures that will enable ETBs and SOLAS to benefit from the economies of scale generated by the reform programme and to deliver top-class education and training services to the public.<\/p><p> We also have a robust governance regime, which helps to support ETBs to embed good governance practice in the sector.  However, we are conscious that, notwithstanding having codes, policies and tools to support good governance, both the Thorn and  Comptroller and Auditor General reports provide broader lessons for the sector and the Department, particularly in areas of procurement and governance.  We remain open and willing to learn from these issues and to adapt and enhance our existing reform and governance measures.<\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions from the committee on matters arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board was established in 2013 under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act.  Its primary function under this Act is the better co-ordination and delivery of education and training in counties Kildare and Wicklow.  Equally, of no less importance is the regulation of that co-ordination and delivery in line with the statutory requirements of Government, in particular the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ETB Act of 2013, the code of practice for the governance of ETBs, formerly of 2015 but replaced by the current circular of January 2019, Department circulars and ministerial directions that apply from time to time provide the regulatory framework under which we are obliged to operate.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the co-ordination and delivery of our education and training services, KWETB in 2015 was in receipt of circa &euro;111 million.  In 2016 and 2017 the allocation to KWETB grew to &euro;115 million and &euro;130 million, respectively.  In 2018 the total budget was &euro;135 million.  Almost 70% is allocated to salaries, with KWETB employing 2,572 staff, the majority of whom are teachers, tutors and support persons to our services and schools.  Our learners are the centre of our work.  We currently have 12,453 primary and post-primary students and circa 10,000 learners in further education and training.  KWETB has been a leading and innovative provider of education and training and is integral to the fabric of the communities in Kildare and Wicklow, both rural and urban, through the presence of our 25 schools - primary and post-primary - and one institute of further education.  Our further education and training is delivered in 25 centres and through various contracted training programmes, including apprenticeships.  We are responsible for the provision of youth services and social inclusion projects in both counties, in addition to supporting many other initiatives and services - for example, music generation, school completion and outdoor education.<\/p><p>We also provide a range of services to our schools and centres in the areas of human resources, corporate services and finance.  We manage 70 buildings and premises both for ourselves and other patrons.  Our capital programme in 2015 was is in excess of &euro;14.2 million and in 2018 this has increased to &euro;15.7 million.  <\/p><p> What we do is important and it is incumbent on us to take the responsibilities we have been given very seriously to ensure quality of delivery, support and progression for all our learners and importantly, value for money through propriety in our financial matters.  It is therefore of regret that the Comptroller and Auditor General and Thorn reports which are before the committee today point to serious lapses and gaps in terms of our required regulatory, financial and propriety responsibilities.  While the reports note there were arrangements and documented procedures to manage procurement and conflicts of interest in place, their findings highlight serious concerns and shortcomings on an operative basis in the implementation of procurement and other processes during the period of the investigation.  We accept these findings. <\/p><p> I am here today as the Accounting Officer of KWETB to give account to the committee of its general administration, in particular to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General 2015 audited accounts and supplementary report, and indeed any other matters the committee may wish to raise. <\/p><p> While it is my intention to fully engage with the committee, there are a number of matters that have been referred to the National Economic Crime Bureau.  A criminal investigation of these matters is currently under way and as such, there might be topics that I and the other representatives from KWETB are not in a position to discuss.  I can confirm that we are co-operating in full with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that this investigation can reach its conclusion in as efficient and timely a manner as possible. Considerable resources and time have had to be diverted to this investigation.  Despite this, our core work has continued and I am indebted to our teachers, tutors, leaders and support staff who are committed to the service of teaching and learning in our ETB. <\/p><p> While acknowledging and accepting the seriousness of the findings of both reports, I hope that I can provide assurances to the committee that KWETB has set out to build a robust culture of corporate governance, building on the policies and controls that had previously been in place but strengthening them in areas of oversight and internal control in, but not limited to, the key areas as identified in both reports.  Our current corporate governance programme reflects the requirements of ETBs with regard to our internal practices and reporting to our board, our external oversight and reporting requirements to Government, committees of the Oireachtas, respective Departments, and the Minister, as well as other agencies and funders.  Particular attention has been paid to procurement processes and oversight, document retention and control, risk management, management of conflicts of interest, and other matters of propriety.  This programme now needs to be advanced in line with the additional requirements as set out in the new code of corporate governance for ETBs as issued in January 2019 by the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p><p> We are also working closely with the other statutory reporting and auditing authorities of the state as relevant to ETBs.  The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently conducting the 2016 audit.  The ETB internal audit unit, IAU, has concluded its ICT and youthreach audit work.  The ICT opinion report has been sent to the Department and we are currently working on the management response to the youthreach audit.  The IAU have commenced a full internal audit of KWETB's procurement processes, procedures and internal controls.  This audit is both timely and welcome.  In line with any findings and recommendations of the IAU audit work and related reports we are committed to adapting our corporate governance programme, internal controls and risk registers.<\/p><p> The corrective and immediate actions that have taken place in the light of both the Thorn and Comptroller and Auditor General reports are of particular importance.  While the final Thorn report, \"Investigation into Certain Matters in Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board\", was not issued for the attention of the board and executive of KWETB until 12 September, it was noted by Dr. Thorn that the response of KWETB had been both comprehensive and constructive in the manner in which the executive and board committed to dealing with its recommendations and findings.  On the issuing of the report, the Minister, in accordance with section 41(3) of The Education and Training Board Act 2013, gave a number of directions to the board on the performance of its functions.  The board accepted the directions in full.  In addition to these directions, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills also directed the chief executive, that is, myself, on a number of matters. Those matters related to a range of actions to which KWETB had committed as part of the recommendations made by Dr. Thorn, the expectations of the Department in terms of the delivery of these actions and the reporting and oversight arrangements that were to be put in place. <\/p><p> During the period from September to November 2018, the executive worked on its action plan for presentation and agreement of the board at its December meeting.  A final corporate governance programme was presented and approved by the board on 13 December 2018.  A full report was issued to the Department in January 2019.  An updated report has been prepared for the Committee of Public Accounts by way of a briefing paper.  A steering group comprising the chairperson, vice chairperson and members of the executive has been constituted to have oversight of this programme and to report to the board on its progress. <\/p><p> During what has been a very difficult period for KWETB, it is important to assure the committee that both the board and executive have worked hard to ensure that we continue to deliver on our legislative responsibilities.  We achieve this by delivering a quality service for all our learners; this at all times remains at the core of what we do.  All of our actions under our corporate governance programme are to ensure the best quality of experience for our learners, proper learning environments, physical spaces, adequate resources, both financial and human and ultimately value for money for the Exchequer.  We are fully committed to this and are fully mindful of the governance responsibilities that go with that. <\/p><p> As chief executive of KWETB, I wish to formally confirm my commitment to the highest standards of propriety and good practice to the learners, staff, communities of Kildare and Wicklow, Minister for Education and Skills and the members of the Committee of Public Accounts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Keyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Keyes.

We did that before the Comptroller and Auditor General's review was complete.  We will listen to the views of this committee and we might seek to update the code of governance further.  We have amended procedures on minor, small devolved projects and on big devolved building projects as a result of, among other things, the lessons we have learned in this regard.

The Department was already aware of the issues and was following up with the education and training board on the matter prior to the issue coming to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the audit.  We explained our position on the matter.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to temporary accommodation for Naas community national school.  This was a school in prefabs.  It had demographic needs.  Two additional prefabs were approved to cater for those needs.  Separately, the original, older prefabs in the school incurred some damage in storms.  Emergency approval was granted to make repairs but there were concerns among the parental group about the suitability of the full school to be in operation at that location.  A decision was made at the time to temporarily locate the school at a vacant permanent building that the Department had built in Craddockstown.  We had earmarked that as an advance building for Naas community college.  That was a temporary move.  The prefabs were provided in the original location for Naas community national school but because of parental concerns the school did not go back to the original prefabs.  Those prefabs were then vacant and the education and training board had a demographic need for two prefabs in Maynooth.  They were relocated there.<\/p> <p>  The overall context when looking at this issue is the scale and extent of demographic growth in the Kildare area at the time.  During the past decade primary enrolments in Kildare have grown by approximately 20% while post-primary enrolments have grown by close enough to 35% or 40%.  There were extraordinary demographic pressures and it was not easy to manage and cater for these at the time.  That is the context.<\/p> <p>  The question of most pertinence in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was the procurement process for the removal of the prefabs from Naas to Maynooth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#T01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1550739600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Are there any consequences for the building projects while the investigation is going on?

My final question is to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and relates to the Act, which underpins the work of the ETBs.

There were two supplementary reports, one of which related to the VECs, although there was some crossover with the issues that emerged at the Kildare and Wicklow ETB in 2015.  Dr. Thorn, who was appointed by the Department, published a report that made findings that were of considerable concern to the Department and the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was also the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and a criminal investigation, which we obviously cannot discuss.  Through all of that process, how did an individual get redeployed and why were the powers of suspension and removal never acted on?

It is important to note that there was follow-up after 2012.  There was an internal audit review of procurement in the VEC that was subsequently given to the ETB when it was established.  That was one of the reasons the ETB's internal audit service decided not to have a further procurement audit.  It had effectively just done a procurement audit.  There were management findings which would be considered by the audit committee in terms of their effective implementation.  The Department did not conclude a view on this matter until the Thorn report was completed.  That report was completed and published after the former CEO had retired.  There was no necessity for the ETB or the Department to consider, nor would it have been possible, to consider.  I do not think there was enough of an outcome.

Those are examples where the centralised internal audit unit has the capacity, because the issues were common across the ETBs, to bring that sectoral learning to ensure that what is learned in one ETB is carried across for other ETBs.  The terms of reference of the internal audit unit allow it to do specific audits of ETBs where specific issues have arisen.  To date, one of the potential challenges has been capacity, as we have spoken about.  At the moment, however, the audit committee with the five additional external auditors has nine members of staff between audit and support staff.  Even when its recruitment process has finished, it will have nine.  The challenges with capacity that were faced in the previous years will, hopefully, see an improvement following the recruitment process of the additional auditors.  Notwithstanding parts of the issues and the reason that it had to seek external support was the challenging environment of securing auditors, the internal audit unit has identified the recruitment difficulties, including the length of time it has had to advertise without getting responses.

Is it his opinion that most of our corporate governance structures until now have been box-ticking exercises?  For all the governance structures, rules and boards in place, at the end of the day we have a problem in front of us.  I take from Mr. Kelly's commentary that it would be his opinion that up to now most things have been box-ticking exercises and that he is trying to change things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#DD02500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550739600,"counter":957,"content":"<p>I would not agree with the Deputy.

The meeting will resume on the housing issue at 3.30 p.m. rather than 2.30 p.m. <\/p> <p>  I have one question.  There were various issues including the Comptroller and Auditor General being unable to complete the 2015 audit.  We had the Thorn report.  I have a simple question that this committee asks.  Has anyone quantified the loss or potential loss to the taxpayer as a result of all these issues?  It is one of the first meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts where no one has tossed out a figure for a potential loss.  Has it been quantified?  I will ask the three witnesses individually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019022100002#EE02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550739600,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>No, there are still questions open as to whether there has been loss and its quantum.

It will be so historic.  From the perspective of a Chairman of a Committee of Public Accounts, justice delayed is justice denied.  The taxpayer will be denied if there is a loss.  It has already taken six years and nobody has been able to put a figure on the loss, if there is a figure.  In another few years, we might have a figure, or we might not.  I believe there is something wrong with the whole process if, six years after an issue arises, we do not even know if there is a loss.  The witnesses can understand my position.  They do not have an answer.  I suppose they will say to me it is a rhetorical question but they get where I am coming from.  I am surprised at the position we are in if these issues were so serious as to take up so much time.  Even when Mr. Thorn was sent in, why did somebody not try to deal with this?  Why did the finance committee not check whether we were out of pocket?  If the organisation is out of pocket, it is the front-line services, including the youth services and all the other great services provided, that are affected.  If there was less money in the organisation and something else got cut, that is what we are here to know about.  Six years after some of these issues arising, people are just beginning to ask the question.  The answer is that we will wait until the Garda completes its work and look at it at that stage.

Nothing was said there that could compromise any investigation by the Garda or any case, if it arises in due course.  That was the important concern I had.  We have probably asked questions to which we have not got answers so we ask that the information sought be sent on to the committee as soon as possible.
