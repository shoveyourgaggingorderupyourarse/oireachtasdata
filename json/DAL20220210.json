It was the first international organisation the new State joined.

Ireland is committed to being among the first ILO member states to ratify convention No. 190.  To date, only ten of the 187 member states have ratified the convention and it is in force in three.  A campaign within the Government is not necessary as the Government fully supports its ratification as a matter of priority.  Ratification is being considered in the context of our standard approach to the ratification of international instruments.  Under this approach, Ireland does not ratify a convention until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.  Convention No. 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issue of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work.  Ireland already has very strong protections in law to combat violence and harassment in the workplace and has ratified the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, that is, the Istanbul Convention.  Officials in my Department are engaging with all relevant Departments and offices to establish the extent to which domestic legislative provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements included in the convention, as well what as legislative amendments, if any, may be required to enable ratification.  The Department is currently carrying out an analysis of the outcomes and engaging with legal advisers.  Officials are meeting this week to ensure there are no gaps.  Following this consideration, as part of the ratification process in the coming months the Department will undertake a stakeholder consultation with trade unions, employer bodies and other interested parties.  The views of the Attorney General will also be sought after the consultation phase, followed by the formal approval by the Government of ratification.  We anticipate that we will be able to ratify and sign the instrument by July 2022, but certainly no later than the end of the calendar year.  A formal ceremony will then take place to present the convention to the director general of the ILO in Geneva.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000003#A00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1644483600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for that update.

We went through the various mechanisms we can use to achieve the results he is seeking.  The Government is keenly aware, as we stressed during yesterday's debate, of the pressures people are feeling as the rate of inflation and the cost of living increase.  Many costs have increased sharply in recent times and those on lower incomes are being disproportionately affected.  Ministers and their officials in various Departments have been tasked with developing proposals for a package to help families and businesses with the cost of living and doing business.  The Government is finalising that package this week.<\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment in 2015, the Low Pay Commission has been responsible for making annual recommendations to the Government on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage.  Again, this was discussed yesterday.  Since then, the national minimum wage has increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022, which is a 21.4% increase.  This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the six years to December 2021, demonstrating that the minimum wage has increased in real terms over consumer price increases in recent years.  As I discussed with the Deputy yesterday, if we followed the proposals in his motion, they would possibly result in a lower minimum wage, which I do not think is an outcome he would recommend to anybody.  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, reducing from 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020.<\/p> <p> The Low Pay Commission is made up of an equal number of employer representatives, employee representatives and independent members which helps to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the national minimum wage.  In addition, the establishing legislation requires the commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate national minimum wage rate.  These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.<\/p> <p> When considering increases in the national minimum wage during a period of inflation, the Government must be conscious of the need to avoid second round effects or a wage-price spiral.  That being said, we have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on lower pay.<\/p> <p> In 2021, the Low Pay Commission was asked by the T&aacute;naiste to examine and make recommendations on the best approach to achieving the programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.  The Low Pay Commission commissioned and received background technical research on the concept of a living wage.  The commission is currently evaluating this research and is due to report its findings and recommendations to the T&aacute;naiste in the coming months.  These recommendations will inform the Government on the best approach to progressing to a living wage.  In relation to the minimum wage, they generally will report to us in July and decisions are made after that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Barry will recall that yesterday, during the debate, I discussed with him that we do not necessarily agree with his mechanism.  We did not vote against the Deputy's proposal but the mechanism he put forward is a predetermined outcome of the work that the Low Pay Commission was set up to do.  That is not necessarily the best way for the commission to go about its business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000003#A01300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644484200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The Government is ignoring a decision of the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of living package that is being reported in media this morning and watched carefully by low-paid workers involves increased electricity credit, an extension of fuel allowance and the bringing forward of the working family payment by two months.  Of course, groceries are up &euro;800 a year, petrol is up &euro;500 a year and electricity is up &euro;800 a year.  That is more than &euro;2,000 before we get to the rent.

In the UK, the Unite trade union has won cost of living increases in 25 workplaces by balloting for industrial action and by taking industrial action where necessary.  In many cases, the threat of industrial action was sufficient.  That is an example that should be followed in this country.  If workers go back and delve into the best traditions of the labour movement - the traditions of the 1960s and 1970s and the traditions of the founders of the movement, Connolly and Larkin - to fight for pay increases, we can achieve the cost of living increases that the Government seems set to deny us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000004#B00600","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1644484200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I have nothing more to add bar that the Government is responding to this.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy Barry, yesterday and again today, with his call for action.

On 22 December 2021, it was signed by the President into law.  This landmark legislation will transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, into a statutory and independent agency to be known as the corporate enforcement authority, CEA, which will have additional resources to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime.  The legislation will provide the authority with greater autonomy and flexibility to adapt to the challenges of encouraging greater compliance with and enforcement of company law.  As I said then, it is our firm intention to commence all aspects of the Act as soon as possible, once the organisational matters integral to the establishment of the authority have been finalised.<\/p>  <p>  Last Thursday, the Minister of State, Deputy English, signalled in the D&aacute;il our intention to make a simple but necessary amendment to address a cross-referencing error to a Schedule in the Act.

A clerical officer and digital forensics manager have already been assigned.  The post of director of governance and support operations will be filled shortly.  The recruitment process is also under way for the posts of director of finance and ICT and a senior enforcement lawyer.

We have a mechanism to do so in regard to the Bill the Minister of State, Deputy English, is bringing forward.  We must also ensure that the arrangement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ODCE is finalised and put on a permanent basis going forward.  Negotiations in regard to that are almost complete.  When they are completed, a memorandum of understanding will be signed by both the CEA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and at that stage it will be the right time to commence this new authority, which is something we all want to see.  I assure Deputy Quinlivan that there is no resistance on this side of the House.  We will have the authority set up and operational in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000005#C00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","time":1644484800,"counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000005#C00400"},{"type":"question","time":1644484800,"counter":38,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[6406\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000005#C00500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of business closures over the past five years; and the total value of business supports that have been provided by his Department as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.","asker":"1504","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1644484800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Over the past two years Ireland has seen the implementation of the longest and most severe restrictions anywhere in Europe.

It does depend on how you define restrictions.  Some people define it as working from home and other people define it as business closures and so on.  It is worth pointing out that Ireland is now one of the most open countries in the world.  Most European countries still have restrictions in place.  Businesses are closed and there are restrictions on opening hours.  People are not able to stand at a bar and nightclubs are closed, among other measures.  We are now one of the most open countries in Europe.  Much of south-east Asia is still pursuing a zero-Covid policy and is still in lockdown.  Restrictions were tightened in Hong Kong the other day, for example.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of business supports, it is fair to say that the Government has not been found wanting when it comes to supporting the economy and jobs, providing a robust and sustained multibillion euro package that compares well internationally.

The ability to apply countercyclical fiscal policy in this way has been made possible only by the prudent management of the public finances in the preceding years.  The official and most comprehensive data on business closures is provided by the Central Statistics Office.  The data are only available for up to 2018 because the Revenue Commissioners need two years of inactivity to count a company as closed.

I am keen to get the legislation into the House in the next couple of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Introducing statutory sick leave is part of the pandemic dividend, the more inclusive economy and fairer society we want to build.  It is one of five new workers' rights being established this year, the other four being a new public holiday; the right to request remote working and the right to flexible working; new rights around redundancy for people laid off during the pandemic; and better protection of workplace tips and gratuities.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is an outlier among developed OECD countries in not providing for any statutory paid sick leave.  I do not think it is right that people feel forced to go to work when they are sick and it is certainly not good for public health.  The Bill is intended to provide a level of protection for low-paid employees who may have no company sick pay schemes and, therefore, cannot afford to miss work.  As a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit from the State kicks in.  This is a progressive Bill and will ensure all employees are better off and will have financial protection from day one of a medically certified absence.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the current economic climate, the initial period covered by employers will be modest but will increase incrementally.  We must be mindful of imposing excessive costs on employers, particularly small businesses, many of whom have had a very difficult two years with Covid and Brexit.  That is why we are taking an incremental approach to introducing the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation will provide for sick pay of 70% of gross salary up to a cap of &euro;110 for three working days in a calendar year, and will eventually go to ten days.  I believe it would be unreasonable to introduce a legal obligation for employers to pay for sick leave without the need for a worker to produce evidence for this in the form of a medical certificate.  That would not be sick leave; it would be a different form of leave.  The requirement for a medical certificate for paid sick leave is a fair and necessary provision.  It is also not an unusual requirement.  Employees are currently required to provide medical certificates to access the State illness benefit scheme and it is a requirement in many sectoral and company level sick pay arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the committee for its work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report.

What I am trying to put into the T&aacute;naiste's head and what I am asking him to consider is the case of a worker who cannot access this.  They might have &euro;55 or &euro;60 in their pocket but that could be the money they have to do them for the rest of the week.  In a situation where a worker does not have the necessary funds to be able to go to the GP, that worker is left in a quandary, as I am sure the T&aacute;naiste can see.

There will be employers who will not require a sick certificate for the first day or may only require it for the second or third day.  However, to actually require an employer in law to give somebody paid sick leave without any evidence would not be right or fair and it would change it from being sick leave to being a different form of leave.  I just do not think that would be the right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  The solution to this is through the GMS medical card system.  At the moment, about 40% of people in the country either have a medical card or a doctor visit card, so those on the lowest incomes currently do not have to pay to see their doctor.  I appreciate there are people on low pay who do not qualify for a medical card or a doctor visit card, and the Deputy and I encounter them all of the time in our work as constituency Deputies.

In the absence of access to GP care without cost, or without a cost to the individual going there, it is unfair to put that in place.  In the countries the T&aacute;naiste is referring to where certification is required on the first day as part of a statutory sick pay scheme, those workers have access to a GP that they do not have to fund out of their own pockets.  That is where the problem is.  It could be that a short-term solution is required while we await the establishment of a GP service that is free at the point of delivery.  We are not there yet and we are not nearly there, so the fact is there will be workers who have to make that decision.

The scope of the national claims information database has been widened so that we have the key information on employer and public liability and a fraud unit has also been established in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I acknowledge the work that is being carried out locally through the involvement of the local authorities, the LEOs and all involved in running enterprise centres, digital hubs and so on.  They can work extremely well and the Government is keen to target investment and to match taxpayer's money with private money, local authority funds and other funding to get the full benefit of these centres.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise centres provide important infrastructure for entrepreneurs and are an essential part of the start-up ecosystem across Ireland.  The centres, many of which are regionally based, provide space, mentoring and support to start-up founders and teams, helping them to scale internationally.  They assist companies with growth strategies when businesses want to expand and move out of the back yard, the house or the small office.<\/p>  <p>  To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;250 million administered by Enterprise Ireland to support the establishment of 270 enterprise centres throughout Ireland, of which approximately 40 originated from the regional enterprise plans.  This investment has enabled the establishment of physical space for entrepreneurs, start-ups, scaling companies, SMEs and a balance of small scale foreign direct investment, FDI.  This has enabled the delivery of enterprise relevant programmes to companies and the provision of physical spaces to support remote working.  Again, the conversation we had in Cavan and Monaghan was around the need for more physical space and proper work solutions.  That is something we want to work on through the regional enterprise plans and the funds have been confirmed for that.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, Enterprise Ireland has administered departmental funding to 91 projects totalling &euro;16.4 million under both the regional enterprise development fund and the community enterprise centres schemes.  On 20 November 2020, &euro;8.24 million in grants, administered through Enterprise Ireland, for 95 enterprise centres around the country was announced.  This funding will ensure that these enterprise centres, many of which have been negatively impacted by Covid-19, can sustain their businesses, pivot and further develop their services to continue to assist the development of our start-up companies.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, an Enterprise Ireland open regional development feasibility fund is available to promoters seeking to scope out and investigate the viability of larger full-scale projects such as remote working hubs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000008#F00800","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1644486600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Since then, there has been a steady and sizeable increase in the share of women on the largest listed company boards, from a very low figure of 18% in 2018 to 31% in September 2021.  This is a significant achievement in a short space of time.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for the work she and others have put into the Irish Corporate Governance (Gender Balance) Bill 2021.

Still, I accept that voluntary targets might not be working quickly enough and do not deal with companies that are not engaging at all.  There are still several companies which have no women members on their boards at all.  Each year gender balance is not achieved is a year too many.  Therefore, I welcome the legislation that the Deputy put forward.

However, that does not deal with the hold-outs that still have all-male boards or maybe just one or two women on their boards.  I have no doubt we will get better decisions made in organisations that have proper balance and diversity on their boards.

It is better for governance, risk and for the whole decision-making process.  McKinsey did a report on this in 2020.

That then takes a couple of months and decisions will probably be made around April or May at the latest.  In a few weeks we will open the consultation and see where it goes after that.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Deputy the background to that as well.  The occupations lists for employment permits are subject to twice-yearly reviews to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements.  The next occupational lists review will, as I said, open in the next couple of weeks and submissions will be invited through a public consultation to be launched on our Department&rsquo;s website.  The issue the Deputy raised has been discussed quite a lot here.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and myself are happy to engage on this area and to try to work with this sector to see how we can resolve this.  Permits are not the only solution.  There are others as well.  However, it is something we will look at again, as we did in the last two rounds as well.<\/p>  <p>  My Department chairs the economic migration interdepartmental group with membership drawn from senior officials of key Departments and offices, including the Department of Social Protection.  In this case, the relevant Department is the Department of Health.  The aim of the group is to promote an integrated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages being experienced in the economy.  This includes assessing proposals received through the public consultation for changes to the occupations lists.  The Department of Social Protection plays a role in the review process through its provision of advice on the uptake of its tailored employment services by employers.  In order to change the status of an occupation on the lists, there must be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA, and not to other factors such as salary, employment conditions, or both.<\/p>  <p>  The contracts of employment and employment terms and conditions being offered to home care workers are significant factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage.  For example, issues such as failure to guarantee hours of work and the lack of travel and subsistence payments are factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector.  Thus, as we review the sector an issue seems to be coming through.  When you see a high number of part-time workers that is something we need to get in behind and interrogate a little more.  I am conscious there are many in that sector who might choose to be part-time workers but it is something we need to tease out much more with the sector and the Departments of Health and Social Protection.  We are willing to do that but to be very clear, the sector has been asked to engage much more with the Department of Social Protection to try to flesh this out as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000010#H00800","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1644487800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

I thank him also for the clarity on highlighting that it is not just a shortage or workers, which it is, because nationwide there are 5,322 people approved for home support but with no carer available.  In Galway there are 278 persons on a waiting list and in the region, that is the community healthcare organisation, CHO2 region, there are 698 persons on a waiting list.  Clearly, we have a problem of not enough carers.  It is very significant the Minister of State has highlighted that it is not just a shortage but that the reason for same is the bad conditions.  Part-time work suits an awful lot of people but it cannot be precarious.  Thus, we have a significant problem here.

To be very clear, the evidence gathered around this, which is in conjunction with the expert group on future skills needs, labour market research and SOLAS, is that it is in specific areas, in this case that of the Department of Health in addition to the Department of Social Protection.  The sector has not been able to provide the evidence to show it cannot reach the staff requirements it needs within the EEA.  The difficulty and the questions are around the quite high number of people who are part-time, which is 75%.  I have already acknowledged there could be some reasons for that because it suits some people in that sector.  However, there are also the issues around contracts of employment, travel and subsistence and other matters that must be teased out.  The evidence was not there to back up a need to allow permits for the sector.  We reviewed the evidence for healthcare assistants in nursing homes and made changes last April, I think.

I am acutely aware of the impact of rising input costs on farmers, family farms and businesses, as highlighted in the Deputies' questions.  The very significant rise in fertiliser prices in the past year, particularly in recent months, is concerning.  There are a number of factors at play in the market, including energy prices remaining well above January 2021 levels.  Increased global demand, especially from the big grain-producing countries, controls of fertiliser exports from large fertiliser producing countries, increased transport costs and EU-imposed tariffs and duties on certain third country imports are all impacting prices here for our farmers.<\/p>  <p>  I have been following the rising fertiliser price issue closely for the past number of months.  In October 2021, I tasked Teagasc to lay out a credible roadmap to assist farmers in the short term as well as offering a long-term solution in the move to reduce dependency on chemical fertiliser.  I launched the soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign at Teagasc in Ballyhaise on 26 January last.  This is a strategy that can ease the price pressure on farmers and will be good for the environment and for farmers' pockets, particularly in seeking to address the challenge of increased fertiliser prices.<\/p>  <p>  I have also raised the issues highlighted by the Deputes a number of times at European Council level.  At the November Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I again raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs.  I called on the EU Commission to consider seriously all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including the question of whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate and for this matter to be examined and addressed as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  Following the November meeting, I wrote to the EU Commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, requesting that the Commission's assessment of the ongoing appropriateness of anti-dumping duties on fertilisers be completed as soon as possible.  The EU Commission responded on 26 January that it is still collecting information to establish the relevant facts.  In the meantime, Teagasc will continue to work with farmers through the soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign to help farmers to adapt to the current fertiliser market and support them to make informed decisions on what is best for their farms.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisers -  a compendium of 20 fact sheets -  to optimise the use of plant nutrients and to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability.  In addition, a new &euro;1 million initiative by my Department will support the planting of multi-species swards to reduce dependence on fertiliser this year and in future years.  A pilot soil sampling programme was introduced at the end of last year, which will provide farmers with comprehensive details of soil health and soil condition on their farms.  I hope, as a result of that, to apply an appropriate level of fertiliser or organic manure to reflect the needs of the soil and to maximise growth.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies can appreciate, Ireland is a relatively small market in respect of fertiliser sales and their usage compared with many of our EU neighbours.  As a result, Irish fertiliser companies are price-takers that are dependent on global fertiliser supply and demand.  It is to be hoped we may see a levelling off at least of some of these contributing rising price factors this year.  This is not to diminish the pressures being faced by our farmers today.  The initiatives I have introduced should support farmers reduce their dependence on fertiliser.  I assure this House that both I and my Department will continue to monitor the situation closely.  I am examining all options to ease the burden on farmers in the short and long term.  There is no doubt this is the real challenge facing farm families this year.  I am very much of aware of that and I know the Deputies are keen to ensure it is central to our thinking at the start of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000012#K01200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1644489000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>There is nothing in what the Minister said that will allow me or any other Deputy to convince the farmers that have been in touch with us that the Government understands the challenges they are facing and that it is taking action to resolve them.

Letters to the European Commission are well and good and are important in regard to fertiliser costs, but my question dealt with much broader issues in terms of input costs that are facing our farming families.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on one specific issue.  Many of the challenges farmers are facing can be directly attributed to Brexit and the impact it has had.  Will the Minister ensure the Brexit adjustment reserve is utilised to provide direct support to farming families to meet the rising input costs?  To date, the only people in the agrifood sector who have got a cent of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund are processors.

It is frequently used by the Department and in the industry to describe its opposite.  The term needs to mean practices that can be maintained using natural approaches that use the strength of our soil and climate rather than leaving farmers reliant on chemical imports.  Our soil fertility is an incredible natural asset that needs to be respected and managed correctly.  The Department must start ensuring nutrient management through the use of organic practices and we desperately need greater knowledge transfer in this area.  The soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign the Minister talked about is a welcome development but we need additional measures to foster far greater sustainable soil management practices.

I am very much aware of this emerging issue and continue to monitor it closely.<\/p>  <p>  There are few farms in the country without the capacity to be more efficient in the use of organic nutrients and more than ever this year, it will be important we do that.  As Deputy Cairns said, in the medium and long term, this will cause us to take stock of how we can further reduce our dependence on chemical fertiliser while keeping up productivity.  We must focus on soil fertility and multi-species sward, in which there is tremendous potential.  That does not take away from the immediate challenge and while I am supporting further take-up of multi-species sward this year and further attention being paid to soil fertility, there is an immediate challenge around the crisis.

That increases virtually all of the input costs for farmers.  People might think farmers are exempt from the carbon tax in terms of their own fuel but the truth is that many farmers use farm contractors to carry out work on their farms and they are not exempt.

Farmers, as we know, are some of the most innovative people.  The Department needs to look at ways of embedding methods and efficiencies which are coming out of the rising costs of fertiliser.  Slurry and farmyard manure can be used in low phosphorous and potassium index areas.  There are other options, such as grazing management and multi-species swards, which the Minister talked about.  We also know it is long proven that cover crops of clover fix more nitrogen than those chemical imports on which farmers are spending so much money.

This is done in the interests of protecting the landowner.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Project Woodland was established in February 2021 to ensure that the current licensing backlog is addressed and that a new impetus is brought to woodland creation in Ireland.  A national shared vision for the future of Ireland's trees and forests and a new forestry strategy are currently being developed.  That will guide how we deal with the afforestation issue over the years and decades ahead.  The new forest strategy will underpin a new forestry programme for the period 2023 to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  An extensive public consultation process on the new strategy has commenced and stakeholders will have an opportunity to raise any issues they feel need to be addressed with my Department.  Work on the next forestry programme will include a review of grant rates and my Department will examine current forestry operational costs during that process.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department is introducing an enhanced payment for applicants and forestry companies to acknowledge the additional cost of submitting the various environmental reports where required.  This will be delivered through a higher payment at form 2 stage, which is the payment made when planting is complete.  In addition, we will also examine a feasibility study into various grant payment approaches.<\/p>  <p>  A licensing strategy for 2022 has just been published which has set ambitious targets this year of increasing licensing output by 30% and more than doubling the afforestation target by increasing it by 107%.  This builds on the gains made in improved licensing last year which was 56% higher than the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  It will be an important confidence booster for all with an interest in seeing more trees planted in Ireland and I firmly believe it must be matched by a renewed effort by all to promote the benefits of afforestation to farmers and landowners. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000013#L01900","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1644489600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her answer.

The impact of the loss of access to these waters on the Irish fishing vessels that have traditionally fished for squid and haddock in the waters around Rockall was examined by the task force.  To clarify the figures I provided to the House in response to a previous question on this issue, the task force estimated that, in 2019, the total squid fishery was valued at approximately &euro;6.6 million.  The majority of squid is taken from the waters surrounding Rockall and this amounted to 1,071 tonnes valued at in excess of &euro;5 million in 2019, and 371 tonnes valued at &euro;1.6 million in 2020.   The estimate by the task force of the catch of other stocks near Rockall is &euro;1 million.<\/p>  <p>  I launched a Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme in September 2021 on foot of the task force recommendation.  The scheme was established as a targeted measure for certain segments of the fishing fleet to mitigate the loss of income in 2021 arising from the significant quota reductions under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  In line with the task force recommendations, I extended that scheme for an additional month to cover vessels that could not participate in the Rockall squid fishery.  The scheme was administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, Ireland has never made any claims to Rockall, nor have we ever recognised British sovereignty claims over it.

Through this engagement, the Government is seeking to address the issues involved, reflecting the long-standing fisheries traditions in the area.  Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I continue to consider all options for further engagement and are working in every way we can to secure a satisfactory resolution this year.

At the outset, it should be noted that Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments are governed by EU regulations and are subject to rigorous audit and control by the European Commission.  That is a central aspect of this issue.  The basic payment scheme application process has been streamlined over many years to ensure as quick, efficient and responsive a process as possible and, most importantly, prompt payment for farmers.  The application process is reviewed annually to make it as clear and straightforward as possible.<\/p> <p>Every effort is being made by the Department to improve the quality of applications, with the aim of lowering reductions and administrative penalties, as well as allowing errors to be resolved and payments to be issued in good time.  The basic payment system, which is an online application system, usually opens for applications in mid-February and it closes mid-May.  The system provides a step-by-step process with warnings to ensure the application is submitted, as much as is possible, free of errors.  Farmers can correct errors on their applications online up until the end of May without penalty.  Late amendments are also accepted online up to mid-June with a penalty.  Farmers are permitted to correct obvious and innocent errors at any time after the end of May.  However, it should be noted that amendments are not possible if the farmer has already been informed of irregularities in their application or has been given notice of an upcoming on-the-spot inspection, or if an on-the-spot inspection reveals irregularities in their application.  A further process, known as preliminary checks, alerts applicants to errors on land issues such as overclaims, overlaps and dual claims.  These preliminary checks allow applicants to amend certain errors quickly, thereby avoiding penalties.<\/p> <p> Applicants are requested to tick a box to confirm if they wish to apply for the ANC scheme each year.  It is a requirement that the applicant must make a declaration that they are applying for this scheme and will comply with the terms and conditions.  If an applicant does not tick the box to apply for ANC initially, and if they received payment under this scheme in the previous scheme year, they are presented with an additional pop-up warning under the heading, &ldquo;Do you wish to apply for ANC?&rdquo;.  This warning advises that they had received a payment in previous years and requests them to select from one of two options, \"I want to apply for ANC\" or \"I do not want to apply for ANC\".  The warnings and reminders are to ensure applicants are fully aware of the schemes they are or are not applying for.  I will supply a further answer in next my response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000015#N02500","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644491400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive response.  What is missing here is that some farmers, including some in my own constituency, are not very computer-literate or experienced.

We need flexibility within the Department and from the officials to try to ensure as many farmers as possible who are entitled to their grants and entitlements will get them.  We should not say, \"we will give it to you if you are correct and if you are not, goodbye to you\".  Some farmers are trying to appeal these issues, which, again, is cumbersome.  I know a farmer who made a mistake but was afraid to tell anybody about it.  He went without the entitlements until his accountants saw it on his accounts.

In order to address the delays which had arisen due to these changed circumstances, the Department invested heavily in additional resources and in process improvements to increase licence output.  This has had the desired effect, with a marked increase in the number of licences issued last year, at 4,050 forestry licences.

Through the on-farm investment scheme, TAMS, we have seen just under &euro;100 million invested in low emissions slurry spreading machines and equipment.  There are now approximately 3,500 low emissions slurry spreading machines in the country, from a base of none between five and seven years ago.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the national ammonia emissions come from the agricultural sector, and a significant volume from slurry.  The old splash-plate technology where slurry hits the plate and then sprays up in the air before it hits the ground increases ammonia emissions and it increases the loss to the atmosphere.  It also leads to less of the organic material going into the ground and growing grass.  What low emissions slurry spreading does, either through dribbling or a trailing shoe system, is leave slurry along the ground.  The machinery is much more expensive.  Machines can cost up to &euro;40,000 but there is a tremendous number of them now.  We have seen a significant uptake.  It is a requirement now for all farmers in nitrates derogation to spread slurry using low emissions slurry spreading equipment.  So far, it has resulted in a reduction of 7% in our national ammonia emissions.  We are going to step this up a lot more significantly in the time ahead.  It has great potential.  It is a win-win.<\/p> <p>The capital investment is more expensive but we are putting the grant aid into that to support farmers.  Ultimately, it pay offs in the utilisation of nitrogen and other ingredients in the slurry to grow grass and get it into the ground, where we want it to be.  It needs to be spread at a rate that is most efficient so the grass grows while minimising in every way possible the impact on the environment around us.

Speaking to the issue we discussed earlier on Priority Questions regarding the cost of chemical fertilisers this year, farmers are increasingly going to be looking to the potential to efficiently use organic fertiliser and maximise its potential as a growth nutrient through further adoption over the course of the year of low emissions slurry spreading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000020#S00500","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","time":1644493800,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000020#S00550"},{"type":"question","time":1644493800,"counter":273,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[7052\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000020#S00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that the future of the dairy sector remains secure and capable of creating and generating employment in the future to the extent needed notwithstanding CAP reform or other issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1644493800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The question relates to the extent to which the Minister recognises the future of the dairy sector and its major role in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000020#S00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1644493800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>The dairy sector is a tremendously exciting one and a real driver of our agrifood industry and sector, and we have seen that develop further since the removal of quotas in 2015.  We have seen significant growth in milk output and what that means in terms of employment in all parts of the country through processing, through added value and through the increase in our national exports, which have grown from approximately &euro;8 billion in 2010 to &euro;14 billion today.  In the years up to 2030, the plan under Food Vision is to increase that &euro;14 billion to &euro;21 billion, and the dairy industry will be central to that.  We need to continue to add value and to develop it.<\/p>  <p>  A critical point is that we have to do it in a way that is sustainable and that manages and lowers emissions.  Last week, I brought together and established the dairy committee under the Food Vision 2030 strategy.  One of the first tasks I have provided it is to follow through on one of the commitments all stakeholders committed to in the strategy, which was to consider how we can efficiently manage the footprint of the dairy sector and ensure it stabilises, and then see that footprint reduce.  In doing so, it will be about adding value while also ensuring that, in the years ahead, we can make sure new entrants can go into dairying and that those who need to become larger have the capacity to do so and be economically viable.  However, we have to manage this in a way that ensures emissions do not go up.  If emissions go up, it will challenge the sector overall and diminish the value of what we are producing.  That is not the cycle we want.  We want to be in a cycle where value is being enhanced and, ultimately, where farm profitability is improving all of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000020#S00800","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1644493800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>That is a very welcome assessment of the future.

Overall, between now and 2030, while the economy is going to have to deliver, and our commitment as a Government is to drive on and deliver, a 51% economy-wide reduction in emissions by 2030, the agricultural target will be between 22% and 30%.

What has the Government done?  It has talked about it a lot in recent weeks but it appears that it is about to announce a package of measures that will only scratch the surface.  People are telling me the Government simply does not get it and that it does not understand the challenges facing ordinary workers and families.  If the Government needed an example of that, it is this.  A Minister of State went on national radio telling people to stop complaining, while behind closed doors the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the leader of the Green Party and their Cabinet colleagues signed off on an &euro;86,000 increase for a senior public servant who is now on a salary of nearly &euro;300,000 per year.  The Government announced an electricity credit of &euro;100 last year that still has not been delivered and will not be delivered for weeks to come.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste not to try to repackage that as some new initiative today.  People need support now and they have already been waiting four months for that &euro;100.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure if the T&aacute;naiste had the opportunity to listen to May on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.  May is from County Wexford and she wears a dressing gown over her clothes and drinks hot tea to stay warm because she cannot afford her heating bills.  Maybe he listened to Hugh from Leitrim, who has had to cut back on food because of the rise in prices.  There are thousands of people like Hugh and May.  Rising prices effect everybody but it does not impact everybody equally.  Low and middle income households spend more on heating their homes, on feeding their families and on rent than those at the top do and they do so with less money.  This morning, the Society St. Vincent de Paul found that two in five people have cut back on essential heating and electricity.<\/p>  <p>  Workers and families need targeted support now and they need a Government that is willing to act and listen now.  We need a direct cost of living cash payment, as Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed, of &euro;200 for individuals on incomes of &euro;30,000 or less and &euro;100 for individuals on incomes between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000.  This would provide households with direct support of more than &euro;500 in response to the cost of living crisis.  We need to get money into people&rsquo;s hands now.  For some, they will use it to pay their gas and electricity bills and for others it will be a fill of oil or ensuring they have enough diesel in their cars so they can get to work.<\/p>  <p>  It is time to wake up to the reality and it is time for the T&aacute;naiste and his Government colleagues to understand where ordinary people are.  Will the Government bring forward a targeted cost of living cash payment as we have proposed?  Will the Government put one month of rent back into renter&rsquo;s pockets and ban rent increases for the next three years?  For God&rsquo;s sake, will the Government stop the increase in oil and gas prices which it plans to implement in the month of May by heaping additional carbon taxes on people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000021#T00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1644494400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I acknowledge again on behalf of the Government that we know the cost of living is rising and inflation is running at about 5%.  As far back as last March, before the Deputy and his party were doing so, I was signalling concerns about the fact a period of inflation was likely to arise, and that is happening now.  As far back as last June I was advocating for a tax, welfare and pensions package in the budget, which others, including the Deputy's party, opposed at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The Government acknowledges the cost of living is rising, that it is biting people and that it is hurting people in the pocket.  It is hurting family budgets, a lot of people are squeezed and some people are having to make hard decisions about what they spend their money on, whether it is energy, fuel or groceries.  We see it all around us.  It is what the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents are saying to him and what my constituents are saying to me.  The cost of filling a tank with petrol or diesel has gone up dramatically and people are shocked when they see their electricity or gas bills.  Energy prices impact transport prices and so the cost of groceries is rising too.<\/p>  <p>  The Government gets and understands that and that is why we have been acting to try to cushion the blow.  In the budget, and these measures only came into effect in recent weeks, we had a &euro;1 billion cost of living package, with increases in pensions and welfare and reductions in personal income taxation.  That cost of living package worth &euro;1 billion that was announced in the budget only came into effect in recent weeks and it was opposed by the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  We will add to that today through an additional package to help people with the cost of living.  There will be a broad measure that will help every household, because even households on middle incomes are suffering from rising costs, in energy bills in particular, and there will be targeted measures that will help those who are suffering the most, particularly older people and people on low incomes or on welfare.  The budget package and the package we will announce today will be worth somewhere in the region of &euro;1.4 billion to &euro;1.5 billion, which is considerable.  That is a lot of money the Government is saying it needs to give back to people to help them with the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  I know as well as the Deputy does that, no matter what we announce today, it will not be enough.  The Sinn F&eacute;in press release is already written: inadequate; not enough.  I could write it for them.  In fact, it was probably written days ago.  Promises are cheap and easy, and more and more the public is seeing through the party.  They see what it is not doing in Northern Ireland to help people with the cost of living and they know that promises are cheap.  It is so easy for any Opposition party to say it will do twice whatever the Government will do, but people see through that and they know it is not honest.  We have had a very significant cost of living package in the budget which kicked in during January.  We will add to that through our announcements today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000021#T00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1644494400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>With all the recent talk from Ministers, including the T&aacute;naiste, it is clear from that response that they simply do not get it.

In my county there was a 24% increase and throughout the State there was an average 10% increase.  The Government does not understand the impact this is having on those on low and middle incomes.  The T&aacute;naiste talks about a package in the region of &euro;400 million, but that will not scratch the surface of what needs to happen.<\/p>  <p>  We have put forward proposal after proposal to the Government.  Do not increase the price of oil and gas in May, which it plans to do by increasing the carbon tax.  Put a month's rent back into renters' pockets by introducing a tax credit.  The Government has refused to do that.  We are blue in the face talking to it about this measure for the past three years.<\/p> <p>We are telling the Government that what is needed is cash, directly into the pockets of hard-pressed workers and families.  That can be done through a cost of living cash payment of &euro;200 for all those earning below &euro;30,000 and &euro;100 for those earning below &euro;60,000.

The package that is emerging is around &euro;450 million, which is a drop in the ocean compared with what ordinary families are having to grapple with.  The official Government advice from Ministers is to shop around for better value but those suffering under record rent prices cannot shop around; they need a rent freeze.  Those looking at soaring energy bills that are up by 30% cannot shop around for better deals; they need real intervention.  Those in low paid work cannot shop around; they need a pay rise.  Those forced to commute back to the office cannot shop around; they need the right to flexible work.  Those wondering how they will feed their families know that shopping around will not help when bread, milk and butter are all rising in price, having gone up by between 10% and 15% over recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  What we know about the Government's cost of living package is that it will not go far enough, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform admitted as much this morning.  The Government has already committed to a &euro;100 rebate on electricity bills at a cost of &euro;210 million.  If that it is doubled, it will bring it to &euro;420 million.  By our calculations, an extra two week's of fuel allowance would cost &euro;21 million, but the Government has not widened eligibility.  Figures provided to my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, show that more than 20,000 people who applied for the fuel allowance last year were refused.  Already this year, of more than 7,000 applications received, more than 3,000 were rejected.  In the budget, we called for eligibility to be extended to an extra 100,000 households, but once again, the Government's response is too little and too late.<\/p>  <p>  Bringing forward the working family payment increase by three months will cost around &euro;6 million to &euro;9 million and benefit over 50,000 families.  However, for the hundreds of thousands of families struggling with the cost of childcare, education and healthcare, there is nothing of substance emerging.  Instead of investing in public services, this Government is interested in tax cuts, in throwing &euro;600 million at people who do not need it.  The VAT windfall was &euro;1 billion ahead of projections.  In January alone, the VAT take was &euro;400 million ahead of what was collected in January 2020.  We have the opportunity and this is about choice.  There has been no shortage of solutions put forward to ease the burden on workers and families. <\/p>  <p>  It is time the Government shopped around for some new ideas.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to an immediate increase in the minimum wage?  Will he admit the budget last October got it wrong?  Will he now commit to a real mini-budget that will do more than tinker at the edges and provide real relief to workers and families?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000022#U01500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1644495000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I acknowledge again the seriousness of this issue, the fact the cost of living is rising and rising fast, that many families are feeling the pinch and that the Government needs to act.  As I said in my response earlier, the Government has already acted but we will need to do more.  The budget, which was passed in October and which only came into effect a few weeks ago, included a cost of living package worth more than &euro;1 billion.  That included increases in pensions and welfare and reductions in personal taxation for middle-income earners.  People earning &euro;38,000, &euro;45,000 or &euro;50,000 per year were the main beneficiaries of that in cash and percentage terms.  While the Labour Party may think that people earning around &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 are not feeling the pinch, I think it is wrong.  We stand over the fact we reduced personal taxes for people on middle incomes.  That was capped once people hit the higher income levels.<\/p>  <p>  What else was in the budget?  There was an increase in pensions across the board, increases in weekly welfare payments and targeted increases in payments.  The living alone allowance was increased and for people on welfare with a dependent child, the child dependent allowance was increased.  The fuel allowance eligibility was widened in the previous budget, only a few months ago.  While many people would have received an increase of only &euro;5 per week, those living alone and those with dependent children received increases of around &euro;14 per week, which is obviously a much larger figure than &euro;5.  There have also been increases in pay.  A public sector pay deal has been agreed, providing for pay increases, albeit modest ones, this February and October.  The national minimum wage went up just five weeks ago.  We have brought in a freeze on childcare fees which has been welcomed by the vast majority of families, given the high cost of childcare.  We have also reduced the cost of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  A &euro;1 billion cost of living package was announced in the budget in October, legislated for in November and December, opposed by the Opposition parties and it came into effect only a few weeks ago.  We acknowledge that because inflation is higher than we anticipated it would be, we now have to do more, and that is what we will do today.  We will announce additional measures to reduce the cost of living for people, particularly the cost of energy, but also putting more money into the pockets of those who need that money the most.<\/p>  <p>  I also need to acknowledge, and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in should acknowledge it too, that no matter what we announce, he will say it is not enough.  He does not even know what we are going to announce and he has already said it is not enough.  The press release is already written, the lines have already been sent out to his party's Deputies, Senators and councillors.  No matter what the Government does, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is going to say it is not enough because promises are cheap when you are in opposition and you do not have to make decisions.  Promises are cheap but they are not honest.

The advantage of pay increases and reducing personal taxation is that you can help everyone.  That is why we stand over that decision.<\/p>  <p> I agree on childcare.

Just like we had a housing emergency, which he finally and reluctantly had to accept existed, he needs to accept this is an emergency.  Working people, pensioners and the least well-off are being absolutely crucified by the stratospheric increase in the cost of accommodation, rents, energy prices and now all sorts of other rising costs of living.  What absolutely infuriates me is that the Government pretends as if this is like the weather, that it is not really to do with it, that it has something to do with international pressures, that it is not the Government's responsibility, and there is nothing it can really do about it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to inject something that has not been said in this debate, namely, that there are winners in all of this, and that is what needs to be addressed.  Inflation should actually be renamed price gouging and profiteering.  The reason rents go up is because landlords increase rents to unaffordable levels.  The reason energy prices go up is because energy supply companies increase the cost of that energy and they are making a lot of money out of it.  The heating misery and the housing misery that ordinary people are suffering is benefiting certain groups of people, particularly corporate interests.  Globally, BP and Shell have seen their profits jump to &euro;40 billion last year.  Shell's profits have quadrupled in one year.  In one year they have gone up by 400%.  But that is not just an international phenomenon; it is happening here.  The ESB has seen its profits jump.  In 2020, it made &euro;616 million profit, and for just one half of the year last year, it made &euro;356 million, so it is set to exceed &euro;700 million.  Energia has seen its profits jump by 46% last year, 45% the year before and it is paying dividends to its shareholders of &euro;30 million.  There are winners and there are losers.<\/p>  <p>  The same happens with rents.  Rents in this country have gone up by 61% in the last decade.  Rents in the rest of Europe have gone up too, but only by 14%.  The Government is allowing the landlords to cream it on the back of the housing misery of ordinary working people.  That is the reality, and that is never spoken about.  The rental income of IRES REIT, the biggest landlord in this country, increased to &euro;24.7 million last year.  It increased by 6% up to &euro;30 million.  While rents are stratospheric and are completely unaffordable for working people - &euro;2,000 on average in Dublin; &euro;1,500 on average for a one-bedroom apartment; &euro;2,200 for a two-bedroom apartment in my area - these people are creaming it, and the Government allows it to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has no problem with their profits going through the roof, but when workers say they would like their minimum wage increased, the Government has a big problem with that.  It argues it cannot put it to &euro;12.90 or &euro;15, as we proposed in the D&aacute;il this week.  It cannot do that but it has no problem with the REIT's profits going through the roof.<\/p>  <p>  Why does the Government not change its priorities away from protecting the profiteering of energy companies and landlords to supporting an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000023#V00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1644495600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

It is a statement of fact.  It is also a statement of fact what I said earlier but the Deputy is not willing to accept those facts.  In 2016, the Labour Party and Fine Gael together established the Low Pay Commission.  Since then the national minimum wage has increased by 26%.  Inflation has increased by 7%.  While the Deputy is talking and speechifying and demanding increases in the national minimum wage, we have actually done it.  We have increased the minimum wage ahead of inflation since 2016.  I appreciate we do not know what inflation will be like for this year and that that may not turn out to be the case.  That is why we need to take other actions.  However, the facts are that, since the Low Pay Commission was established in 2016, the minimum wage has gone up 26% and the cost of living has gone up by 7%.  That is a real increase in real terms.  We have the second highest minimum wage in the developed world.  When you adjust for the higher cost of living in Ireland, it is the sixth highest.  Median wages in Ireland are 36% higher than the European average despite claims by some that the opposite is the case.<\/p>  <p>  Once again, I emphasise that the issue of rising costs and the costs of living is very much on the mind of everyone in the Government.  There is a competition in this House, sometimes led by the Opposition but sometimes by Deputies of all parties, to make out that X person understands things more than Y person.  That is nonsense.  We are all elected by our communities.  We all have constituents, constituency clinics and offices, and the exact same people are saying the same to the Deputy that they are saying to me - that they have noticed a huge increase in the cost of filling the car with petrol or diesel, that they are shocked when they see their gas or electricity bill, that they are noticing prices rising in the supermarket - and they are worried that it will keep rising.  That is the biggest worry in many ways, that prices will continue to rise.  That is why we had a &euro;1 billion cost of living package in the budget which only kicked in in January and why we will make further decisions today to help all households with their energy bills as well as some targeted measures for those on the lowest incomes who need that help the most.  So while the Deputy is speaking and preaching, we are actually taking action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000023#V01300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1644495600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>The minimum wage in this country gives people just over &euro;400 a week.

My questions will be focused on the situation in Ukraine and more specifically how it relates to the situation in Ireland.  I think every Deputy will recall the dying days of the Celtic tiger, when our financial regulators were utterly clueless about the risks emerging on the horizon and provided absolutely no early warning whatsoever.  Even as the storm was breaking our financial regulators were oblivious to the risk.  They were telling us there was nothing to see here and that everything was fine.  However, in the end, there was something to see.  Every Deputy knows we have been living with the legacy of that disaster every day since then.<\/p>  <p>  There is also something to see in Ukraine at the moment.  The consensus assessment is there is an 80% likelihood of hostilities breaking out before the end of the month, once the Chinese Olympics finish on 20 February.  While we wish the diplomats well and are hoping for a diplomatic outcome, we should always bear in mind that the Japanese used bogus negotiations right up to the day of the Pearl Harbor attack in the 1940s.  It was the same story with the Germans before their invasion of Poland.  There is, therefore, a risk that these negotiations are not being conducted in good faith and we should be prepared accordingly.  I fully accept, as I think all Deputies do, that we have very little control of geopolitical events.  When the tectonic plates start moving, we have very little control.  However, we have much more control over how we respond and how we prepare.<\/p>  <p>  I would be grateful if the T&aacute;naiste would update the House on the continuous planning that has been taking place at Government level.  I ask that he specifically focus on whether any financial provision has been made to assist our fellow EU countries that border Ukraine in the event of a major humanitarian crisis breaking out.  Do we have any spare capacity in our refugee system to accept new refugees?  From a cybersecurity point of view, have we hardened or ruggedised our critical national infrastructure such as the national grid, the health service and the public transport system?  If they go down, the poorest people will suffer the most.  How does the T&aacute;naiste assess the safety of our embassy staff in Kyiv?  Do we have any measures in place to safeguard our energy security if things go wrong and conflict breaks out?  Energy security is going to be a major issue because of the control the Russians have over our gas.<\/p>  <p>  To summarise, having this conversation is not alarmist in any shape or form.  These are normal, prudent, sensible and responsible discussions.  They are happening all over Europe and need to happen here as well.  I would be grateful if the T&aacute;naiste would update the House accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000024#W00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1644496200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The Government continues to conduct appropriate contingency planning that considers a number of perspectives, including consular support for citizens.  At the same time it is important to remember that intensive international efforts to secure a negotiated diplomatic resolution to the tensions are ongoing.  At the moment there are no plans to withdraw staff or evacuate our embassy in Kyiv.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to keep the security situation under review in line with its procedures on ensuring the security and safety of our staff there.  On 22 January the Department updated its travel advice for Ukraine and advised that people should avoid non-essential travel to the country.  We will be continuing to keep this advice under review.  We also continue to advise that all Irish citizens in Ukraine should register with the Irish Embassy in Kyiv so they can receive consular assistance and be evacuated from the country should the need arise.<\/p>  <p>  I state once again that the Government strongly supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  We believe that should be respected.  We also respect and support the right of the people of Ukraine to determine their own affairs and their right of sovereignty.  They have the right to decide they wish to join the European Union or to decide they wish to join NATO.  Those should always be decisions for the elected Ukrainian Government and not to be determined by others or imposed on it by anyone else.<\/p>  <p>  At present we have made no provision for financial aid to neighbouring countries but we absolutely acknowledge that were there to be a conflict, as well as loss of human life, there would likely be significant refugee flows into Romania and Poland in particular.  In that scenario we anticipate the EU solidarity clause would be triggered and we would be required, but also willing and happy, to assist Romania and Poland in any way we can should that situation arise.  That would also involve, under European arrangements, being willing to take a number of refugees from Ukraine, which we would be willing to do.  However, all efforts at the moment are aimed at avoiding such a scenario because we know a land war between Russia and Ukraine would result in tens of thousands of deaths and probably hundreds of thousands of people being internally displaced or fleeing to Romania and Poland.  Nobody wants that situation to arise so diplomatic efforts are under way to avoid conflict in the region.  Crucially, that cannot mean sacrificing the sovereignty and autonomy of Ukraine and the right of its people and democratically elected Government to determine their own affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000024#W00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1644496200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his reply.

The Deputy makes a very valid point in that regard.  Obviously, the first response is to protect our citizens in Ukraine and to ensure they are safe and can get out if they need to.  The second is a wider humanitarian response to help people who may be displaced or have to flee.  The third of course relates to issues around energy supplies.

As we speak, there are thousands of families with properties crumbling around them in counties Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Limerick and Clare.  Families in Clare still do not have certainty as to whether they will be included in the current defective block redress scheme, inadequate and all as the scheme is.  Families in Mayo and Donegal have had to endure increasing frustration at the last minute introduction of a sliding scale to the so-called enhanced scheme last year and the particularly weak conditions included in the departmental memorandum published this week whereby the scheme may only cover remediation to 2007 building standards, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, that would be illegal.  The scheme will also exclude other crucial remediation activities, such as works to the foundations.  We do not even know when that legislation is going to be introduced, let alone whether a scheme will be available for the affected families to apply for this year.  That situation is completely unacceptable and contrary to the promises of the Government.<\/p><p>Likewise, tens of thousands of families are living in houses, apartments and duplexes with significant building defects from the Celtic tiger era, including safety issues and water ingress.  While a working group was set up, as committed to in the programme for Government, it has missed its deadline and may not report before the summer of this year.  It is still not clear whether any effective redress for those homeowners will be in place in time for budget 2023.<\/p><p>The programme for Government also contains a clear commitment to review the building control regime, which is welcome.  It includes a reference to a cross-party Oireachtas committee report, Safe as Houses, that I authored and that was approved by a committee in 2018.  It recommended a wide range of further reforms that are needed.  Those reforms are crucial because if we are to see an expansion of residential building activity, we need to ensure we learn from the mistakes of the past.<\/p><p>The Bill I am introducing makes one relatively small but significant change to the Planning and Development Acts.  Currently, when a local authority or planning authority is assessing a planning application, it cannot take into account whether the applicant previously breached planning conditions or failed to complete a previous planning application.  Those authorities are not allowed to take into account any previous breaches of building control regulations, which is something planning authorities speak to us about all the time.  This Bill, which has been through the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, would empower local authorities when assessing any new planning application to take into account previous breaches of building control regulations by developers.<\/p><p>Why is this important?  In my constituency today, there is a development, which has been well reported on by the newspapers, where the developer refurbished an old gym into 48 apartments in complete breach not only of planning, because there was no planning either through the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but also of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.  Not a single certificate was submitted and that case is currently subject to planning enforcement with South Dublin County Council.  That developer should not get planning permission for any development ever again.<\/p> <p>That developer has put the residents, some of whom have come from emergency accommodation and homelessness, in a situation where they are in a building that is not only technically illegal but potentially of significant risk to the adults and children who live there.  If tomorrow that developer applies for planning permission for another development in South Dublin County Council, he or she is not permitted under law to take into account those very clear and unquestionable breaches of building control in the planning application.<\/p> <p> This is very simple and sensible.  I hope when we bring forward this Bill in Private Members' time that the Government will take its merit at face value, take into account the efforts both of my team and the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers in drafting this Bill and support it so that our planning authorities have every tool available to ensure rogue builders and developers with a history of defective building are not allowed to secure planning permission and continue to build defective buildings into the future.  On that basis, I am introducing the Bill at First Stage today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000027#Z01500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644498600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000028#AA00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1644498600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000028#AA00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644498600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1644498600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000028#AA00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1644498600,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000028#AA00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644498600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644498600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ag 1.11 p.m. go dt&iacute; 1.51 p.m. \r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 1.11 p.m. and resumed at 1.51 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1644498900,"counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000029#EE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1644498900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on this Bill, which will facilitate the transfer of specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Broader disability equality policy is already the responsibility of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth following the transfer from the Minister for Justice in late 2020.  After this transfer from the Department of Health, responsibility for disability equality policy and specialist community-based disability services will be centralised in a single Department for the first time.  The HSE will retain responsibility for delivering the services.<\/p>  <p>  The location of disability equality policy and specialist community-based disability services in a single Department will facilitate strategic policy development, including implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which Ireland ratified in 2018, as well as the significant reforms envisioned under the transforming lives programme.  Under the convention, and following the transfer of the equality function, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be the national focal point and the co-ordination mechanism for implementation of the UNCRPD.  Consolidation of the disability function represents a significant opportunity to further the progressive realisation of the convention in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Assigning overall responsibility for disability matters and key resources to a single Department will enable the Government to strengthen approaches to co-ordination and offers the potential for future improvements in service delivery, including reviews of resources, to maximise the benefits for service users.  This is particularly important given many of the issues arising for people with disabilities are cross-government in nature.  The centralisation of the equality, health and social care dimensions of support for people with disabilities will facilitate the transition from a medical model of support towards an holistic, rights-based approach that supports people with disabilities to live autonomously.  Reflecting this change in philosophy in disability policy and service delivery will be crucial for meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the UNCRPD.  The transfer of these key policy responsibilities provides an opportunity to look anew and critically review how specialist community-based disability services are being delivered.  It will allow us to examine how the service offering can be improved to facilitate greater flexibility, choice and control from the service user's perspective.<\/p>  <p>  After the transfer of policy responsibilities takes place, the governance arrangements for the transfer are that the HSE will retain service delivery responsibility and provide a framework for close co-operation between the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This will ensure that people with disabilities will continue to have access to integrated and mainstream health and personal social services.  It will also ensure that specialist community-based disability services benefit from, and are in line with, ongoing reform efforts including under Sl&aacute;intecare.  As the HSE will continue to deliver the services, the transfer therefore requires it to report to two Ministers for different elements of its functions.  The Bill seeks to put in place a legislative basis to enable this and includes provisions on accountability arrangements for the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  This aims to ensure that both Ministers have the necessary authority in their respective areas of responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  I will now outline some sections.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 defines the Acts referred to in the Bill.

37 amends the 2004 Act regarding the power to require the executive to furnish information and documents to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of specialist community-based disability services where the Minister considers it necessary in the public interest to do so for the performance their functions.  The executive will furnish the information within any period that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth may specify and, in any event, without delay.<\/p> <p> Section 38 amends the 2004 Act with regard to the Minister&rsquo;s power to share information and documents that relate to specialist community-based disability services in specified circumstances.<\/p> <p> Section 39 amends the 2004 Act regarding the Minister&rsquo;s power to use information and documents that relate to specialist community-based disability services.<\/p> <p> Section 40 amends section 40F of the 2004 Act to include the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p> <p> Section 41 amends section 40H of the 2004 Act by replacing the requirement of the board to appoint a chairperson of the audit committee from among the committee&rsquo;s external members, with a provision allowing the board to appoint a chairperson from among any of the members of the committee.<\/p> <p> Section 42 amends section 40I of the 2004 Act relating to the functions of the executive's audit committee and its obligation to provide a copy of the reports advising the CEO and the board on financial matters to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p> <p> Section 42 amends the 2004 Act to provide for consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of convening a national health consultative forum.<\/p> <p> Section 44 amends the 2004 Act by giving the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the power to direct the executive to establish an advisory panel for a specified purpose in respect of specialist community-based disability services.<\/p> <p> Section 45 amends the 2004 Act to provide for consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of making regulations relating to complaints.<\/p> <p> Sections 46 and 47 amend the 2004 Act so that the Government may make provision regarding the processes and procedures by which the functions of the Minister for Health or the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are exercised by an order under section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.  Any such orders shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> Section 48 amends the 2004 Act by deleting the word \"ordinary\" to allow for a quorum of seven members of the board.  The transfer of functions requires the sectoral plan currently under the responsibility of the Minister for Health to be divided between him and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to reflect the transfer of responsibilities between the two Ministers.  Sections 49 to 51, inclusive, amend the Disability Act 2005 to provide for this.<\/p> <p> Section 52 amends section 2 of the Health Act 2007 by the insertion of the definition of \"specialist community-based disability functions\".<\/p> <p> Section 53 amends section 9 of the Health Act 2007 to allow the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to require the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to undertake an investigation in the context of specialist community-based disability services.<\/p> <p> Sections 54 to 58, inclusive, amend relevant sections of the Health Act 2007 to extend the power to make regulations to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of those areas which are transferring.<\/p> <p> Section 59 provides for definitions that appear in Part 5, including \"health and personal social services\", \"specialist community-based disability services\" and \"specialist community-based disability services functions\".<\/p> <p> Section 60 provides for administrative co-operation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to allow them to enter into arrangements which will facilitate administrative efficiency and co-operation, the avoidance of duplication of activities by the executive and the sharing of information relevant to the employment of persons.<\/p> <p> Section 61 provides for a review process to include an evaluation of the delivery of specialist community-based disability services and an examination of the integration of services for persons who have a disability.  The review will be carried out no later than three years after the commencement of this section.<\/p> <p> Sections 62 and 63 are quite technical sections relating to functions being deemed to have been valid in certain circumstances if, at the time of the performance or purported performance of the function, the relevant Minister believed that the function was vested in him or her by virtue of the amendments to the principal Act effected by this Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 64 provides for the determination of disputes in connection with the amendments in this Bill and the performance of functions in this Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 65 provides for the cessation of the functions of the Minister for Health in respect of specialist community-based disability services functions from the commencement of this section.<\/p> <p>I know there are a lot of technical amendments here.  The purpose was to allow the transfer of specialist community-based disability services to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to take place.  I believe this will be a positive step for the reasons I outlined earlier.   There will, of course, be an opportunity to discuss this in more detail at Committee Stage.

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose.  It gives effect to the Government decision to transfer responsibility for specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We can now add \"disability\" to that Long Title.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill, while largely technical, is quite substantive and will ostensibly bring an additional layer of accountability for the development and provision of disability services once fully implemented.  It will give the  Minister the power to give directions and set priorities for the HSE in the delivery of these disability services and make it separately accountable to the Minister for them.  However, that will not automatically improve disability services.  This will require substantial sustained investment and services to train and retain more occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and other specialists in the empowerment of people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Many challenges in this area need be addressed urgently.  The absolute priority must be tackling waiting lists and reducing wait times.  This must be done across a range of services to improve access to assessment of need for children and especially young people.  We must improve access to speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, counselling and the wide-ranging supports many children and adults need to help them live a full and independent life.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for children's mental health remains with the Department of Health but there is an onus on the Minister with responsibility for children and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability not to lose sight of the toll on children's mental health that is caused by obscene waiting lists for disability services and the difficulties that being differently abled in this world can bring.  At the end of last year, 4,000 children were still waiting for an assessment of need and more still were waiting for further diagnostic assessment.  In the south east, more than 1,000 children are waiting for diagnostic assessment.  The Ombudsman for Children cited one case of a 6-year-old who has been waiting for assessment for four years.  That is an unacceptably long wait.  An unacceptably high number of children who are waiting when a child's entitlement to this assessment is, and should be, within three months.<\/p>  <p>  There are also significant concerns that due to pressures services are under as a result of understaffing, assessments are not being carried out as thoroughly or extensively as even the professionals carrying out the assessments would like.  We have all heard anecdotal evidence from those professionals in that regard.  We see it in many areas in healthcare.  We saw it with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and see it in other areas where real pressures with regard to staffing capacity can make life very difficult for those trying to provide services.  That is without going into the thousands of children and adults on waiting lists for speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and counselling.<\/p>  <p> In more recent times, a person does not need a diagnosis and, essentially, the assessment for some of the services to follow but in practice, that is not always the case.  The experience of many families when it comes to their children is that the range of therapies a child needs are not always provided.  It can be very patchy; a bit here and a bit there.  Very often, they have to battle with the system to actually get the services a child needs.  It is all down to a lack of capacity.  We have a system.  Those at regional level are trying their best to provide the service to as many children as possible but it is equivalent of the loaves and fishes in trying to do it.  We must, therefore, advocate for all those children.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the way in which society currently operates places many barriers in the way of differently abled people.  They have been consistently disadvantaged by a lack of State supports to overcome these barriers.  This has led to disempowerment, dependence and a loss of control and choice in people's lives.  To counteract this, it is incumbent on the Minister of State to ensure a real whole-of-government approach to empowerment and to deliver a new social model of disability inclusion.  I hope she will work closely not only with the HSE and Minister for Health in improving the health and social care services people with disabilities need, but also with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure appropriate housing provision, the Minister for Social Protection to ensure adequate income supports and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure everyone's right to work is not impeded by obstacles that people with a disability have to face because, unfortunately, they are different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000031#GG00500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1644500100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and the resulting transfer of statutory responsibility for disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This transfer is not before time.  The Joint Committee on Disability Matters had been requesting information on when this would happen for more than a year and a half and was initially told it was going to happen a year ago.  I welcome that it has happened at long last.<\/p>  <p>  Disability is not solely a health matter.  It is good then that the transfer is occurring in recognition of that.  There is a need to move away from the medical model of disability and embrace a rights-based model.  We need to view disability as caused by the way society is organised rather than by a person's impairment or difference.  We need to look at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for disabled people in order that when these barriers are removed, disabled people can be independent and equal in society with choice and control over their lives.<\/p>  <p>  The ratification of the UNCRPD in 2018 was a step in the right direction in this sense.  There is still a long way to go before the social model is truly embraced, however.  The optional protocol of the convention has not yet been ratified.  While this is the case, disabled people have little or no recourse if their rights under the UNCRPD are not upheld. <\/p>  <p>  The disability capacity review highlights the scale of the work required in specialist community-based disability services.  Changing demographics and the current level of unmet need means that major budget increases will be essential.  Access to housing and independent living supports are also essential to a rights-based model of disability but so far, approximately 1,800 disabled people are still living in large residential settings.  The congregation process has been a failure.  Very few people have been transferred from large residential settings to community living since 2012 when the time to move on from congregated sessions was published.  In fact, the disability capacity review informs us that by the end of 2018, approximately 800 of the 1,500 people who no longer resided in one of these centres had transitioned to the community but approximately 700 had sadly passed away.  Approximately 1,300 disabled people under the age of 65 are currently residing in nursing homes because we do not have the supported living settings for them to live with their peers in the community.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Ombudsman's report, Wasted Lives: Time for a Better Future for Younger People in Nursing Homes, the HSE committed to transitioning 18 people under the age of 65 from nursing homes.  That is less than 2%.  Currently, the rate of poverty and social exclusion for disabled people in Ireland is one of the highest in the EU at 38.1%.  The poverty rate for disabled people was exacerbated by the 2008 financial economic crisis and subsequent response to austerity as the poverty rate for disabled people consistently increased from 9% in 2009 to 24% by 2017.<\/p>  <p>  They are obviously adversely affected by the current rise in the cost of living.  A European Commission report on Ireland published in 2019 revealed that Ireland has one of the lowest employment rates for people with disabilities in the EU at 26.2% compared with the EU average of 48.1%.  Among disabled people aged 15 to 30, 13.7% have not progressed any higher than primary level education in comparison with 4.2% of the general population.  There is a data deficit when it comes to disability.  Data from various Departments needs to be married to ensure the most comprehensive person-centred responses can be delivered.  Without baseline data it would be very hard to track success or otherwise in disability services.<\/p>  <p>  We were informed that the backlog of children and young people waiting on an assessment of needs increased from 500 in the summer to almost 4,000 in November 2021.  I am told by the children's disability network teams, CDNT, that children all over the country are not receiving therapies.  Parents are being given courses and told to assist their children at home.<\/p> <p>Parents are not qualified therapists and this should not be their responsibility.  Children's disability network teams must be properly resourced and staffed.<\/p> <p> Ireland is rich in policy and relevant legislation but we are constantly and consistently weak on implementation.  There are notable parts of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, the Disability Act and the Citizens Information Act, which are the pillars of disability inclusion legislation, that have not been implemented.  While I welcome this Bill and the resulting transfer of statutory responsibilities for disability service delivery, it is only right to point out the scale of the work facing us in delivering for this sector is huge.  A change in faces, Departments or Ministers will not in itself bring about that delivery if the political will does not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000031#GG00600","speaker":"1513","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644500700,"counter":420,"content":"<p>This is largely a technical Bill to give effect to the Government's decision to transfer a function from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in regard to the provision of specialist, community-based disability services.  I hope it not just window dressing.  The Government's focus should be on improving disability services and making them fit for purpose.  This Bill and all its 65 sections will not achieve anything in the here and now.  It is like rearranging the deckchairs on <i>Titanic<\/i>.<\/p><p>Ireland remains one of only three EU states not to have ratified the protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which would give people with a disability the right to take their case to the UN.  Psychosocial disabilities are mental health disabilities and people have rights in this regard under the CRPD.  Even though most of the disability remit is moving to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, this does not mean the Department of Health will not be accountable under the CRPD for the needs of people with psychosocial disabilities.  Neither Department can exclude people with mental health difficulties and the Government will need to ensure their rights are respected and their voices included.<\/p><p>God forbid if children with a disability had the right to take cases to the UN arising from the State's abject failure to provide disability supports.  The UN would not know what hit it.  At present, there are more than 71,000 children with disabilities waiting for life-changing treatment, including occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology, dietetics, physiotherapy and many others.  It is concerning that more than 19,000 of these children are waiting longer than a year, and many of them much longer, with no light at the end of the tunnel for desperate parents.  I have pointed out before to the Minister of State that the Ombudsman for Children has described provision in this area as an old-fashioned three-card trick whereby children are moved from list to list without getting the necessary treatment at the end of it.<\/p><p>The Government has abjectly failed to get to grips with the cost of living crisis facing workers and families.  I mention this because I want to put it into context in terms of what it means for parents of children with disabilities facing these never-ending lists for treatment.  Earlier this month, at a meeting of the children's committee to discuss child poverty, we heard from representatives of the Clondalkin Cares Food Bank, which is based in my area, that parents are accessing its service who find themselves in poverty because they cannot access timely treatment for their children with disabilities.  These parents have had to find private providers to give their children the life-changing treatments, such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, which the Government should be providing.  They have simply had to make a choice between putting food on the table and accessing the treatments their children desperately need and deserve.  No parent should be put in this impossible position.  Yesterday, a parent contacted me to say she is way behind on her bills as she has had to pay more than &euro;2,000 this year alone to a private provider for therapy for her child.  Will the cost of living measures the Government is to announce address this problem?  I do not think so.  Will moving the responsibility for provision to another Department address the issue here and now?  I do not think so.<\/p><p>Behind every one of the statistics I mentioned is a child.  These are children who, because of the Government's failures, have missed many opportunities in life.  They are children who are not reaching their full potential or their developmental milestones.  Last week, we had a long debate in this House on the misdiagnosis and mistreatment of children by the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in south Kerry.  I met some of those parents in Tralee last week and their stories are absolutely heartbreaking.  Parents, and I include myself in this, trust medical experts when it comes to our children's care, but trust seems to be at an all-time low in this regard.  These parents and children were so badly treated that words fail me.  The problem is not confined to south Kerry.  We have heard similar stories in north Kerry, Cork and Wexford, and I suspect they are just the tip of the iceberg.  While the responsibility for mental health provision will not be moving Departments under this Bill, one of the common themes from the parents to whom I spoke was their belief that one of the reasons their children were overmedicated was that they were not receiving the therapies they needed, including occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, simply because those services are not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000032#HH00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1644500700,"counter":421,"content":"<p>As other speakers have noted, this legislation is about moving responsibility for a particular sector from one Minister to another.  It will not have the effect we would very much like to see, which is the provision of additional funding and resources in this area.  There will be clarity now in that responsibility for disability services will be under the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, retaining her function in that area.  There is still a great deal of work to be done.  The optional UN protocol has not been implemented, which would give people legal recourse.  That move needs to happen urgently.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State is aware, the North West Parents and Friends Association in my constituency provides many services for children and adults with disabilities.  I have spoken to her before about how that organisation is continually under-resourced.  It is based in Sligo and has outreach services in Leitrim and other areas.  The stories I hear of the difficulties it faces in getting service level agreements in place to provide adequate service to the children and adults it deals with are heartbreaking.  The service is continually in battle with the HSE.  I encourage the Minister of State to step in and play a positive role in changing that.  I invite her to the constituency to meet with the people involved, particularly the staff of St. Ciaran's service in Carrick-on-Shannon, which provides both day services and respite services.  I am aware of a situation whereby one service user will have to go into full-time care, which is having a knock-on effect in that others are unable to access respite care.<\/p>  <p>  This type of situation is a reflection of an ongoing problem whereby we do not have in place the facilities and services that are needed.  There is a genuine sense of fear and apprehension among parents who are ageing and are very fearful their adult child who lives with them and whom they want to care for and look after for as long as they possibly can may well outlive them and what will happen then.  The stress and mental torture of that is one of the key issues.  Those parents look at the current service and wonder where it will be in five or ten years' time when they are not able to cope or are no longer here.  This is the issue that needs to be addressed and new facilities must be put in place.  Action is what we require.  There have been numerous plans but what is needed is action.

Following on from some of the conversations I have had with the Minister of State, there is obviously a logic to what is being done here.  I know she had intentions to go to Dundalk and has planned for a further visit.  We have dealt with certain issues in regard to disability but what we are lacking, as per normal, is a service for children and adults with disabilities that is fit for purpose and operates for the entirety of their lives.  Not only was there an anomaly in terms of where certain powers lay within the Department of Health, which should perhaps have been with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, but we are also dealing with the fact that some of the issues relate to housing, local government and other areas.  I refer to instances, for examples, where people are trying to access housing that is suitable for children with particular acute difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  I am very thankful for the work the Minister of State is doing in bringing forward this legislation.<\/p> <p>It is also about providing the services, whether those are under the local authority or whatever, with a roadmap for delivery.  That is the big thing we need across the board.  Everyone has been clear that we are all inundated with parents, families and, particularly, mothers who are under severe pressure, whether they are seeking autism spectrum disorder, ASD, services, occupational therapy, physiotherapy or speech and language therapy.  This is about making sure we can make those services much easier to access and that it can be done in a much more streamlined fashion.  We all know the difficulty even to get on the list for assessment of need, never mind the difficulties that can occur when somebody gets the service.<\/p> <p> We have seen the recent issues relating to CAMHS.  Generally, the complaint is that a person cannot get into the service, but in these cases the issue was that the service was not fit for purpose.  That is not good enough for the citizens and the people.  A huge piece of work needs to be done, from family supports to community supports for disabilities right across the board.

I would be interested in hearing from the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, if she is summing up at the end - I am not sure if she will be - because there are concerns when there are such changes.  Everyone has said that this is a technical Bill etc., but technical changes can and do have real impacts.<\/p>  <p>  One of our concerns is that the brief of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is a big one.  While we have an able Minister in that brief, and there is no doubt about that, it is a huge brief and disability is a massive area.  We have been discussing disability thus far in this debate through the prism of health because we are separating the functions from the Minister for Health in some areas.  However, we are looking as a society to disability-proof transport.  We spoke at the transport committee yesterday about our new fleet of buses and trains, access to train stations, and active travel through a disability lens.  When we look at housing and we are talking about congregated settings and decongregation, we must make sure there are houses in which people disabilities can live and not just access.  That is something I have learned over recent years: the difference between people with disabilities having access to a house and actually having a house or home in which a person with a disability can live.  There are also the issues of access to jobs, access to the labour market and implications in that regard, industrial relations matters as they pertain to people with disabilities, and workers in that area, such as section 39 workers.  Therefore, this is a massive area of policy for the Minister who has responsibility for disability.<\/p>  <p>  We spoke to the Minister in recent months since I took over the health brief about the disability capacity review, the cost of living for people with a disability, all the waiting lists and the services.  These are all massive issues.  We can go down the list, which I have here, but we will discuss it again. <\/p>  <p>  In this particular debate, given the content of this Bill, I want to hear what concerns are held on the Government side about how the new system will work?  On the HSE side of things, service delivery will be under the responsibility of two Ministers.  It will rely on two Ministers, as well as the Minister of State, having good working relationships.  Whoever the Ministers are now and whoever the Ministers will be in the future, when it comes to budget time, how will this work?  Will the Minister with responsibility for disability have to go cap in hand as a senior Minister to the Minister for Health before going to the Minister for Finance?  These are the practical things I would like to hear about.  I am not trying to catch anyone out for anything, but I just want to clear on these things.  One of the worst things that can happen in any area of public services is siloing, whereby one section, organisation or Department does not talk to another.  This is one area where we can have no siloing and where people really have to work together.  We are talking about robust communication and reporting mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  This is a long Bill.  The Minister read out many sections.  Therefore, this is not a quick technical Bill; it is a detailed technical Bill.  To give comfort to those who are at every level of the disability sector, be they service users or service providers, as well as those in the disability sector who are in areas unrelated to the delivery of health, such as in transport or all of the other areas I laid out, it is important to outline how that reporting will work?  How will those relationships be managed?  How can we ensure we are not taking a couple of steps backwards due to new bureaucracies and that, instead, this will actually help us move forward, cut down the waiting lists and bring a disability focus on policy to all those other areas?<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and, indeed, to the summing up at the end of the debate, whenever that may be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000033#JJ00300","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1644501300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the publication of this Bill, which marks a significant milestone in the transfer of specialist community-based disability services from the Department of Health to my own Department.

Equally, I will continue to engage with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to ensure integrated policymaking and governance of the HSE.

This will obviously be in addition to our current remit for disability equality policy, which transferred from the Department of Justice in late 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The consolidation of these features into one Department presents a significant opportunity to improve the lives of people with disabilities in Ireland.  The transfer will facilitate the transition from what is sometimes, as many Deputies here have described it, a more medical mode of support, towards an holistic, rights-based approach that supports people with disabilities to live autonomously.  It will support the HSE to continue to develop a more person-centred service.  This evolution philosophy is crucial for Ireland to meet the obligations to which we signed up in recent years when we signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  That document provides a blueprint for strengthening the rights of people with disabilities and promoting their inclusion in all aspects of society.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are committed to delivering real and tangible benefits for service users throughout the country.  A number of Deputies have spoken about the UNCRPD and particularly about the optional protocol.  The Minister of State and I have been clear that we want to see Ireland sign up to the optional protocol.  Key to doing that and to bringing about the legal changes, because we need to change our existing legal regime to bring us into compliance with that, is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, legislation that is overdue.  Everyone accepts that is overdue, but it is now at pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS.  It is before the Oireachtas joint committee on children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are eager for that to be examined quickly.  We want to have that in place by June 2022 for the decision supports service, which is a vital new service that will replace wardship.  Wardship is a very outdated approach to dealing with the decision-making rules and capacity of persons with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities.  That needs to be replaced.  We have this system and we just need to get that Bill through PLS quickly so that we can get it into the Houses and get it passed.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to this Bill and to the transfer of functions, the HSE will obviously be a key partner in this regard.  I have been in contact with the chair of the HSE board to express my commitment, as a Minister who now has an accountability relationship with the HSE board, to talk about working closely with the HSE to support this delivery of enhanced services for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>My officials meet regularly with HSE senior management in preparation for the transfer, and the Secretary General of my Department will soon be meeting with the CEO of the HSE to advance these arrangements further.<\/p> <p> This Bill brings us one step closer to centralising the equality, health and social care dimensions of support for people with disabilities within my Department.  This will place us in a strong position to lead efforts to improve the lives of people with disabilities in Ireland.  Deputy Duncan Smith said this Bill can have a real impact.  We want it to have a real impact.  We want this to be a fundamental change in how Ireland approaches the holistic rights of persons with disabilities.  The Deputy rightly pointed out there is a large range of responsibilities within my Department, but we also have to accept there is a huge range of responsibilities within the Department of Health and it has a huge budget.  It was identified during the programme for Government negotiations, primarily by the Taoiseach, that disability was an issue that needed more attention.  That is what we are seeking to give it, while also bringing the various elements together within one Department.<\/p> <p> On the budgetary arrangements, funding for community-based disability services will be sought by me or successive Ministers in my Department and the budgetary line will be through Vote 40 within my Department.  That Vote is going to transfer over.  Good co-operation between me, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has already been demonstrated by the very successful budgetary allocations Deputy Rabbitte has achieved in both of the previous two budgets.  On both occasions there was a significant increase in financial support for community-based disability services.<\/p> <p> There is a huge amount more to be done.  None of us is under any illusion about the scale of the work that has to be done to provide community-based disability services, to provide more therapists, to continue to reduce the waiting lists and to implement the huge number of legal changes required.  We also need to integrate those changes with transport and social welfare.  The work the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has done over the past 18 months in putting a focus on these issues is recognised across this House and across the sector.  I look forward to her area of responsibility fully transferring to my Department and us jointly working to continue to advance this issue.  There is a huge amount to do here.  We are absolutely cognisant of that and that work will continue when there are other Ministers in this role.  This Bill is a very important first step towards delivering that better, human rights-based focus and integrated services for persons with disabilities in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000033#JJ00400","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644501900,"counter":427,"content":"<p>This Bill makes the HSE accountable to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for the management and delivery of specialist community-based disability services.  I hope the transfer of responsibilities in this Bill will result in a system that has more focus on providing for people with disabilities in their community.  However, the Bill will not change anything in terms of the ability of people and children with disabilities to get timely access to the services they need in the community.  The phrase \"care in the community\" has been misused by the Department of Health ever since it was coined.  There are plans to close key services in communities across my county of Tipperary based on the principle that more focus is being given to care in the home.  However, this has actually resulted in community services being relocated.  Care in the community no longer means care in your own community.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir and Roscrea will attest to that.  I need the Minister to bear that in mind as he takes on these new responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill does not address the fact that children with disabilities are being forced to wait incredible lengths of time for the formal diagnosis that would trigger the supports and services they need.  There is a young girl in my constituency who had an assessment of need process in October 2020 and that was completed in January 2021.  This identified that she required the services of a children's disability network team, CDNT, and that an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment was warranted.  She is still waiting for that diagnostic appointment.  In the meantime, the family have been told that despite there being general agreement that she has a disability and needs supports such as the domiciliary care allowance, she does not qualify for it because the formal diagnosis she is waiting for has not been done.  This is getting in the way of her family being able to make plans for her at home and for her schooling.  In another case, a young man with muscular dystrophy was left without home care supports because his parents had Covid at the time.  This has since been resolved but they had to fight for it.<\/p>  <p>  There are pitfalls across the board when it comes to the provision of services for people with disabilities.  I recently attended a meeting with the HSE's south-east office.  It is undertaking a number of recruitment campaigns for occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and so on because of the huge shortage in this area.  While I appreciate this, it is the people with needs who are being impacted.  The Government may try to take the heat off by highlighting its good intentions, but this does not take the pressure off people with disabilities and their families.  They are forced to wait because successive governments have mismanaged the health service so much that it is no longer an attractive prospect for many specialists.  These are the challenges that await the Minister.  I appeal to him to look closely at how the idea of care in the community is being used by this Government as a way actually to take care out of our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000034#KK00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1644501900,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill.  I particularly welcome the move from a health-dominated approach to disability to an equality and rights-based one.  It is a very welcome development.  Viewing disability primarily through a health lens has created a very narrow focus, one that is so narrow that it has been rejected by people with disabilities, their advocates and people working in the field.  In that respect, I welcome this move.  There is no doubt there has been far too much emphasis on people's actual disabilities and not enough on the voices, experiences and abilities of people living with disabilities.  As Des Kenny, chair of Independent Living Movement Ireland, put it, the Department must recognise \"that it is how society is structured that disables people, and our lack of participation and inclusion in society is not due to our impairments\".  That is important.  It is society, the structures and the system that need to change.<\/p>  <p>  For decades, disability campaigners have sought to ensure the rights of people living with disabilities are addressed at a full ministerial level.  The scale of disability in this country, the number of people living with disabilities, the scale of the services to be provided across a wide range of Departments, and the level of funding needed raise the question whether there is a need for a senior Minister.  While the Bill is certainly an improvement, we have to ask ourselves what exactly is going to happen now.  The fear is that all the Bill will entail is the movement of a Minister of State, albeit one who is able and has been a good fighter for the sector, from one Department to another.  Is it much more than that?  The detail of what is required to be done and the budget involved raise these questions.<\/p>  <p>  Disability will now be the biggest element of the budget in the Department, at &euro;2.3 billion.  Yet, it is still a Minister of State dealing with that massive budget.  This transfer will more than double the budget of the existing Department.  If disability had a Department in its own right, it would have a budget greater than 11 other Departments.  That puts some perspective on it.  One has to ask why it is just added onto another Department.  Some 13.5% of our population have a disability, yet we cannot find room in a Cabinet of 15 for a dedicated Minister.  That is a problem.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the focus on disability over the past decade has related to service provider funding, which has not yet recovered from cutbacks introduced in the recession.  I know the Minister appreciates that.  While this is undoubtedly an important issue, successive governments have forgotten about the service users caught in the middle of protracted stand-offs between the HSE and service providers.  We have often lost sight of the fact that social exclusion is the predominant issue for people living with disabilities.  A recent ESRI report found that Ireland has the fourth lowest employment rate in the EU for people living with disabilities, at a mere 36%.<\/p> <p> Some 27% of the homeless population have a disability.  More than 1,400 people living with disabilities under the age of 65 are actually in nursing homes.  It is shameful that we are seeing this institutionalisation and that it still features so heavily in policy.  These are the lived experiences of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> The publication of the disability capacity review last July after a long delay detailed the significant unmet needs of people living with disabilities.  It estimated that in the next decade there will be a need for a further &euro;550 million to &euro;1 billion investment in disability services.  Despite disability being an issue that affects so many families, the capacity review's estimate suggests that disability is generally one of the most underfunded areas of public expenditure.<\/p> <p> Budget 2022, in my view, failed to tackle the historic underspend in disability with a more-of-the-same approach to addressing shortfalls.  It is not good enough merely to recognise the issues faced by people living with disabilities.  We must address them in a meaningful way.  Instead, this Government is continuing to let issues fester until they become urgent or, in many cases, an emergency.  We need to move from crisis interventions to rights-based supports.<\/p> <p> The UNCRPD is clear on the need to eradicate poverty for people living with disabilities.  Article 28, which is concerned with an adequate standard of living and social protection, requires states to \"ensure access by persons with disabilities ... to social protection programmes and poverty reduction programmes\".  People living with disabilities in Ireland have among the highest rates of poverty &ndash; three times that of the general population.  They are at the sharp end of our housing and cost of living crises.  Additional costs, such as specialist aids and equipment, home adaptations, higher energy costs and extra transportation costs, particularly taxis, are realities of people's lives when they are living with disabilities.  These additional costs must be addressed yet, in section 51, there is no mention of the Ministers for Transport; Housing, Local Government and Heritage; Education; or Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, or their Departments, having a role in responding to the needs of people living with disabilities.<\/p> <p> I do not know what the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be in relation to those Departments.  She will need a big stick or a good pair of boots to deal with this matter.  There needs to be clear roles and responsibilities outlined in relation to that.  That raises the issue of the delegation of functions.  I do not know if that has yet been resolved but it is traditionally a thorny issue within Departments and between senior Ministers and Ministers of State.  It is essential that the Minister of State has clear delegation of functions in relation to not only the new Department but also the Departments of Health; Transport; and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as the other relevant Departments.  Transport and housing, in particular, are major issues for people living with disabilities.<\/p> <p> In December 2021, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s cost of disability report concluded that the typical annual costs faced by people living with severe disabilities amount to up to &euro;12,300, and possibly up to &euro;10,000 for people with more limited disabilities, in order to get by and have any kind of life that they can live with dignity.  The full report details the lack of supports available to people living with disabilities and the severe challenges they face.  It is all there in black and white.  It cannot be disputed.  It is set out and nobody can complain that they did not know.  The report must not be allowed to gather dust on a shelf along with other reports on the cost of disability - one in the 1990s and one in the 2000s.  It should immediately inform policy to address the extra cost of living with a disability, ensure our public services are accessible and create pathways to employment and other supports.<\/p> <p> In 2018, 12 years after it was agreed by the UN, Ireland was the last EU country to ratify the UNCRPD.  We find ourselves in a situation where there are still major questions about the Government's commitment to the optional protocol.  Much of our national legislation remains out of sync with the convention.  Disability legislation, such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, is still not fully commenced.  I look forward to further detail on what the senior Minister announced earlier.  Is it any wonder that this Government still has not ratified the optional protocol when it and the previous Government dragged their feet so much in relation to these essential elements of dealing with the issue of disability?  The Government claims that it needs to do more work before signing this protocol but this is clearly a delaying tactic as the Government does not want to be held to account over its failures to uphold the rights of people living with disabilities.<\/p> <p> On a related note, mental health comes under the remit of the UNCRPD.  If we are truly committed to implementing the UNCRPD, people experiencing mental health difficulties will be using this convention to exercise their rights but the budget for mental health will sit apart from the Department with prime responsibility for the UNCRPD.  That is another organisational issue that needs to be resolved because that responsibility will fall on the new Department.<\/p> <p> The second class position of section 39 organisations is one of the key areas that needs to be addressed.  People who use section 39 services are significantly disadvantaged over those who use section 38 and HSE services.  This is primarily because of public funding and staffing arrangements.  Because of a lack of funding, staff are paid at a lower rate in section 39 organisations even though in many cases they do the same work as in the HSE and section 38 organisations.  This results in higher turnover of staff and much greater disruption for adults and children using these services.  It also means that service providers have extra costs in recruitment, training and other areas.  The funding system also leads to uncertainty with no multi-annual funding system, in spite of that being promised for some time.  People who receive services from section 39 organisations really value them.  The ethos and culture in those organisations is strong and supportive and this drives quality, dedication, commitment, specialisms and, fundamentally, a person-centred approach.  However, to make the sector sustainable, the funding and staffing arrangements need to be sustainable.<\/p> <p> Specifically on multi-annual funding, the HSE corporate plan published last year included a commitment to multi-annual funding.  The Catherine Day report, from 2019, recommended it.  The disability capacity review, published last July, recommended it.  It was committed to as part of the consultation on the forthcoming disability social care action plan but there are rumblings that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not signing up for this.  I wonder if that is the case because there is a strong rumour that it is.  It appears that the dead hand of the Department is striking again.  Without multi-annual funding it will be impossible ever to plan properly for the services to be provided in the years ahead.  It is critical to the success of this new arrangement.  The promise of multi-annual funding needs to be kept and it needs to be delivered on this year.<\/p> <p>It is positive that a review of the new arrangements is built into the Bill.  This will be important for addressing any potential issues that arise.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State said earlier that section 10 provides for:<\/p><blockquote>\t... consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of appointments of executive board members.  People with experience of advocacy in matters affecting recipients of services may now be selected as board members as well as those with experience in advocacy in matters affecting patients. <\/blockquote> <p>This is very welcome, as it will bring more lived experience to decision making.  The selection of people for this role should seek to represent the very broad spectrum of disability in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Section 64 appoints the Taoiseach as referee where there is a disagreement between Ministers.  I wish him luck with that.  How can the Taoiseach arbitrate on what in some cases will be a question of law?  That issue must be resolved.  Is it all very well for the Taoiseach to arbitrate.  I hope he will arbitrate where there are disagreements about the adequacy of funding that is provided.  The Minister has the clout to resolve those kinds of issues but in the case of questions of law, that is a harder one to understand.<br\/><br\/>Sections 3 and 59 appear to use different definitions of specialist community-based disability services.  Again, that is something that needs to be resolved.  On the question of resolving it, we do not have any clarity on the other Stages of this legislation.  The Bill is scheduled to continue next week, and I wonder when we are likely to complete Second Stage.  Given that this has been talked about for some time, the Bill appeared very quickly and there was very little time for various disability groups to give it adequate consideration.  That is an issue that has been raised with me.  I hope that prior to Committee and Report Stages, sufficient time will be allowed for the many organisations, individuals and advocacy groups to consider the full implications of the Bill and to have an input in terms of potential amendments.  I hope the Minister of State will be open to considering those amendments.<br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.  I restate the point about the delegation of functions.  It is particularly important.  The Minister of State's role is a very difficult one, as she must negotiate between a number of Departments.  If the role is to be meaningful, and if she is to have the necessary clout, there needs to be a very clear definition of functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000034#KK00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644503100,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  I also welcome the Bill before the House.  It is not before time.  I know there has been a significant effort and work put in to bring the Bill to the House.  It is a very important part of the programme for Government.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, has taken on the role with great energy, dedication and hard work.  I acknowledge that and I have seen it at first hand at a constituency level.  Her engagement with the Joint Committee on Disability Matters has shown that she is completely on top of the challenges that lie ahead, which are many, in the disability sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill concerns the movement of issues relating to disability from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It is right to do that.  The disability sector has been part of the Department of Health for some time, but it could be said it has been the Cinderella of the Department.  We must accept that.  In any debate on the Bill, we must accept the significant challenges that exist across the spectrum.  I intend to deal with some of the issues today.  I will start with the younger cohort of people.  When an issue arises, parents look for an assessment of need and a diagnosis and subsequently therapies.  There is a significant challenge in terms of the availability of therapies in the public sector.  In most cases, they are non-existent.  We must accept that service provision is currently that poor.  We must look at the challenges people face daily.  The challenges faced by parents include the cost, as outlined in the cost of disability report.  They must scrape together the money to provide occupational therapy and speech and language therapy for their children to give them the best possible outlook because they are not available on the public health system.  We must accept that right here and now.  We must look at the availability of therapists and how we are going to encourage and recruit more therapists into the system and ensure that a framework is built around therapists who are at the coalface.  We must ensure they are doing the job they are employed to do in the first instance and that therapies are being provided to children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  Like every other Member of the House, I have parents contacting me who are trying to get assessments of need for a whole variety of reasons.  We must ensure special needs assistants, SNAs, are in place in primary and secondary schools.  There are challenges getting SNAs even when it is obvious that children have additional needs.  Schools have sought exceptional reviews on a number of occasions, but the Department comes back and says they never applied at all.  We must examine whether the portal is fit for purpose.  I am aware of a school where the staff are very dedicated and hardworking and are trying to do the best for children in all circumstances but they got a kick from the Department of Education.  I know we are talking about disabilities and health funding, but it is about people with disabilities and those with exceptional needs and additional needs.  It is quite clear that the school has made the application and the courteous response from the Department would be to acknowledge that and to say it has not acted upon it and to do so immediately rather than giving a ham-fisted or ridiculous excuse.  Those are the challenges out there.<\/p>  <p>  People with lived experience of disabilities, especially parents, have spent their lives fighting the system in every way, shape and form to try to make sure their relatives have the best possible outcome.  We meet them on a weekly basis in the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  Parents come in and talk about the battles they have fought for 40 or 50 years.  We can see their commitment.  In so doing, they have made it better for others, but it is not their responsibility to be constantly fighting; the State and the Departments must be there, ahead of the curve.  They must understand.  They have a pile of research, and they must be ahead of the curve and make sure that disabilities are being addressed and that there is a response when help is needed by the most vulnerable in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations have been the backbone of the disability delivery services throughout the country in the past 50 to 60 years, since the late 1960s.  They have had an ethos and have worked on a voluntary basis, with boards in place, and were embedded in every community trying to raise funds.  The HSE has undermined the section 39 organisations.  I do not know why that is because the HSE has done nothing to show it is better in any way, shape or form, or that it has a better offer or agenda than the section 39 organisations.  We need to empower the section 39 organisations and stop challenging them and looking for efficiencies and suchlike, as has been going on for a decade.  A lot of the organisations were putting in money at the front for therapies for the people they represent.  We need to empower them rather than challenge them so that they can be the vehicle for the State in making sure we have a better service.<\/p>  <p> On transport, the Departments will come back to say that transport is a huge cost, particularly for the Department of Education, given the challenges that are there.  Many of the schools dealing with the Department will talk of a broken system and there are cases going to the High Court that should never be seen in the High Court.  I welcome the Bill and I know the Minister of State has huge energy and is fighting as hard as she can, and I applaud her for what she is doing and how she is applying herself to the job.  However, this is step one in trying to make sure that, in the years to come, we can say this was a major policy decision to move it from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and that then saw a sea change in care by the State of people with disabilities into the future.  This has to be seen as step one of a massive volume of work that needs to be done by all of us to have a better system in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000036#MM00200","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644503700,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The Bill makes the HSE accountable to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for the management of delivery of the specialist community-based disability services and the development of a service plan, a corporate plan and capital plans.  I hope this is not just about rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.  The focus should be on improving disability services.  In my opinion, the Act on its own will deliver nothing on the ground.  What the people are asking is what it means to the hundreds of thousands who are directly affected by a severe lack of facilities in our communities.  People who are struggling to get assessments and services want to see real, fundamental change in how people who need the services are able to access those services.  What is needed is massive investment in those services that are now passing to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  For example, what change will this bring about for the thousands of children who are waiting on ASD services?  The wait is so long that many age out or get just one or two sessions.  They are four or four and a half years of age, they get one or two sessions and then they age out at five years of age.  They then go from early intervention onto the school age team, and I know this personally because I have been involved in school completion for many years.  Talk about knocking people&rsquo;s heads off a brick wall.  There is a deep frustration that parents feel when they have to go back on another waiting list.  The team is massively under-resourced.  I met the disability services manager a while back.  They have 120 people in places and another 120 on the waiting list, and they can only take in about ten or 15 a year.  There is massive under-resourcing.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to dyslexia and the lack of specialist schools for children to enable them to get the support they need to help them to flourish and grow in mainstream schools, short-term intervention can make a lifelong difference.  There must be co-ordination between health and education services to ensure children get the supports they need.<\/p>  <p>  Danu Community Special School in Dublin 15 has been calling for an onsite therapist.  Under progressing disability services, unfortunately it has not been awarded one.  I am sorry the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is not present because both he and I visited the school just before Christmas and we saw the amazing work it does.  Unfortunately, it is desperately in need of a therapist onsite to work with it.  It is really struggling to deal with the difficulties it has within the school.  If there is one thing I ask the Minister of State to take from today, it is to look at the services at Danu school and to try to get a therapist there.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the provision for a review after three years.  I hope we do that review well within that three-year period because there is a dire need for a comprehensive overview of exactly where we need to be in the delivery of services for children with disabilities.

There is a consensus that it will be supported and that disability services need to be reformed.  The question is whether it will improve services for those who are in the disability services, their families and all of the workers who provide this very important service.  The question is whether it makes the service better because it is reporting to two Ministers, given it has gone from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, or that is my understanding and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong on that.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, this is about improving services in regard to disability, intervention and resources.  Last year, a community-based service, St. John of God&rsquo;s, was in serious difficulty; in fact, it was in so much difficulty there was talk of the liquidation of the service.  I used to work with St. John of God&rsquo;s a long time ago.  It is a great service that provides a community-based service and a day service.  My former workmates were very concerned and are still concerned about the future of St. John of God&rsquo;s because there was an enormous deficit of up to &euro;35 million.  The service cannot be run if it is constantly having to think about deficits &ndash; it just cannot have that.  People cannot run a service when they are talking about liquidation and not being able to fund the service.  That has to be addressed in a serious way.  When we talk about public health in regard to community-based services, I have an issue as to why it is kind of NGOed out.  I do not understand that.  Even though St. John of God&rsquo;s, Stewarts and all of those services provide an amazing service, they should not have a situation where funding is a serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  Community-based disability services have a chequered history in this country.  People were institutionalised, marginalised and stigmatised.  Gladly, we have moved on.  It is not perfect by any means but services have got better and people have gone from that kind of institutionalised setting to a more community-based setting and they have rights.  For a long time, people with disabilities were marginalised.  They faced poverty, deprivation and unemployment, and they were completely marginalised.  That has improved, although it is not perfect by any means.  Hopefully, this new formalisation will mean things improve for everybody, not only those who are living with a disability but also their families and the workers who provide a very good service.<\/p>  <p>  At the heart of disability is that somebody should not be handicapped by that term and they should have a fulfilled life, like anybody else.  That is what this holistic approach is about.  Anybody could be in this situation.  We want to improve life for those with a disability in regard to all of the things which we sometimes take for granted.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Minister of State the best in regard to this new arrangement.  It is not perfect by any means.  I could go on about assessment of needs and the horror stories around that, where people have to approach Deputies.  As I said to the Minister of State before, if families and parents are approaching Deputies, we know there is something really wrong because we are the last people they should be talking to.  I wish the Minister of State the best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000037#NN00300","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1644503700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the work she is doing, which is very challenging.<\/p> <p>Approximately 14 or 15 years ago, I suggested that disability and that type of continuing care and support for people, which is not about curing an illness but about affording people with an ongoing condition a good quality of life, should be separated from acute medicine.  It was my belief that when the argument came around the table regarding the money, the Minister for Health was in an invidious situation trying to argue on the one hand for acute medicine, which often gets a high profile in the media, and, on the other, for disability.  I really welcome that 14 or 15 years later this decision has been taken and that the Minister of State has been put in the hot seat because she has the energy and commitment to make things happen.  It is true that, not only in this country but all over the world, people were put in institutions.  Thankfully that has changed and our attitude towards disability has moved forward.  We still have a long way to go so we need to look forward to a change and an advocate.<\/p> <p> It is important to have good structures but good structures without good Ministers do not, of their own accord, deliver anything.  I do not believe in the idea that everybody is the same and that the service is the same no matter who is driving it.  If I look around the world at everything from sport to medicine, politics or any other activity, people often make the difference, not the structures.  Good structures help good people to make a difference.  No matter how Ministries are divided up, there will be huge cross-cutting challenges.  It is important that the Cabinet is collegiate and that it fights against the tendency of Departments that all of us who ever served in Government are aware of.  At times they run the Departments as if they were fiefdoms in competition against each other, rather than one seamless part of a totality that is there with one aim in mind, namely the common good.  One former Minister for Health stands out for me on disability and that was Brian Cowen.  Things moved forward at that time but in the past ten years disability has not been high on the agenda and we need to change that.<\/p> <p> I join with those who have raised the issues with section 39 funding.  I cannot understand why sections 38 and 39 are different.  That would be a quick win if the Minister of State could make sure that equal work gets equal wages.  That is important for structures and it is important that equal bodies do equal work and get equal money to buy services.  I mentioned the issue of accommodation to the Minister of State last night.  In the past accommodation was simple.  It was in congregated settings and it was provided by the HSE.  In the past 20 years we have been decongregating the settings and that was a great thing and something I welcome.  In doing that, we have not really decided how we will fund them.  We have been using capital assistance scheme funding from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the various disability organisations realised they could tap into.  However, this funding was never structured to deal with disability.  For example, on the one hand an organisation might get the standard amount of CAS funding for a house and, on the other, it has to comply with HIQA standards for the buildings.  HIQA standards are much higher than the standards any of us would apply to our private domestic dwellings.  I will leave it to the Minister of State to crack this one but between the Departments of Health, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is important that a dedicated and agreed process on accommodation in community settings is agreed.  We need to make sure that houses as near as can be to the way the rest of us live are provided.  The money should be in a ring-fenced fund and the specifications for that funding should match the requirement for the quality of the building because I have seen some fantastic examples of what can be done.  There is one particular development in Galway city and some day the two of us will go and look at it if the Minister of State has not seen it already.  Each apartment is individual and there are good community spaces.  It is ideal because it caters for people who have significant disabilities on the one hand and it also provides for their individuality on the other.  It does not have the appearance of a regimental system that does not allow for individual flair.<\/p> <p> I only have 30 seconds left but I could talk on this subject for a long time because it is something I am hugely committed to and interested in.  We need to move much more promptly on early intervention and therapies.  Supporting therapies for people with disabilities are hard to get so we need to move on that.  No matter what our political shade is, all of us in this House will say it is cruel and hard on parents, who might already have children with significant disabilities, that they spend so much of their lives advocating for basic rights and services.  I have no doubt that if there is anybody in this House who might be able to tackle all that it is the Minister of State, and it is a huge workload.  She can make headway in whatever time this Government lasts, and it is due to last three and a half years.  I hope she will manage to make significant progress in laying the bedrock for a much brighter future for people with disabilities in that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000037#NN00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644504300,"counter":437,"content":"<p>This is a technical Bill and I acknowledge the commitment and hard work the Minister of State puts into her brief.  I know she shows huge empathy with the people she works with.  That said, I cannot see this Bill making a huge difference, or any difference, to neurodiverse children who are being bused out of their communities with strangers.  More than &euro;70,000 per day is being spent in south Dublin alone to transport autistic children out of their communities in this way.  That is just south Dublin and it would be interesting to know what the entire national figure is.  A freedom of information request went in and it was established that &euro;72,000 per day was spent transporting children to classes outside of their communities each day.  How can this be justified?  How will this Bill change that waste?  Why can neurodiverse children not have the expectation that they will be able to walk to school with their brothers and sisters?<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will not make any difference to the parents in south Dublin who cannot get a place in the same school as their other siblings.  Despite a 37-day process, schools in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W have not opened any new classes.  A relatively new school in Sandymount, the Shellybanks Educate Together National School, has not opened a new class even though it has the space within that footprint.  Earlier this week I was talking to one parent who was in tears in the middle of the street telling me about the fear and desperation their family had when they were told there was no place for their child in a class in September.  This worry and fear is all-consuming for the family and it is crippling them.  It is not a debate for today but no school should be allowed to open without having an autism class and that goes for primary and secondary schools.  This Bill will not make any difference to the parents who are waiting years to have their children assessed.<\/p> <p>If the Bill could make a difference to service provision then parents of neurodiverse children would be delighted but it is hard to see how shuffling arounde the chairs will make a difference to children with autism and their parents.  It is a real challenge for them and spending so much transporting children out of their communities is no way to treat them and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000038#OO00200","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644504900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  I have spoken many times in this House on mental health and in particular, the mental health of our younger generation.  The younger generation of today faces many challenges and mental health is one of the main ones.  I welcome this Bill and hope that by transferring certain functions to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, it will improve the provision of mental health services to our younger generation.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, statistics do not lie.  The latest figures show that more than 2,500 children and young people are waiting for CAMHS.  What is even more alarming is that almost 9,000 children are waiting for primary care psychology treatment.  In addition, more than 1,500 adults are waiting on primary care psychology treatment from the HSE.  These figures are truly shocking and unacceptable.  In this day and age, we should not have any child or young adult waiting on mental health services because the dangers are just too great. <\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organization, WHO, states that a minimum of 14% of a country&rsquo;s overall health budget should be allocated to mental health services.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that the mental health budget should be a minimum of 10% of the overall health budget but the latest Government figures show that only 5.2% of the overall health budget was allocated to mental health.  To put this in perspective, our mental health budget is nearly two thirds less than the minimum recommended by the WHO.  The Mental Health Commission told the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that Ireland's mental health system is not fit for purpose, is out of date and substantial additional investment is needed.  This is a serious issue and one that the Government needs to address as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the Covid pandemic, waiting lists for mental health services were at crisis levels.  Now that we are coming out of this pandemic, I fear that those waiting lists have gotten even worse.  I call on the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to tackle this problem immediately. <\/p>  <p>  Time and time again we hear the Government talk about the challenges of tackling mental health and the many actions it is taking to deal with the issue.  The bottom line is that not enough is being done to tackle mental health problems, particularly among our younger generation.  The Government needs to take this seriously and invest more resources so that more than 2,500 children are no longer waiting for access to CAMHS.  We need to dramatically reduce the number of children waiting on primary care psychology treatment.  At present, almost 9,000 children are waiting for such treatment and this is unacceptable. <\/p>  <p>  In my role as a Deputy and through my involvement in the GAA, I see at the first-hand the challenges faced by the younger generation in particular.  I also see that mental health issues in this generation are getting worse.  We cannot have a situation where we are constantly dealing with these issues too late.  We need to address mental health issues at a very early age.  We need to teach children in primary school that mental health issues and challenges will occur in their lives and that there are ways and means to deal with them.  Children must be taught how to deal with the many challenges that they will face in life.  Stress, anxiety, and fear among our younger generation are growing all the time and we must put systems and supports in place to enable them to deal with these challenges.  The stigma attached to mental health issues must be removed.  It is okay to say that you need help or that you cannot cope.  These are not weak but strong actions to take.  The younger generation must be supported in these challenging times.  The bottom line is that if we can provide this generation with the proper supports and systems, they will support each other.  When a friend is struggling, it is very important that people rally round and support each other.  Often when teenagers are feeling under stress they turn to their peers for support.  This is where education and a proper understanding of mental health issues will really help.  As I have said, the figures for mental health are truly shocking.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to acknowledge that we have a crisis on our hands and to commit to ensuring that proper and adequate funding and resources are allocated to mental health issues.  It is disgraceful that only 5.2% of our annual health budget is allocated to mental health services when the WHO recommends a minimum of 14%.<\/p>  <p>  This time last week I spoke to the Minister of State the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, and to staff in her Department about a very serious case involving a 14 year old girl in Dundalk.  In fairness to them, they contacted the girl's mother and they tried their best to help.  The child did see a psychologist and she spoke to CAMHS staff, including a social worker and the team leader.  They are all trying their best but the child has said that she wants to commit suicide.  At present, the child is at home with her mother and three other siblings but that is not the right place for her.  I contacted the Department and explained that this child is banging her head against the wall and is looking for help.  Are we going to keep passing the buck?  This child is crying out for help.  The psychiatrist told the child to come back in one week but her mother cannot take any more stress.  She cannot take it any more.  She has three other children at home and she is trying her best.  <\/p>  <p>  I was told that I must be very careful in what I say and do.  The only place I seem to be able to say what I want to say is in the Chamber, thanks to parliamentary privilege.  If I go on my local radio station or to my local newspaper, it is me they will come after and, in fairness, I cannot put that on my family.  Do I have to come in here every week and keep raising the same issues?  I have the contact details of this child and I will pass them on to the Minister of State.  I am not trying to pass the buck to anybody but the child is crying and is looking for help.  Her parents are looking for help but everyone seems to be passing the buck and that is not fair.  We are talking here about a 14 year old child.  Her mother took her phone from her and she locks her in her room.  When she went to check on her last week, her face was all cut.  She is crying out for help.  I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to help last week and I am asking the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, this week.  Do I have ask the Taoiseach next week?  Do I have to ask the T&aacute;naiste the week after that?  I am not saying that this girl could commit suicide and could be dead next week but I am crying out for help here.  If she goes to see professional people but they do not listen to her or to her mother, what is the point of that?  When she went to see the psychiatrist, he did not even check if she had any marks on her body.  He just asked her some questions.  She said to him, \"I don't want to be here\", but then she said that she wanted to be helped.  She is very conflicted.  <\/p>  <p>  When I am finished speaking I will send the details that I sent to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, last week to the Minister of State.  I do not care who gets involved or what is involved.  All I want to know is that we can help this girl.  If we can save one life, it will be well worth it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000039#PP00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1644504900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which provides for a transfer of functions.  I welcome the Bill and support it.  However, like other speakers, I am worried about what happens when it is passed.  The most important issue with regard to disabilities is funding.  Responsibilities going from one Department to another is fine but the funding needs to follow the service.  I also have concerns about the HSE still retaining some clout in this area, although that may be for very good reasons.<\/p>  <p>  I am member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, as is Deputy Hourigan, and the Chairman of that committee spoke earlier.  We have been engaging with people with disabilities, advocates and representative groups for the past 18 months.  Some of the stories we have heard have been pretty traumatic.  There is a serious concern among parents as to what will happen to their son or daughter when they pass away.  That concern starts when a child is born who is found to have special needs.  <\/p> <p>Early intervention seems to be very haphazard.  The parents start a journey where they are fighting and they are in a battle from that day on.  There is no clear pathway where they see a plan formulated or have a caseworker with them for the entire journey in order that they know what to expect, what will happen next and how it will happen.  We have reconfigured some of these services in our region in Galway but we are now being told that we need to give it time to bed in.  That is no good to families whose children need interventions.  We need to make sure that there is a clear pathway.  <br\/><br\/>Today, the committee was talking about the other end of the spectrum, namely education and employment.  There is a huge learning curve for us all.  Maybe our generation is not as well up as the younger generation.  People with disabilities, insofar as possible, should be educated in mainstream schools so that people who do not have disabilities are able to grow up with them and understand them and it becomes a norm.  Employers are cautious about taking on people.  There can be a fear factor around what they are taking on.  We have to take that away from people and make sure that when employers are hiring that there is a quota.  We can start ourselves in the public service.  In my time as a lecturer in GMIT, I have experience of people with disabilities and getting third-level education, getting their level 8 degrees and going on to full-time employment, becoming a beacon of light and hope.  We need to see a lot more of that so that parents can have some reassurance that their child will grow up and be able to fend for themselves financially.<br\/><br\/>Personalised budgets is a very important area.  The Indecon report showed that the cost of living with a disability is between &euro;9,500 and &euro;12,000 more than the cost of normal living.  We need to make sure that when we bring in schemes that they are adaptable and flexible to deal with the specific needs of the person who needs them.  We see that with the housing adaptation and mobility grants that are administered by the local authorities.  They are great grants and schemes but they are only contributions.  It is the same sum regardless of the type or severity of disability.  The budgets need to be addressed towards the personal needs of the person who needs it.<br\/><br\/>We often talk about disability and maybe in the past we were playing lip service but I think the Minister of State, with our support, will make sure that it gets beyond that.  Sometimes I feel that it is just a box being ticked to make sure that things are right.  We have also created a great deal of mystery of how the pathway should be for a child or adult when moving services.  <br\/><br\/>I must also raise transportation supports for people with disabilities.  There is effectively no scheme to support people with disabilities because the primary medical certificate scheme has been deemed unfit for purpose.  The courts concluded that almost two years ago.  Instead of fixing the issue the Department of Finance, in its wisdom, adjusted the criteria to suit something else.  Now the appeals board has resigned <i>en masse<\/i>because it cannot work with it.  There it is left.  Whether it is the Department of Finance or Health, everyone is saying that it is somebody else's responsibility.  I think it is our responsibility.  We should not entertain leaving these people without proper supports for transportation.  Something that is thrown at me and the Minister of State, who comes from the same constituency will understand this well, is that we are working on providing public transport that people with disabilities cannot access.  However, there are a hell of a lot of places that I know of in our constituencies where there is no public transport, let alone a bus with wheelchair access.  Let us cut to the chase.  The mobility grants and the transportation support grants are gone.  People are not getting that support; they are getting absolutely nothing.  While people who did qualify for it are being supported we have created an unequal society.  The retiring Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall's latest report before Christmas, was called Grounded.  He did not call it that for any reason except that there is a huge number of people with disabilities who are grounded in this country because we do not give them the supports that they need.  We have been talking about this a good while.  It is important that we get on with it.<br\/><br\/>Thinking of all the money that goes to health, we need to see the disability budget being transparent around what it is going to do, who will be responsible for spending it and who will be responsible for delivering the services.  That is what this Bill is supposed to do.  I will support the Minister of State on this and I hope she will keep in mind that we do not want a plethora of laws and so on and then for things to start happening in three or four years.  The Bill has taken 18 months to get here.  It cannot take another 18 months or for people saying it needs time to bed in.  That phrase needs to be removed from the agenda for the sake of the people with disabilities.  <br\/><br\/>In respite for families of children parents and families still do not have what they deserve.  It is important that we provide overnight respite services that are accessible to people so that we do not have people travelling from Galway to Limerick to get respite care overnight where they have to bring the child down and pick them up again the next day.  That is not respite.  That is actually hardship upon hardship and anguish.<br\/><br\/>I wish the Minister of State well in getting the Bill across the line.  I do not know how many times I have said it at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters that after talking to people, we, as politicians, feel after that we are inadequate because we are not actually making the difference.  We all come across things in our clinics and constituencies that we as politicians should not, and cannot, be proud of.  Much of it comes down to a case where we have just told people with disabilities, &quot;Yeah, you'll be okay&quot;.  That is not the fault of the Minister of State, of course, but we need to make sure that while we are at it, and the committee will help with this, we will make a tangible difference to people who have disabilities.  It is most important that when we finish with this legislation that then we get on with the real job.  If there is any kind of monkey business going on in the Department of Health, we have to call it for what it is.  We need people with disabilities to be served properly, in a way to which they are entitled under the UN convention.  It is important that we embed that in everyone's minds, not simply in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000039#PP00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644505500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I have listened to some scepticism regarding the import of the Bill but I am quite hopeful that the transfer of the disability portfolio to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be effective and worthwhile.  As we move towards a rights-based approach to addressing the requirements of persons with disabilities and the provision of services around that, this new context for policy and legislation will be quite important.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she has an excellent approach to her brief and I can see her working incredibly hard to meet the challenges that the sector faces.  I believe that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will support her well in that.  Deputy Canney mentioned the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which is tasked with overseeing the UNCRPD, can assist the Minister of State in this.  I have learned in the few years that I have been here that there genuinely is a cohort of Oireachtas Members who are totally committed to the issue.  I can reflect on Deputy Canney's feeling of inadequacy when hearing of the lived experience of people but that is not down to a lack of commitment because there is serious commitment from Members on both sides of the House.<\/p> <p>However, I take the opportunity to situate the policy work we have to do in the next few years in the lived experience of persons with disabilities and their families.  Especially as we are moving to this new context, we should be thinking of it in the context of financial independence and inclusion for those with disabilities.<\/p> <p> We have heard lots of numbers this afternoon, but the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures from 2017 suggest there are more than 130,000 persons with disabilities who are living in danger of consistent poverty.  In the past two years, Covid-19 has had a specific effect on persons with disabilities.  It has been incredibly hard on some people, and we must factor that into our plans for the next few years.  We could also see Covid-19 as an opportunity to put persons with disabilities and their rights at the very centre of action and direct funding to support accessible and inclusive communities.  We have all realised in the past two years how much we rely on our communities.  It is important measures are strengthened to support persons with disabilities to transition out of and prevent them from falling into poverty.  I am saying that with particular reference to the level of inflation we are seeing at the moment.  Levels of poverty inevitably interact with other components of our family and community life.  We know only 30% of persons with disabilities are in paid work, and for persons with visual impairment it is only 24%.  In general, our numbers of persons in employment from the disability community are around 20% lower than the EU average.  That is a stark number.<\/p> <p> We know persons with disability consistently struggle to find suitable and secure housing and some people wait for five to ten years for State-provided housing.  The housing situation for persons with disabilities is of course just a crisis within a crisis, that being the broader housing crisis, but it demonstrates a housing sector that is not really working for persons with disabilities.  There are huge levels of uncaptured need on top of this because there are many young persons with disabilities who are living with parents, who would not necessarily be captured within those numbers, who have no prospect of moving out and living independently or who are living with elderly carers.  A core problem there is access to the HSE support package.<\/p> <p> I could continue highlighting those issues through education, health and mental health.  As we are doing this changeover, it is important to recognise the history of persons with disabilities in this State has been one of poverty and social exclusion.  That is a legacy that is very important for us as parliamentarians and especially parliamentarians on the Government side to recognise.  On average, as other Deputies have said, other EU countries spend about 2% of their GDP on social protection for disability and Ireland has in the past spent far less than this.  The disability capacity review gives some indication of the level of investment that will be required, and those numbers are considerable.  To make the changes we need for persons with disabilities, we will not only need to be ambitious but also very diligent and comprehensive.  I welcome the proposed Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021, which would include measures to further realise the UNCRPD in Ireland, including, and very importantly, legislating for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to be a national monitoring body for the convention.  That is an important move.  We are going to need serious oversight to keep ourselves honest because it is incredibly complex and sits across several Departments.<\/p> <p> Returning to the idea of seeing through the lens of disability, poverty is a relentless and hungry opponent for many people.  It can steal their energy, ambition, hope and make every task, every goal and every day feel like a Herculean undertaking.  It is the mandate of this Government and of everybody in the House, because so many people care genuinely about this, to ease that burden for persons with disabilities.  The short version of what I wanted to flag in this debate is I am asking that this change be a kind of mandate to reach out, not just to the various representative groups of persons with disabilities, the service providers and the individuals themselves who experience disability but for us in this House to reach out to Departments.<\/p> <p> Issues around disability reside in the Department with responsibility for housing, and here I reference the Irish Wheelchair Association's call for a change to building regulations and access.  They reside in the Department of Social Protection, as with what we just heard from Deputy Canney about the request for the &euro;20 recognition of poverty payment, which has been highlighted by the Disability Federation of Ireland.  The issues reside in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, where there is a need for equality budgeting and well-being indicators that would be so important for persons with disabilities as a means of going beyond the traditional metrics of GDP.  It would be a way of measuring progress and assisting in reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights for marginalised groups, of which persons with disabilities are one.  It must also reside in the Department of the Taoiseach, where major nation-building decisions are made, such as the creation of the national development plan, on which the Committee on Disability Matters made a submission.  In addition there is the Department with responsibility for employment which has a role when we talk about sections 38 and 39 organisations.<\/p> <p> I can think of few parliamentarians better suited to the task of reaching out beyond the boundaries of their brief and making their influence felt in all sorts of decisions from other Departments than the Minister of State.  I wish her well and look forward to supporting her in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000040#QQ00200","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644506100,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I am glad to see the Minister of State here and that she is responsible for this area.  She seems to be responsible for everything because she seems to be the only Minister or Minster of State I see in Parliament taking anything and everything that is going.  Fair play to her.  If one positive comes out of this legislation, it is probably that the Minister of State is the one who is responsible for it, because she will actually make something of it.  That is the weakness of it as well.  We must rely on people like her to ensure this will work.  The danger is that if she moves on, through a change of Government, promotion or whatever, this will fall down again.  That is the problem.  It is the problem with everything.  Other Members have highlighted that disability matters have homes in so many different Departments.  Trying to get one Department to do something is bad enough but when you have two, three or four Departments with responsibility, you may forget about it.  That is the reality.  Even though we bring in legislation here and this Bill is good on paper and looks good, I have serious doubts about how it will operate in reality.  That is the real problem we all face.  Somehow, we must face up to it and deal with it.  I do not know what the solution is yet.  If I get that knowledge, I will let the Minister of State know.<\/p>  <p>  I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I understand it will amend the Health Act 2004, the Disability Act 2005 and the Health Act 2007 to transfer policy, functions and funding responsibility relating to specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Bill will also provide for consultation in joint functions of the Ministers to provide for revised corporate governance and accountability arrangements of the HSE.  Seeing how that operates will be interesting in itself.  There is definitely something badly wrong with the HSE as an organisation and I do not know how that is going to be addressed.  I appreciate this transfer makes sense on paper.  However, I note that responsibility for the delivery of specialist community-based disability services would be retained within the Health Service Executive following the transfer.  This would mean the HSE would be expected to report to two Ministers about different aspects of its functions.  I am sceptical of how this will work.  The HSE fails in being accountable to one Minister.  What makes us think it would properly accountable to two?  That is a real problem.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is aware of this and I will speak a wee bit more later on about our own interactions on the Brandon report and how that shows up what is wrong with the HSE.  That is the crux of the problem.  Unless we deal with the HSE, by kicking it up the arse or kicking it out the door and getting something else in place, then we are on a hiding to nothing from here on in.  I often think if you were an alien coming down to look at Ireland, you would think it a great country if all you could see was the legislation we had.  You would think this was a great place with great legislation.  It says everything and does everything and it is on the box.  However, if you looked at the implementation you would say this is a completely different country and ask how this could be.  That is the crux of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, a very recent example of this is the Brandon report, which details multiple incidents of sexual abuse that took place at Ard na Gr&eacute;ine in Stranorlar, County Donegal.  The National Independent Review Panel was commissioned to carry out the report, which was then submitted to the HSE in 2020.  When the Minister of State asked for a copy of this report in 2020, she was told this was not possible and that she would get it in due course.<\/p> <p>When the HSE provided the Minister of State with a list of recommendations stemming from the Brandon report in April 2021, to ensure the recommendations were appropriate, she again asked for a copy of the report and was again refused.  Following this, she continued to request a copy of the report.  However, the HSE was not forthcoming and at one point thought it would be enough just to show the report to her on a screen, as far as I know.  The HSE did the same thing to me in respect of a different report that had no bearing on the Brandon report.  I will take this opportunity to commend the Minister of State, as I am certain this report would not have been given to her Department if it were not for her persistence.  That is a tribute to her and the work she did to make sure it happened, which is vitally important.  This issue will go on for a while yet and will be important to how the HSE does its business.<\/p> <p> I hope this persistence continues; I know that with the Minister of State in place it will.  Despite what we have been told, the families do want this report published.  That is vitally important.  The HSE is saying they do not, but the families do.  I know that for a fact because I have talked to many of these families regarding this.  I also know that some families, whose loved ones were involved in the Brandon report, have not been even contacted by the HSE, despite what it says.  This is part of the weaknesses.  We have had to rely on the HSE to do much of this, including contacting the families, telling the truth and so on.  We are relying on the HSE to do the right thing but it has not.  That is shocking, even at this stage, when things have been going on for so long.<\/p> <p> It leads us to ask how we will know the HSE will do the right thing in future.  The instance of the Brandon report is very important, and there may be less important matters, but it shows how difficult it is for us in this House to ensure the HSE will be accountable in future?  The fact that the HSE refused outright to report to a Minister of State is incredibly concerning.  It is supposedly a State agency, yet this shows it is not truly answerable to the Minister of State.  It makes one wonder who is really calling the shots and why the HSE has been given the power to do this.  The HSE has probably gained this power of pottering on and doing its own thing over the years, but it seems it is not accountable to anybody and can do what it wants.  That is very concerning.  It begs the question how it will be possible for the HSE  to be accountable to two Ministers, when it so obviously and openly fails to be accountable to one.  This is something that seriously needs to be looked at.  These agencies need to be accountable to the Minister who oversees them, otherwise what is the point of that Minister?  What is the point of elected representatives, such as us, when our institutions are not even answerable to us?  This is a serious matter and it should not be overlooked or brushed under the carpet.  I would like to see this investigated further because it is very necessary. <\/p> <p> I am wary of Bills such as this that provide for certain functions to be covered by two Departments.  While the technical aspect may appear to be an effective distribution of regulation and oversight, I have concerns about how this will be carried out in practice.  As I said earlier, in this country, whatever hope you have with one Department, it is very limited with two, non-existent with three and good luck to you with four because it is just a waste of time.  That indicates something is badly wrong with our system of government and about accountability to the House.  As I said, I do not know exactly how we can resolve that, but a good step would be to make people accountable, whether they like it or not.  We are accountable every five years and we can lose our jobs straightaway, but what head of the HSE, or person in one of its sections, or in Departments, would lose their jobs for blatantly doing things wrong, for punishing people, not dealing with families in a fair and safe manner, not informing families about how their loved ones are being treated and so on?  These are very serious issues that need to be dealt with and unless this legislation can deal with them somewhere along the line we will be at a loss, despite the good words of the Minister of State.<\/p> <p> Like other Deputies who have spoken on this Bill, I would like further clarity on the practical issues that may arise from this, particularly the accountability arrangements of the HSE and how the budget will be set.  I am cautious in my support of this Bill.  Although I believe it makes sense on paper, I wonder how this may be put into practice.  I would like to see my concerns taken on board and addressed, as I believe there have been real flaws in how inter-departmental issues have been addressed in the past.  This needs to change in order to properly facilitate the future transitioning of powers from one Minister to another.  I would also like to see the accountability issues between the HSE and Ministers addressed.  I hope this will be addressed by the Minister of State and that these issues may be discussed on Committee Stage and as the Bill progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000041#RR00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644506700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who has contributed this evening.  I will split my time in two.  I will deal with the legislative side of the Bill, in addition to some of the issues that were brought up, in answer to some of the questions.  Deputy Smith asked a number of very important questions regarding how it will all work and whether everyone in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have to go back to the Department of Health with the begging cap to ask it for approval and so on.  \"No\" is the answer to that.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will deal directly with all budgetary matters with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath.  That is the way it will be set out.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill recognises the enormous importance of both Departments working together.  This is the key theme throughout the Bill.  The HSE will report to both Ministers, but it will do so via one service plan, one capital plan and one corporate plan.  This will minimise any silos.  The Bill also provides for two Ministers to enter into arrangements for embedded co-operation.  This will happen, specifically, on the budget.  No Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will go through the Department of Health.  When the transfer happens, the Minister with responsibility for equality will take over the vote expenditure and negotiate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of budget 2023.  That is an important piece of it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall's question was around fears about moving the significant budget.  She also talked about the sectoral plan in the context of section 51 of the Bill.  The transfer is about a technical exercise and moving policy responsibility between Departments that is turning a page and allowing a fresh focus on this area.  The scale of disability that will be related to the new Department means disability will take centre stage.  Deputy Moynihan called disability the Cinderella of the Department of Health.  It will now get the opportunity to flourish, grow and support people with disabilities and their families.  The Bill is a step in the right direction and a very welcome one.  The Disability Act 2005 already requires the Minister for Transport to create a sectorial plan.  This Bill amends the 2005 Act to allow a transfer of certain responsibilities, but does not alter or weaken any existing requirements on sectorial plans.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the contributions focused on service delivery.  We acknowledge that it is a very technical Bill, but it is important that I reassure all the Deputes, and especially people listening in, that I have been doing the job for the past 18 months.  I thank the Taoiseach for his foresight in making this decision, but when I arrived and he told me I was taking over as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, I was very quickly not on the welcoming email in the Department of Health.  Thanks to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, I got an office in his Department, so I was out of the gap straightaway on 1 July.  I never functioned within the Department of Health; I have always functioned with the equality hat, along with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  That is not to say I have not had a great working relationship with the Minister for Health and the team in that Department, but I have based myself where I was always going to end up.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted it did not all happen on day one because I have learned so much in the past 18 months, including where the pitfalls are.  That is something that Deputy Smith asked - where are the problems?  The problems are in the integrated piece in primary care and what will happen with aids and appliances.  That is what we are working out at present.  The memorandum of understanding is that if the two Ministers do not get on, what will happen?  As Deputy Shortall said, who will be the referee?  That is where the Taoiseach and the Cabinet will have to work it out.<\/p>  <p>  I am very fortunate that since becoming Minister of State I have worked with everybody, including the Department of Health, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, on the disability housing strategy - we have done that in the past number of weeks - and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, on the ability programme to address employment.  In respect of education, I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, and the Minister of State, Josepha Madigan, in the Department of Education on transition planning.  I am working with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, on higher education to ensure more students are taken onto the various course to meet therapy requirements, and with the T&aacute;naiste on enterprise and entrepreneurship.  Some 80% of all disabilities are acquired when a person is over 18; those people are not born with a disability.  People have to change their focus.  We have to look at enterprise and entrepreneurship and I acknowledge the role of Professor Cooney in Dublin City University on that.<\/p> <p> We also have to talk about transport.  Many of us here are from rural areas, where we do not have access to the DART or the Luas.  We have to look at various areas in regard to transport.  In recent weeks, I have reconvened the transport team, which has not met since 2017.  I have brought all of them back around the table.  I am looking at what worked in the past.  The issue of allowances was mentioned.  Allowances were cut, removed and so on.  It is all back on the table.<\/p> <p> On expenditure, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has given me approximately &euro;250 million in the past 18 months to ensure I can do the job within disabilities.  Sometimes it is not all just about the money.  There is a staffing issue at this time.  If I could fill the vacant posts, the children's disability network teams would have a far different experience than what we are hearing about this evening.<\/p> <p> The status of the disability capacity review under way in the Department of Health was raised.  The framework and action plan on that is being put together.  It is about putting the meat on the bones, which is bringing the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform into the room.  We know the unmet need.  It is now about calculating how much money I need and how much that Department will give me.  On the issue of under-65s in nursing homes, while we had only a token allocation in budget 2021, it will be cranked up in budget 2022.  On the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, the comprehensive employment strategy and the national disability strategy on housing, both are under my remit and I chair both.  I keep on top of that.<\/p> <p> I am not the Minister of good intentions; I am the Minister of action.  I have the money and I want to deliver.  Reference was made to \"my intentions\".  I am action-based.  I am fortunate that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is a legislative individual because he will be taking over that side of things and I will be getting into the nuts and bolts of putting the practical steps in place.  Much of what we are talking about here today is about getting into the HSE and the nuts and bolts of putting in place the network disability teams.  Every team works differently and there are 91 teams.  What we need is a standard operating procedure in regard to, for example, how a child comes in, the pathway through, how many children are looked after and how many have been seen at the end of the week.  It is about key performance indicators, accountability and delivery of service.  That is what I am looking for in that regard.<\/p> <p> It was stated there is dragging of feet.  There is nobody within the Department of Health or the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or any of my colleagues dragging their feet.  Work is under way on the legislation on the decision support services and we are engaged in this transfer of function.  All the while, we are also ensuring essential services are open.  The Irish Sign Language Act will test Departments.  That is a legal requirement.  I worry about that.  On the optional protocol, we are 100% committed to it.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, demonstrated that in his contribution.<\/p> <p> Had this transfer happened on 1 July, I would not have learned how the HSE runs its own process internally.  We learned that from the National Independent Review Panel, NIRP, piece.  For me, it is about the break in culture and the change in the system.  It is also about the powers of the Minister.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 clearly sets out what powers Ministers have and what they can commission.  Where I do see a pattern, and this is the important piece in regard to Brandon, it is incumbent upon me as Minister to call for an independent review, to look at issues through the lens of the social model and at how relationships work with Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, social care and within the HSE such that people can be supported to do their jobs and they have confidence and trust in the system.  I am working on that.  I am speaking about where I see patterns, which I have seen.  I do not need a NIRP to tell me there are issues in Donegal; I know there are issues there.  I am working with the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure we come to a space where we can have that independent piece conducted.<\/p> <p> A lot of work has gone into drafting this Bill.  It is very technical, but when boiled down it is about making the Minister with responsibility for equality equal to the Minister for Health in regard to functions related to community-based disability services, which are complex needs.  That is where the HSE will be answerable to both, but we will work uniformly on everything.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the Bill progressing through Committee Stage.  If I have missed any of the points raised today, I am sure I will be reminded of them as the Bill progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000042#SS00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644507300,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1644507300,"counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1644507300,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Health pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT00400","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644507300,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1644507300,"counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1644507300,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Kathleen Funchion - to discuss an update on the DEIS status of Scoil Mhuire Lourdes girls' school in Tullow, County Carlow; (2) Deputy Barry Cowen - to discuss delays in the provision of work permits; (3) Deputy Niamh Smyth - to discuss a dedicated Huntington's disease clinic in Ireland; (4) Deputy Joe Flaherty - to discuss funding opportunities for Longford's Museum of Music Ireland, MOMI, and the motte project and interpretative centre in Granard; (5) Deputy Martin Kenny - to discuss access to pain management consultants and gynaecological care in the west; (6) Deputy Pat Buckley - to discuss funding for the upgrading of the Carrigtwohill to Midleton corridor of the N25; (7) Deputy Chris Andrews - to discuss the refusal to sanction an improved hospital pharmacy service; (8) Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - to discuss the funding the Government intends to provide for the FAI's Euro 2028 bid; (9) Deputy Joan Collins - to discuss the outsourcing of Tesco contracts to a security company; (10) Deputy Martin Browne - to discuss services for the eating disorder avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; (11) Deputy Marian Harkin - to discuss the issue of rural crime and, in particular, burglary and aggravated assault; (12) Deputy Louise O'Reilly - to discuss the need to renovate and utilise derelict houses owned by the HSE in Portrane, County Dublin; and (13) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss the eligibility of residential properties under the warmer homes scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Funchion, Ellis, Joan Collins and Cowen have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT00700","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1644507300,"counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Status","time":1644507300,"counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1644507300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>My question is in regard to DEIS status for Scoil Mhuire Lourdes, which is a girls' school in Tullow, County Carlow, its application for additional accommodation to expand facilities to support its learning, the reason it does not have an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class and what measures are proposed to rectify this problem.<\/p>  <p>  I had a meeting recently with the principal of this school.  It does not have DEIS status but there is an urgent need for it to be given that status.  I would welcome some feedback from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in regard to how the school should go about securing it.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is familiar with the Tullow area.  It is an area of high deprivation.  It is important that consideration be given to this school being awarded DEIS status.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the ASD class, I was surprised to learn this school wants to have an ASD class.  It should be commended on that, but its application in that regard has not been granted, apparently because it is deemed not to be a need in the area.  There very much is a need in the area for an ASD class.  I will give some details in regard to the school.  There are children within the school from families where one or two of the parents are unemployed, and 33% of the families are headed up by lone parents.  As we know, there are issues of poverty within lone parent families.  It is important to emphasise this is an all-girls school.  Some 35% of the families are being supported by the school completion programme, which is an excellent programme and one I regularly try to speak about in this House.  There is a high level of need within this school.<\/p>  <p>  The principal is an excellent advocate for the school.  She has been pushing hard for all of this and she is really passionate about it.  In regard to the ASD class, in one family where there is a lone parent, one child is attending this school but the other child needs to go to an ASD class and will have to travel outside of Tullow to access it.  During a meeting we had with that lone parent, she made the point that, in terms of climate, the green agenda and people changing their ways in regard to transport, it makes no sense for her child to have to travel by bus to another school because the facilities are not in place in this school to accommodate her child.  It is important we get this right.<\/p>  <p>  The condition of the school is an issue.  DEIS status is also an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000043#TT01000","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1644507900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  My understanding is that more than 800 schools in this country already have DEIS status.  As the Deputy knows, the entire DEIS model is under review at present.  Funding was almost doubled to &euro;32 million in the budget from the &euro;18 million available last year.  That is on top of the &euro;150 million that was given to the Department to make sure there are supports for the DEIS programme.  It is important we look after all children going to school, but disadvantaged children in particular as well as children with additional needs, who fall under my remit.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware Scoil Mhuire Lourdes girls' school has applied for DEIS status and I also understand the technical aspects of the refinement of the identification model is being looked at.  A lot of consultation is ongoing with our education partners, national representative bodies and unions.  It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme because all schools will automatically be considered under the refined model when it is applied.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about additional accommodation.  I am aware there has been an application from that school for additional accommodation under the additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme.  From listening to the Deputy's comments, I imagine that is probably because they are looking for a special class.  I know there are approximately 40 special classes in the general area of Carlow.  In fact, one of those is a new class that opened just this year.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is telling me that, at present, there is sufficient capacity to cater for all children with additional needs.  I agree with the Deputy's comments about commending Scoil Mhuire Lourdes girls' school for wanting to open a special class in the first instance.  It is not always the case, and I am always grateful and welcoming to schools that take the initiative, want to take an inclusive approach to education and have that culture and ethos within the school to welcome all children with additional needs.  I know the application that has been put in to modernise and consider new accommodation is being assessed.  On completion of that assessment process, the school authority will, of course, be contacted directly with a decision.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the minor works grant, which is payable to all primary schools.  It gives schools flexibility in making improvements to the physical infrastructure of school buildings.  There are also enhanced capitation grants that are given to schools, particularly where they open a special class.  Some schools even open two special classes.  They are given grants of &euro;6,500 and &euro;7,000 for furniture and ICT, respectively.  That is important.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned transport in particular.  Education is a right for all children, including those with additional needs.  It is not always possible to provide that education in their own locality, but certainly the NCSE and the Department endeavour to do so.<\/p>  <p>  On school transport, I know there is now an onus on the public sector to provide electric vehicles, so many of the buses will be carbon-free over the next period of time.  There are targets for the green agenda the Deputy mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000044#UU00100","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1644507900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I welcome what the Minister of State has said about additional funding for the DEIS scheme.  That is welcome.  However, it is frustrating for a school that still falls outside the scheme, especially when it relies so much on programmes such as the school completion programme and various other programmes.  I am glad the Minister of State acknowledged the school in question is working to try to be inclusive.  I agree that is what we want our schools to be.  If we are being honest, not all schools take that approach and Scoil Mhuire Lourdes girls' school should be commended on that.  I am glad the Minister of State mentioned that.<\/p>  <p>  Could we get some information from the NCSE?  It says it feels there is an adequate level of special classes in the area but Scoil Mhuire Lourdes girls' school would very much argue against that.  It would point to growing demand in the area.<\/p>  <p>  Some people might have a difficulty with the following but it is a point I wish to make.  This is an all-girls school.  We have recently had many discussions in the Chamber about gender and sending out the right message.  We have very young girls, from junior infants up to sixth class, being taught in substandard accommodation and not getting the supports they should.  We are failing in that regard.  There is an argument for Scoil Mhuire Lourdes girls' school to get DEIS status.  If there are any updates on the review, they could be provided to the school.  I appreciate the Minister of State will not have it now but could we get some information from the NCSE as to the rationale behind its decision?  I would think that is open to argument.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I mentioned climate change is that the argument the school is making is that it is right there on the doorstep of the Tullow community and it would save people travelling if the school had an autism spectrum disorder class.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000044#UU00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1644507900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>All schools that did so last year will automatically provide special educational needs facilities, which will be important going forward.

I do, however, understand from the NCSE that at present there is sufficient capacity for these children in other schools.  I do accept the point the Deputy is making that it is often in the best interests of children to attend a school in their own locality, and we should endeavour to facilitate that where possible.

As I said, there are already 800 or more schools in the country with DEIS status but every school will be up for review again.  As I said, the school does not need to apply and the situation will be looked at.  That the Deputy has brought it up as a Topical Issue matter will be brought to the attention of the Department.

Dublin City Council has been involved in an extensive programme to retrofit its housing stock and bring those homes to a reasonable energy rating.  This has entailed insulating attics, fitting heat pumps, doing wrap-around insulation or pumping insulation into walls, and changing windows and doors where necessary.  This has proved to be very successful, particularly as many of the houses that needed urgent retrofitting date back as far as the 1950s.<\/p>  <p>  The construction of some houses using precast concrete slabs, as is found in housing estates in Finglas south, has caused serious dampness and mould.

The external wrap-around insulation has eliminated much of these issues by sealing these gaps.  Solid walls require the wraparounds while other types of walls, such as double leaf, are pumped.<\/p> <p>There is less of an incentive for those in private dwellings to retrofit their homes, however, because they have to pay a substantial amount of the cost of such retrofitting.  The Government's plans to increase grant funding for such works from 30% to 35% at present up to 50%, as outlined in the recently launched national retrofit plan, will not incentivise those who are on low pay.<\/p> <p> The issue that really concerns me is that under existing rules, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, allows for only one visit to the residence for works to be carried out regardless of how minor these works might have been.  I am aware of quite a number of cases across the constituency of Dublin North-West in Ballymun, Finglas, Whitehall, Santry, Glasnevin and so on.  In many instances, only minor works were carried out and residents were refused a return visit.  I have dealt with examples of such cases whereby works to add insulation were carried out ten or more years ago and anyone today who had such minor works done is being refused further works.<\/p> <p> I am currently dealing with a particular case that illustrates the absurdity of the current rules when applying for retrofitting works to be carried out in a residence.  This is one example of many and concerns an elderly gentleman living alone in Whitehall who is on a pension and receives fuel allowance.  He had his attic insulated ten years ago.  He is currently in rehabilitation in hospital but will be returning home in the near future.  His house dates back to the 1950s and would require wraparound insulation and an upgrade to the heating system, among other measures, to bring it up to an acceptable energy standard.  His request for works to be done has been repeatedly refused because the SEAI is adhering to the Department's rule that it carries out one visit per home.  This senior citizen will return to a cold home and high energy costs he can ill afford as he tries to heat his house.  It has been promised since 2017 that this rule would be reviewed but to date there has been no movement on this issue.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that this matter is resolved and included in the Government's national retrofitting programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000044#UU00500","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644508500,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much for raising this issue.  As he will know, I care very much about it.  I am particularly interested to make sure the retrofitting money is targeted towards those who need it most.  I want to give the Deputy an update today on Government action on the better energy warmer homes scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government and climate action plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next ten years.  These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.  The recently published national retrofit plan sets out how we will achieve these targets and identifies an unprecedented &euro;8 billion to support homeowners to retrofit their homes to 2030.  It includes a range of measures aimed at supporting those least able to afford to retrofit.  This week, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, also announced further improvements to the supports available to homeowners to retrofit their homes in line with the commitments in the national retrofit plan.<\/p>  <p>  The better energy warmer homes scheme delivers free energy upgrades to eligible homeowners in low-income households who are vulnerable to energy poverty.  It is administered by the SEAI.  Since the start of the scheme in 2000, more than 143,000 free upgrades have been supported.  In 2021, the average cost of the energy-efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.  A budget allocation of &euro;109 million has been provided for the scheme this year.  This will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades from an average of 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year, helping to reduce waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has committed to reviewing the qualifying criteria for the scheme, including the rule that only allows for one visit to homeowners.  I am delighted to tell the Deputy that several revisions to the scheme were made this week to better target those in need.  One of these changes means that for the first time, applications will be accepted from qualifying homeowners who previously received supports under the scheme but could still benefit from even deeper measures.  This means applicants will now be able to have a second visit under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will target the worst performing properties by prioritising homes that were built and occupied before 1993 and those with a BER rating of E, F or G.  Existing applications will not be affected by this change, however.  The scheme eligibility criteria will also be extended to include those in receipt of disability allowance for more than six months and who have a child aged under seven years. The scheme is now open to applicants in receipt of the following welfare payments: fuel allowance; those receiving jobseeker's allowance for more than six months and with a child aged under seven; working family payment; one-parent family payment; domiciliary care allowance; carer's allowance where someone lives with the person he or she is caring for; and those receiving disability allowance for more than six months and with a child aged under seven.  The eligibility criteria are kept under ongoing review within the Department of Social Protection to ensure they are consistent with and complementary to the other income support schemes offered by that Department.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works under the better energy warmer homes scheme programme.  These include homes that are awaiting the initial survey of their home, those that have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor, those that have been allocated to a contractor for works and those that are currently undergoing works.<\/p>  <p>  Activity under this scheme and the associated expenditure were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the Covid-19 pandemic when construction activity paused for approximately 12 months in total in line with Government guidelines.  Activity ramped up again towards the end of the year, however, and there is confidence around the capacity to deliver 400 homes per month under the scheme this year.  Works under the scheme have restarted in line with activity in the residential construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  SEAI data indicate that for homes completed to date, in 2021, the average time from application to completion was 26 months, taking into account the increase in waiting times due to the impact of Covid-19.  For the same period, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 18 months.  A research network on fuel poverty, chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute, has been established to examine the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland.  The group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the SEAI and the Central Statistics Office.  The details I have outlined demonstrate the Government's significant commitments to supporting those at risk from energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000045#VV00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1644508500,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much.

More funding is obviously needed to enhance the scheme.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State say that we will get a second visit.  This has been a terrible bone of contention for many people, some of whom are very old people on pensions and some of whom are living in terrible conditions.  I have been repeatedly refused - I do not know how many times - and it is very frustrating.  I am glad this change is being made and I am waiting to see what that entails when the forms come out.  I am not sure whether it will be linked to any sort of time or anything like that.  I would not like to think we would link it and make it difficult for people.

That is very important.<\/p>  <p>  It is a fact that where Dublin City Council has done many of the wraparounds, small private dwellings in between have been left behind.  I would like to see better co-ordination between the SEAI and the local authority that is doing these wraparounds.

There are number of teams in operation and it is confusing but the SEAI can explain it.  The local authorities are carrying out their own direct upgrades on their own tenants.

Every local authority in Ireland has been allocated extra staff in order that they have the capacity to actually do the work, which was a fear.<\/p>  <p>  Under the better energy warmer homes scheme, which we are talking about, money is provided to people who are homeowners but on very low incomes.  They are often people who bought out their local authority homes.

It has a sustainable energy communities initiative whereby it sits down with people on a particular street to discuss how all their homes can be done together in a way that brings everybody on board.  There is some negotiation to be done in such cases because not everybody may be ready for the disruption involved in their home.  I will discuss the Deputy's point with the SEAI.  We are doing a large number of homes through those schemes.  My expectation is that 27,000 homes will be completed, not counting the 2,500 direct builds that will be done by local authorities.<\/p> <p> Up to 2018, the warmer homes scheme focused primarily on delivering shallow measures such as attic and cavity wall insulation.  Many of the people the Deputy is talking about perhaps had a small job done and they now need to go further than that.  He mentioned something that is very important, namely, indoor air quality and situations where condensation is coming down walls and leading to mould.  There is a very high incidence rate of black mould in Irish households, which leads to a much higher incidence of asthma here than is the case across the European population.  This measure is not just about energy, climate change and keeping people warm in their homes and bringing down their bills.

On Tuesday morning, well over 100 retail security officers were called into their individual stores at 9 a.m. to be told their contracts were being unilaterally passed, that is, outsourced to a security company, OCS, which works for Tesco, within six to eight weeks.  There was no engagement with the workers prior to their being called in and no engagement with their unions.  The workers, some of whom have been employed by Tesco for more than 20 years, have six to eight weeks to choose between redundancy or being outsourced.  Having given loyal service to Tesco, including working through two years of the pandemic, while most people were staying at home, to make sure society could eat and function, and putting their health and lives at risk in doing so, these workers should be treated as heroes and be getting pay increases and pandemic bonuses.  They should not be treated like this, potentially facing an insecure future in which their terms and conditions of work are very likely to be undermined over time.  We do not know whether OCS may lose its contract with Tesco in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Tesco has form for treating its workers badly.  The Minister of State may remember that, back in 2017, 250 of its employees were told to accept worse terms and conditions or leave.  Tesco brought in a plan called \"project black\", drawn up by a union-busting firm, to undermine the pay and conditions of its workers and the trade union, Mandate, thereby forcing workers to go on strike.  There was no need to attack those workers then and there is no need to outsource these workers now.  Tesco has never justified changes of employment for its workers.  It is one of the most profitable retailers in Ireland.  In the first half of 2016, the Tesco group registered profits of &euro;584 million.  In 2015, the CEO was paid &pound;4.6 million, including a &pound;3 million bonus.  The company has referred in the past to the Republic of Ireland as \"Treasure Island\".  Two weeks ago, an article in one of the Sundays newspapers headlined \"A happy Christmas for Tesco\" stated that Tesco Ireland had raised its profit outlook for the second time in four months.  A rise in Christmastime sales was reported, as well as a 0.2% sales increase in the quarter ending 27 November 2021.  End of year results for the 2021-22 retail year are slightly above the company's &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;2.6 billion projection.<\/p>  <p>  The race to the bottom that is the relentless campaign by some companies and multinationals to increase profits must stop.

As I am not familiar with the particular situation to which she referred, I will comment generally on the overall situation when companies are taken over or there is a transfer of undertakings.  I do not have the details of the case she raised but I certainly will get them and look into the situation.  I was not aware of the company to which the Deputy was referring until she mentioned it just now.<\/p><p>The European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 , often referred to as the TUPE regulations, may apply to any transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business from one employer to another as a result of a legal transfer, including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease, or merger.  I am not sure what the circumstances are in this particular case because I did not have the information the Deputy does.  As I said, I will keep my answer general.  In such situations, employees, in general, are protected and have rights under these regulations, which deal with the transfer of those rights to a new employer.  The regulations safeguard employees' rights in situations where a transfer falls within the definition contained in the regulations.  They provide that all the rights and obligations of an employer under a contract of employment, including terms inserted by collective agreements, other than pension rights, are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.  The new employer must continue to observe the terms and conditions of any collective agreements until they expire or are replaced.  Furthermore, an employee may not be dismissed by reason of the transfer alone.  However, dismissals may take place for economic, technical or organisational reasons involving changes in the workforce.<\/p><p>Both the outgoing and incoming employers are obliged to inform their respective employees' representatives of, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the reasons for the transfer and the legal, social and economic implications of that transfer.  Where there are no representatives, the employers must arrange for the employees to choose representatives for this purpose.  The Deputy mentioned a particular union and I assume that union will be involved in this case.  If not, employees should come together and appoint someone to be their representative.  The affected employees must be given the above information not later than 30 days before or, in any event, in good time before, the transfer, or, in the case of the transferee, before its employees will be affected by the transfer.  The Deputy referred to a period of six or seven weeks.  In all these situations, there should be good communication between all parties in order that everyone knows what is going on.  There should be no surprises, which is a comment I would make in general concerning the relationship between employer and employees in any business.<\/p><p>Where an employee considers that a breach of the regulations has occurred, a complaint may be made to an adjudication officer of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and appeals therefrom to the Labour Court.  Regarding the case the Deputy outlined, I would rather see companies engaging with employees in these situations to work things out.  I presume there is time for that to be done and I hope the employees engage with their unions and work through this in a sensible way.  They have protections under Irish law.  I am happy to engage further with the Deputy on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000046#WW00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1644509100,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am aware of the regulations regarding transfers of undertakings and have assisted workers to get their rights under that process.  It is inevitable in many cases that workers with good jobs that are permanent and secure, on which they base the securing of their mortgage or the payment of their rent and so on, may lose out if they are moved to new companies.  In the case of the bin collection workers, for example, who were local authority workers before moving to Greyhound in a transfer of undertakings, they were, in a matter of years, kicked out of their jobs.  The company brought in other workers and locked them out because they wanted to ensure their wages stayed as they were but the employer did not want to pay that wage.  That was the bottom line.<\/p>  <p>  The more than 100 hundred workers in Tesco are potentially facing the same situation.  The company did not even bother to meet with the unions and workers before making its decision.  Instead, they were brought in individually, which is a very underhand way to intimidate workers.  As a society, we should be dealing these multinational companies, which are very profitable and have no need to outsource their workers like this.  We should be looking at protecting full-time employment and security for workers.  We have been in a race to the bottom, which is moving workers towards part-time, insecure work.  These workers are in full-time employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said he did not know my question related to the situation at Tesco.  However, the question I put in referred to the fact that up to 180 retail security officers, many with long-term service, were told on Tuesday morning that Tesco is acting unilaterally to outsource their employment.  The company was named in the question I submitted.  We do not do enough to ensure our employment laws protect workers in these situations.

While many businesses thankfully survived that terrible vista, in no small way due to the financial supports from the Government, such as the wage subsidy schemes, the CRSS, waiving of rates, warehousing of tax returns etc., the re-opening presents its own challenges.  Not least of these is the impact of energy and fuel costs, but there is a further and serious issue of skills shortage and unavailability of work, both at home and, it would appear, in Europe.<\/p><p>This is a growing phenomenon, which has been exacerbated by delays in the processing, adjudicating and awarding of permits for workers, especially of those who are from outside Europe.  This is a case that is manifesting itself throughout the country and in my own constituency and many others in recent weeks.  It is against that backdrop that I wanted to read into the record two such representations.  The first is from an engineering company which is based in Tullamore.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe currently have over &euro;15 million worth of work ahead of us at present, all for export to the UK.  We are in serious need of fitter fabricators, turners and mechanical design engineers.  We have explored every avenue possible regarding advertising and recruitment agencies and cannot get the staff we require.  As you are aware, Barry, last year we had to recruit from outside the EU, which is a massive task and expense, but we had no option.  Going to all that effort and expense is one thing, but the extremely slow process of work permits and visas, even though we have a trusted partner status, is crazy.  The timeframe between work permit application and approval and then visa application is 20 to 22 weeks.  That is with all going according to plan.  We used a company last year to recruit eight men from Vietnam.  We paid &euro;8,000 to apply for eight work permits.  After nearly five months of waiting they were approved, but these men fell through, due to long wait for the permit.  We lost our &euro;8,000.  At this point, our situation is critical.  We have now employed the services of another recruitment company.  They have an expert in the field of recruitment from the Philippines.  We are currently going to try and take on ten fitter fabricators, at a cost of &euro;6,000 per person to recruit.  However, again, the issue with the processing of work permits is going to delay us hugely.  We need these workers urgently, Barry, and we cannot afford to be let down again.   <\/blockquote>  <p>A haulage company contacted me.  It stated:  <\/p> <blockquote> \tLike every transport and logistics company in Ireland, we have been operating during Covid-19 to keep open the supply chain links that are vitally necessary of course for the economic and social wellbeing of this country.  As you are aware, there is a crisis in our industry regarding the recruitment and retention of heavy goods vehicle drivers.  You have seen what happened in the UK, with shops shelves empty and panic buying at the forecourts.  We as an island nation that is predominantly rural are totally dependent and road haulage, because the only viable means of transport of waterways and rail are not viable or realistic options.  In this regard, we are at the coalface, collecting milk off-farm in the midlands and delivering animal feedstuff and fertilisers to farms, also in the midlands.  Without this service, the agricultural sector would grind to a halt.  Already, there is a real risk of milk not being collected off farms in 2022.  This, of course, would have a catastrophic impact on both farm and agri-processing industry.  To address this dilemma, this haulage company has commenced the recruitment process of South African drivers.  However, the process of obtaining work permits has dramatically slowed.  It is in this regard, Barry, that we need your assistance urgently.  We need these workers immediately, as we are now commencing a substantial 2022 milk collection season with Glanbia.   <\/blockquote>  <p>That is a just a flavour of what I am sure is also being relayed to the Minister of State by many other Deputies throughout the country.  I felt it necessary to read them into the record, in order to show it from the perspective of my own constituency.  While it is predominately rural, it is also dependent on acquiring a workforce from beyond Europe.  While the free movement of work and services within Europe was a welcome delivery from the EU over many years as a placement for a workforce, it has now dried up.  It is essential that we enter into agreements with other third countries that are outside Europe, some of which I have mentioned and many others of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  The Minister of State might update us on the efforts that his Department is making to address this issue so that we can confidently express our commitment to our constituents and to those companies that they may have an option in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000047#XX00500","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1644509700,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this issue, as well as for putting forward those two cases, which are familiar stories about the system, on the floor of the House.

I will not stand over it, our Department is not happy with it, and neither is the T&aacute;naiste.  The Taoiseach has addressed it here as well.  We have plans in place to address this, and we have a target to bring these timelines right back down.  However, they are a victim of Covid-19.  They are also a victim of the recovery phase that we are in as we come out of Covid-19, as well as of the demand for these permits.  While we are not happy with the timelines, I will explain to the Deputy what is behind them, and what we are doing to correct them.<\/p>  <p>  We hope to very soon, in the weeks ahead, be able to bring the timelines back down.  A plan of action is in place to keep them down, when we get to that stage.  The Deputy addressed the overall issue, apart from the permits, of a skills shortage, and he is right.  Thanks to all of the supports, which the Deputy referenced, from the Government over the last two years, we are in a position to have a jobs-led recovery.  However, that brings pressure on the system and a demand for skills and labour, which seems to be unable to be met from traditional sources within Ireland and across Europe for many sectors.  We have to respond to that in a combination of ways which include the permit scheme, but also through upskilling, education systems, further education and training, and engaging with the Department of Social Protection's Pathways to Work document, which is to assist employers and employees.<\/p>  <p>  I would ask that all of those sectors would engage with my Department and me, as well as with the Department of Education and with the Department of Social Protection, as we work together to resolve these issues into the long term.  This is because while permits can be seen as the solution in the short term, they should not be seen as the long-term fix.  I am happy to engage with Deputy Cowen and his colleagues on this issue.  <\/p>  <p>  To set the context, my Department and the employment permit system did continue to operate from the onset of the pandemic.  My Department implemented a Covid-19 contingency plan in March 2020, moving the employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment and to accept all documents from applicants electronically.  The Department moved quite fast to do that.  Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep its employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.  My Department made an agreement with immigration service delivery in the Department of Justice as a temporary measure, to take soft-copy arrangements for issuing employment permits.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to and to assist with the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all doctors&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; employment permit applications were expedited.  This is still ongoing and over 4,000 of those permits were issued in 2021, which put an additional pressure on the system.  The Department has seen unprecedented increases in the volume of applications for employment permits over the course of 2021.  In total last year, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 and a 47% increase based on 2019 figures.  This was an 11-year high in applications.  Even before Covid-19, therefore, this issue was growing, but Covid-19 has exacerbated it.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department issued more than 16,000 employment permits in 2021, and processed approximately 18,000 applications.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest review of the occupational lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.  We made changes in many areas in the autumn, as the Deputy referenced, including the construction sector, horticulture, meat processing and haulage.  We have allowed for additional permits to be granted in those areas and that has resulted in about 3,000 more applications being made.<\/p> <p> Processing times were also impacted by the HSE cyberattack last year.  We are still suffering from that backlog.  However, we have dealt with that and we have made changes to the system.  Due to the significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications and the cyberattack, we put in place extra staff who were temporarily reassigned to assist in the process.  That had a direct impact on the processing times.  I and officials in my Department, along with the T&aacute;naiste, recognise the impact delays on the processing times for employment permits has on businesses and their workers.  A plan of action has been developed to meet the challenges and to bring down the backlog that has built up over recent months.  The plan includes both additional staffing and systemic changes.  The staffing actions being taken include recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff, with an increase of 69% on our permanent capacity and 125% when temporary staff are included.  On 2 February, additional approval was granted to increase our staffing levels again.  Permanent capacity will increase by 125% and overall capacity, which includes permanent and temporary staff, will increase by 225%.<\/p> <p> We are now in a position to deal with this backlog quite quickly over the next couple of months and will retain those extra staff in the months ahead to deal with the ongoing demand for permits.  We are happy to work with individual sectors, like the haulage sector, on this issue.  Last year we proactively removed the limit on the number of people who could come into the country and we worked with the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority to get agreement with other countries on the recognition of driving skills.  That should assist in sourcing drivers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000047#XX00600","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644510300,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.  I appreciate much of what has been said, including his honest appraisal and acknowledgement of the problem.  I acknowledge the commitments that have been made and that are ongoing to address this issue, with the provision of new permanent staff and the allocation of temporary staff from other Departments to help.  I agree that there is potential for this country to respond in a way that can benefit us all, notwithstanding the difficulties associated with the inflationary measures that have been here longer than one would have expected and which may well be here longer than we would like as well.  It is imperative that we have a jobs-led recovery and that they are quality jobs and quality contracts with quality delivery.  We should maintain the standards that we have grown accustomed to in many specialist areas such as those I have mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the Government's progress in the provision of apprenticeship courses within the CAO system and the increase in the number of places.  I also acknowledge the work that has been done in targeting certain areas.  In my constituency, the Construction Industry Federation and Offaly ETB targeted and recognised the potential of the retrofitting programme.  I hope to visit there again tomorrow to see for myself the efforts being made to provide the sort of capacity that is needed in that sector to meet the demands of the system.  Provisions were announced this week that will be especially relevant for those incremental benefits that can accrue in my region because of people's dependence on solid fuel and oil and so forth.  They are in far greater need of action than many others who will be well-placed to take advantage of the &euro;25,000, and more luck to them if they can.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Government maintain the effort that is being made to address this issue.  There is recognition within the Department of the need to address this speedily and to do so in a way that ensures that companies that have built up a reputation can maintain it and that the quality of our workforce, its products and the expertise associated with it can be maintained and improved into the future.  Then that jobs-led recovery can play its part in ensuring that it responds positively, in addition to the Government intervention for the inflationary pressure on our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000048#YY00200","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1644510300,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I assure Deputy Cowen that every effort will be made by our Department to put enough staff in place and to change the system to make sure we can process these permits.  As I have outlined, there has been an increase in staff on these teams.  There are more than 50 additional people in the system and many of the existing staff are working overtime and every night they are allowed to work in order to deal with the backlog.  With the plan we have put in place, we will get through this backlog in the next few months and get back on track to normal processing times.  We are committed to monitoring the level of applications because I expect this demand to continue for a period.  We will monitor that and keep staffing at the level required to deal with that and keep on track.  We pride ourselves on having a very strong permit regime, which has worked quite well up until now and responds generally to the needs of the various sectors.  Processing times of 18 to 20 weeks are not acceptable and we will not continue with that.  I guarantee that there is a plan in place and that those the numbers will come back down.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the Deputy's comments.  The Government, including the Ministers for Social Protection, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Education, and I are happy to work with any sector with identifiable needs.  We do a lot of analysis in our Department on the future needs analysis of the various sectors and we have put many reforms in place in the educational system to respond to that.  The Deputy touched on the importance of the apprenticeship schemes and the further education and training sector.  Our ETBs are ready and able to respond and work locally and nationally with various sectors to turn out the skills they need.  There are still quite a number of people on jobseekers' payments or the PUP and we ask that they avail of the various supports to get back into work, retrain or take the subsidies for employees and employers in these sectors.  I am conscious that even with that, certain sectors will need skills from abroad.  We will work with them to make this an option but in the long term we would like to see those jobs filled from within the country, or certainly from within Europe, if at all possible.  We are happy to work with Deputy Cowen or any of the industries he has mentioned on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000048#YY00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An Bille um an Nao&uacute; Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (V&oacute;t&aacute;il Pharlaiminteach Chianda), 2020: An Dara C&eacute;im [Comhalta&iacute; Pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha] - Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Remote Parliamentary Voting) Bill 2020: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1644510300,"counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000048#YY00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1644510300,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go l&eacute;ifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&quot;<\/p><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I thank my colleagues across this House for their participation today and for their expressions of support for this Private Member&rsquo;s Bill.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for being here this afternoon.  I appreciate the encouragement and support of the National Women's Council of Ireland and Women for Election, which are supportive of this legislation.<\/p><p>The current Article 15.11.1 of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;All questions in each House shall, save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting other then the Chairman or presiding member.&quot;  In the Bill before us, a new proposed Article 15.11.4 is created in the following way, having deleted that section:<\/p> <blockquote> \tEach House may make its own rules and standing orders providing for special and limited circumstances by which members not present in that House may vote when any matter, or any class of matter as so provided for, is to be determined by a vote of that House. <\/blockquote>  <p>This constitutional amendment would remove the requirement to be present for every vote and would enable each House of the Oireachtas to include in its Standing Orders a mechanism by means of which Members could vote remotely or by proxy, in limited and specified circumstances to be determined by the Houses.  Moving this provision from the Constitution to the rules of these Houses has the advantage of being flexible over time, allowing the Houses to make periodic changes to those rules over the decades to come in order to account for evolving situations that we may not be able to foresee today.<\/p><p>There are situations that we can and do foresee, however, and which we have experienced.  There are at least three foreseeable situations in which a Member of the Houses should be permitted to vote remotely or by proxy.  First and most obvious is in a public emergency, such as the experience we have just emerged from, one like we had never seen before.  It was an emergency in which shared physical presence became the antithesis of public service.  The second circumstance is illness or someone being immunocompromised, where a Member must take physical time away from their parliamentary duties for certain and specific reasons.  For example, a Member may find themselves immunosuppressed or deeply unwell for a period of time.  Either through that long-term illness or the medical treatment for that illness, the Member may lose their ability to participate in parliamentary votes.  This would be due to no wish of their own, but only through a historical failure to have made inclusive provision for them.  There have been some examples of this happening over time, including among our colleagues in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>It is not for me to name them or to name any experience, but I am sure other Members will be aware of the natural life issues that face everyone in the working environment in here just as much as outside Leinster House.<\/p> <p> It is also important to say that this provision may enable a broader representation in these Houses from persons with seen and unseen disabilities, who may otherwise be perfectly able to participate in our national Parliament but who may need the additional supports that this provision may provide them from time to time.  The ability to participate differently is a proportionate and appropriate measure for us to be able to provide those who need to live life differently or with additional supports, and we have not as a House done enough to be as inclusive as I believe we can be.<\/p> <p> The third foreseeable situation is, of course, maternity and paternity leave.  People have babies.  It should not be a surprise but yet our working structures take no account of it in this House.  It automatically shuts off women of this land that we have not even considered them as equal natural participants in these Houses by providing for the most natural of life's events.<\/p> <p> This was particularly relevant at the time of the introduction of this Bill in this House on 8 December 2020, when my Fine Gael colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, had announced her pregnancy only three days before.  As the first woman sitting at Cabinet level in Ireland to take maternity leave, although it was facilitated in terms of her ministerial brief, essentially, a sticky plaster was used in terms of the Minister's attendance for voting in the D&aacute;il, in terms of her concurrent parliamentary duties.<\/p> <p> I have seen comment from those who may feel that this is a self-serving Bill and that it is politicians looking after themselves in some way.  From my own perspective, I know in my own heart at this stage that I will not need to avail of the maternity leave provision at this point in my career.  I certainly hope not to need sick leave or to ever see another public emergency in that way but we do not legislate for ourselves.  We legislate for those who come next and for the broader societal issues more generally.  The lack of an equivalent to maternity or paternity leave for representatives of the people is an impediment to a family-friendly and gender-sensitive working environment for Members and for the community of the Houses of the Oireachtas who see us and, indeed, visit here and participate with us here in committees and civic society participation more broadly.<\/p> <p> That issue was considered in great detail by the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament chaired by former Deputy Mary Upton, the report of which was presented to the Ceann Comhairle in November 2021.  I acknowledge the work of my parliamentary colleagues, Deputies Richmond and Cairns, Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Loughlin, who is Chair of the Women&rsquo;s Caucus, and Senators Chambers and Warfield who worked on this and, of course, the Ceann Comhairle, who established the forum in the first instance.  The forum states that maternity leave is a more obvious issue now that more women are putting themselves forward for election and getting elected - a natural consequence of having introduced gender-incentive legislation.  Of course, that proportion will go up even more.  We should have done it before now but it is an absolute imperative.<\/p> <p> There have been two Private Members' Bills that attempted to introduce leave, by Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, as the Ceann Comhairle then was in 2013, and by Deputies Niamh Smyth and Deputy Rabbitte, as the Minister of State was then, in 2018.  From having spoken with some of the sponsors of those Bills, essentially they got stuck on the question of voting and the constitutional requirements in relation to that.<\/p> <p> Importantly, the forum also acknowledged that, in 2021, there were two instances of pairing arrangements to cover two six-month periods of maternity leave for Members of these Houses.  The forum noted that in both cases it was other female Members who offered to enter into that arrangement, which is great but has the effect of further reducing the number of women voting in Parliament.  It was also noted by the forum that Members who had offered this arrangement had then faced criticism for failing to vote on certain occasions.  Such dependence on informal or more formal pairing arrangements is an insufficient response at this stage in the evolution of Parliament in our democracy.  It creates uncertainty generally.  It creates uncertainty for the Member who is on leave.  It has created problems for the Member who offered to help and it cannot be depended on in perpetuity in a modern parliament.  I believe it is not a sophisticated enough response for a modern parliament and we need to take steps to address it, being, as we are, on notice of the problem and being committed to the expansion of female representation in the Chamber.<\/p> <p> However, what heartened me most about the forum's report was its analysis of paternity leave and its acknowledgment that we must normalise such leave for men in this House, as we are trying to do in broader society.  Childcare is not only a female issue.  Childcare is a parents' issue.  There are a number of male Members of these Houses who have had babies in their families in the lifetime of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il and I often wondered throughout that whether it was honestly necessary for them to be in the convention centre or in this Chamber at 9 p.m., 10 p.m., 11 p.m., 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. each week as we voted on the business of that week, or whether, for the first few months of the baby&rsquo;s life, everyone might have been a little better served, including the Members' constituents, had they had the opportunity and been facilitated to vote remotely and provide more support and company at home for a specified and limited period at such a tender stage of family life.<\/p> <p> I want to also address the question of legal necessity in relation to this Bill because I am aware of and, indeed, greatly respect the views of constitutional academics who question whether this is necessary or whether it can be achieved through another route.  The reality is we have received legal advice on two separate legal grounds and on three occasions.  First, the Houses of the Oireachtas and, indeed, Members were advised that the Article 15 requirement to be present for voting was absolute.  That was the experience that we had as Members at the beginning of the pandemic.  I received that advice myself in the development of this Bill and I note the forum also comments that it received equivalent advice in relation to the necessity to be present for voting.  The forum then went a different way about it and considered the question of employee rights and the intersection of employee rights with maternity and paternity rights.  The forum's report, at page 24, states \"The Forum sought legal advice ... [and the] legal advice provided confirmed that Oireachtas Members are not considered as employees [as such] and, as a result, may not avail of certain employee [rights and] protections\" as would their constituents in other working environments outside these Houses.  As a priority recommendation, the forum states there should be a referendum to address remote working and proxy voting in these Houses.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that there is legal debate about this.  I share the enthusiasm for constitutional development and interpretation more broadly but the straight facts of working as a Member of this House are that we must act within the legal advice to continue to enjoy the presumption of constitutionality.  It is not available to us to act outside of that.  It is advice in any event with which I personally agree.<\/p> <p> It is, of course, a provision in other parliaments to facilitate remote and proxy voting and it has become more common as a consequence of the pandemic.  Remote voting is reasonably common in Spain for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  Romania introduced electronic voting, as did the European Parliament and Poland.  It has proved more difficult in Westminster-style parliaments but even in the UK it was introduced as a trial run in 2019 and, following two extensions, proxy voting was made permanent in cases of maternity leave.  There are now calls to extend that to include sick leave.<\/p> <p> Whatever mechanism we ultimately use, be it full leave, remote leave, proxy participation or some combination of those, what we need to ensure as we move into the next stage - if this Bill progresses and if it is successful at a referendum and if we end up in a situation of the Houses of the Oireachtas making arrangements for Members for the future - is we cannot be too prescriptive for Members.  We must make sure that the choice is determined by the Member, that the Member is facilitated to make the best choice for the Member and the Member's own circumstances, both in early parenthood and in terms of the Member's own assessment of what the Member wants to do in terms of his or her work.  There is no question but that at every turn and in every analysis, the ability to participate in votes remotely or by proxy is the first hurdle to overcome and that hurdle is grounded in the current constitutional provision.<\/p> <p> If the constitutional change moves through this House and is supported and if it is put to a referendum, I note at the outset that I have never envisaged that this be a stand-alone event.  It was always the case that this referendum would never be appropriate or suitable during a pandemic period.  Naturally, to facilitate the best running of parliamentary democracy and democracy more generally, you do not want to have referendums that are sticking out on their own for no good reason for us to ask people to come to vote on that.  There is a natural confluence with the work being done with the Committee on Gender Equality, established as a consequence of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, of which I am a member and of which Deputy Bacik, who is here today, is Chair.  That committee is working specifically at the direction of the Citizens' Assembly on three referendums related to gender equality and it seems like a natural friend that this referendum might sit alongside three referendums such as those at some point in the future.  There is no need to take it out on its own, but perhaps consider it in the round.<\/p> <p> What I envisage, if it were passed and got the support of the Irish people to make this change, is that it will be then a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the type of votes or the types of class of votes, the types of scenarios that are included and not included, the periods for which that might be appropriate or not appropriate, the mechanism by which a Member might apply formally, what the Member might expect in relation to that and, indeed, provision for making changes to those rules over time.<\/p> <p> As we all sit here - many of the Members support this Bill and I thank them for that - I am all too aware how much further we must go to achieve true representation in our representative Chamber - whether it is more women, whether more people with disabilities or younger people who perhaps do not see politics as an option that they can juggle alongside the potential of a young family.<\/p> <p>It is our job now to think about those who will come after us and to make every provision possible to allow for a larger number of people to seriously consider this job as one they could do while also having a family and to be available to them at those tender moments.  We must show that the practical realities of life outside Leinster House apply in here too.  Otherwise, how are we to attract a broader group of representatives to our representative Chamber?  I look forward to the debate and commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000048#YY00600","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644511500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Before proceeding, I wish to bring a couple of points to the attention of Members.

I thank and commend Deputy Carroll MacNeill on introducing this Bill to the House.  The Bill seeks to amend Article 15 of the Constitution to allow both Houses of the Oireachtas to put into Standing Orders circumstances under which Members could vote remotely.<\/p>  <p>  It is very timely that we are debating this issue now.  First, because we have seen at first hand the effect the pandemic has had over the past two years on the workings of the Oireachtas and, second, because as a collective we are currently looking at initiatives that could bring about a more family-friendly and inclusive Parliament.  The issue of remote voting is an important part of that conversation.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past two years, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact here in Ireland and on societies and economies across the globe.  We know that it is still with us, but thanks to the sacrifices made by people over many months, the strength of solidarity among communities across the country and through the intervention of science with effective vaccines, we hope that the worst is over and that the pandemic's impact is receding.  However, similar to other pandemics in the past, Covid-19 leaves in its wake societal, economic, political and cultural changes that will last far beyond the pandemic itself.  As policymakers, we must acknowledge this and plan for the new dynamics in our personal and working lives that are now becoming a reality.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill's Bill fits right in to this conversation in terms of changes in how we work here in this House.  The use of technologies for remote working have been with us for many years, but none of us realised that physical meetings would be completely replaced by virtual ones.  It never occurred to us that significant decisions could be made without having to meet face to face.  It has also made us realise how efficient virtual meetings can be, as the need for travelling to and from meetings and commuting from home to the workplace is no longer always necessary.  It also had many other positive benefits in terms of issues such as childcare and other caring responsibilities.  The pandemic has led to a seismic shift in how we now view our working lives.  For many people and businesses remote working or a form of blended or hybrid working is becoming a mutually beneficial work model that can lead to better choice for workers and increased productivity.  The Government fully recognises this.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes several commitments on remote working.  Remote work is already a key consideration in the national economic plan, the climate action plan, the town centre living initiative and the smarter travel policy.  The Government is committed to increasing remote work adoption in Ireland through removing barriers, developing infrastructure, providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.  The Government's remote work strategy, published in January last year, built on the progress made in the adoption of remote work over the Covid-19 crisis period.  The strategy set out plans to strengthen the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees to provide the infrastructure to work remotely and sets out clear guidance on how people can be empowered to work remotely away from the employer's premises.<\/p>  <p>  A key part of the strategy is a legislative framework and last month, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment published the general scheme of the Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2022.  The legislation will set out a clear framework to facilitate remote and blended working options, in so far as possible.  The Bill will give every employee the right to request remote working from their employer.  It will ensure that when an employer declines a request, that there are stated, reasonable reasons for doing so and that conversations with workers will take place is a structured way.  It will give employers and workers legal clarity on remote working, which became the default for many during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that remote working is not for everyone or for every organisation or workplace and a balanced approach to this issue is required.  It will, however, ensure that there are better choices and options available for people.  The legislation is a key part of the Government's spring legislative programme.  Work is also under way to deliver a policy of blended working in the Civil Service.  A policy document was published last July and the goal is to deliver a blended working policy that can provide flexibility to both employees and employers in a manner that supports the continued delivery of high-quality services to the public and to businesses while at the same time providing employees with choice and opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  What does all this mean for Members of the Oireachtas?  We know that the way we work changed over the past two years.  The requirement for social distancing led to an increased use of virtual meetings and it has ongoing benefits.  The Business Committee of the D&aacute;il, which meets every Thursday to order the business of this House, continues to meet virtually and I think members of that committee would agree that the use of virtual meetings is a great support to the more efficient use of Members' time.  The pandemic has brought into sharp focus an issue that has been discussed for a long time in Leinster House, that of a more family-friendly Parliament.  All of us who have the privilege to work here representing our constituents recognise that it is a somewhat atypical workplace, with working hours that make work-life balance challenging, particularly for those Members with young children, with other caring responsibilities and those who live far from Leinster House.  I congratulate the forum on a family-friendly and inclusive Parliament and its chair, the former Deputy, Mary Upton, for producing an excellent report in November of last year which puts forward many recommendations on how we might achieve the goal of a more family-friendly and inclusive Parliament.  Some of the recommendations echo the proposals in the Private Members' Bill we are discussing here today.  I was very pleased in recent days to have been able to implement one of the recommendations in the report, which was to better align the D&aacute;il calendar with school holidays.  Following on from a request from the Ceann Comhairle and with the agreement of the Business Committee, I have amended the D&aacute;il calendar so that the Easter break in the D&aacute;il aligns with the school Easter holidays.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that a steering group is being put together to work on the overall implementation of the recommendations in the report.  I encourage all Members to support this important initiative.  One of the most difficult issues that needs to be addressed for Oireachtas Members is that of maternity leave, paternity leave and sick leave.  The report from the forum highlights the fact that these issues are a significant impediment to a family-friendly, inclusive and gender-sensitive working environment for Members.  Similar concerns were addressed in the report of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality, published in June of last year, which recommended making maternity, paternity and parental leave available to all elected representatives, including Ministers and to provide flexible working options, including remote working and voting and adjusting meeting times and rules, to suit caring responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed in the programme for Government to develop supports and alternatives for Oireachtas Members to take parental leave.  My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, recently met with members of the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus to get their views on how the provision of maternity leave for Members of the Oireachtas would operate.  There will be further engagement with Oireachtas Members on the matter over the coming weeks and months to see how best these issues can be addressed.  I look forward to the outcome of the discussions.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to the specifics of the Bill before us this evening.  In introducing this Bill, Deputy Carroll MacNeill had in mind that remote voting would greatly assist those Members on maternity, paternity or sick leave being able to participate in the legislative process.  The Bill, in accordance with Article 46 of the Constitution, seeks to amend Article 15 of the Constitution to provide for each House of the Oireachtas to put into its Standing Orders circumstances under which Members could vote remotely.  At present, the Constitution does not allow for the Oireachtas to sit or to vote remotely.  Article 15.1.3&deg; of the Constitution envisages that the Houses of the Oireachtas will sit in or near Dublin, but that the Oireachtas can sit in such other place as they may determine, which is understood to mean another physical location.  Article 15.11.1&deg; provides that all questions in each House shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the Members present and voting other than the Chairman.  This is understood as requiring the physical presence of Members.  This constitutional provision led to the development of innovative solutions to ensure that the Oireachtas could continue to do its work and that votes could be taken during the pandemic while ensuring the safety of the parliamentary community.  Once again, I thank the Houses of the Oireachtas Service for all its hard work in keeping both Houses up and running in two separate locations, while at the same time keeping everyone safe.<\/p> <p> Of course, this was not the only parliament that had to tackle the issue of members having to be present to vote.  I noted with interest a report by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service from April 2020 which stated that remote voting was the most challenging parliamentary procedure most parliaments had to deal with during the pandemic.  Countries such as the UK, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland and Israel all require their members to be present and voting.  The solutions found by other parliaments were similar to those of the Oireachtas, with the use of remote meetings where possible, reduced footfall within parliament buildings and agreement among all members on reduced voting.<\/p> <p> I note the report of the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament also recommends that Article 15 of the Constitution be amended.  The Deputy&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill aims to address remote voting by amending Article 15.11 of the Constitution with the insertion of a new subsection 4 which states, &ldquo;Each House may make its own rules and Standing Orders providing for special and limited circumstances in which members of the House concerned, who are not present in that House, may vote when any matter or any class of matter as so provided for, is to be determined by a vote of that House.&rdquo;  This is a complex matter and one that will require significant thought.  Any changes to Article 15.11 in terms of remote voting or any wider changes allied to that in terms of remote working would also need to take into account other provisions in the Constitution.  Article 15.1.3o of the Constitution envisages that the Houses of the Oireachtas will sit in or near Dublin, or in such other place as they may determine, which is understood to mean another physical location.  We would have to examine how this would fit into a scenario where Members are participating virtually.  Following on from the constitutional requirement to be physically present in a physical structure, how would virtual participation work with Article 15.12 of the Constitution, which provides for utterances in the House being privileged?<\/p> <p> Finally, we must also ensure, in an overall way, that the much-needed introduction of family friendly policies is balanced appropriately with the constitutional obligation under Article 16 that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann be composed of Members who represent constituencies determined by law.<\/p> <p> These are all matters that need to be examined and analysed closely and are questions that have been discussed in these Chambers for a long time now.  The pandemic has shown us that when something has to be done, it can be done.  We have a great opportunity now to work together to identify and to provide the longer term solutions that will make the Oireachtas a more family friendly and inclusive Parliament.  This, in turn, it is hoped, will encourage more people to participate in political life.<\/p> <p> As I have stated, the Government is not opposing this Bill.  I again sincerely congratulate Deputy Carroll MacNeill on proactively proposing this Bill and providing an opportunity and a focus for addressing this issue as part of the overall discussion on this agenda.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Deputies present and debating this important matter further in the context of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000050#AAA00500","speaker":"1475","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644512100,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and I commend Deputy Carroll MacNeill on bringing it forward.  The Government will be supporting it, as the Chief Whip has outlined.  It is a very important Bill.  What it does is put beyond doubt the availability of remote voting and remote participation, should it be passed in a referendum.  That is a very necessary and crucial part of our response to the recent pandemic and to other matters.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has well described the family friendly situations and arrangements that may be assisted through legislation of this type.  The Deputy spoke about small babies.  Even for someone whose babies are no longer small, coming in at 1 a.m. regularly on a midweek night is not necessarily welcome or conducive to good household management, so I believe it goes across the board.  Those measures are very well described by the Deputy and very important.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, there was some legal debate on what the requirements actually say at present and what was interpreted at the time within the Oireachtas.  I commend the Oireachtas on its flexibility in the management of the pandemic, but there may have been ways in which the existing provisions could have been interpreted somewhat differently to have allowed this kind of activity to take place.  As the Chief Whip has outlined with regard to the constitutional provisions in Article 15.1.3o and Article 15.11 in terms of Deputies being present and voting and in terms of the Oireachtas meeting in Dublin or some other place, there is nothing in the Constitution that says that other place must be a physical place.  Apart from the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;, Cork, Galway, Limerick or anywhere else is not prescribed and there is some academic debate that &ldquo;a place&rdquo; could be a virtual place.  The Internet is a place.  If there was a requirement for it to be physical, which is not in the text of the Constitution, a server farm or a hosting facility is a physical place and the IP network is a physical place.  Suffice to say, there has been significant discussion on that point.  I think &ldquo;a place&rdquo; could be interpreted as being a virtual place.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of people like Ciar&aacute;n Toland SC and the constitutional reform group, which has put significant academic endeavour into this.  They would speak to the purpose of the interpretation of the Constitution in terms of what the founding fathers envisaged when they were framing these provisions.  They envisaged it would be secure and safe and would involve representatives from all over the country &ndash; Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, or messengers to the House.  There is nothing to suggest they intended it would be one physical sitting in one place.  If we take that purpose of interpretation, we can see the arguments that they make.<\/p>  <p>  On another point, Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Conaill, a noted academic, pointed out that the Irish version of the Constitution, which takes precedence in the event of any conflict, refers to &ldquo;n&oacute; cib&eacute; &aacute;it eile&rdquo;, or &ldquo;wherever else&rdquo;, loosely translated.  &ldquo;Wherever else&rdquo; is even less prescriptive in terms of being open to interpretation and flexibility.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, if this Bill is passed, a referendum would put it beyond doubt.  It is notable that many other institutions have already embraced such remote decision-making.  The courts, that other arm of the State under the separation of powers, have already embraced it with gusto and there have probably been thousands of High Court decisions ordered, made and ruled over the past two years, and that has not been challenged in any credible or successful way.  It is also a fact the Cabinet has met in an incorporeal fashion for many years now, and that continues to take place notwithstanding the constitutional provisions around it.  Put simply, remote participation is to be encouraged and welcomed.  I am unconvinced we actually need to change the laws to do it, but let us do it if it helps to get that clarity and foundation to enable it to happen.<\/p>  <p>  It is a very important Bill and I commend the Deputy on bringing it forward.  I certainly support its intent and its detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000051#BBB00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1644512100,"counter":492,"content":"<p>We have to recalibrate because we have nine speakers and limited time.

I commend Deputy Carroll MacNeill on the introduction of this Bill, which is an eminently sensible solution to a constitutional problem.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Lawless for making the point that the Irish version of the Constitution takes precedence and it is far less prescriptive in regard to where, and I think the &ldquo;where&rdquo; is important.  A debate did ensue when we were relocated to the Convention Centre as to what &ldquo;where&rdquo; meant, and whether it could be a constituency office, for instance.  We have to come up with reasonable solutions to what is an eminently resolvable issue and Deputy Carroll MacNeill's proposal does just that.<\/p>  <p>  I am reminded, in reading her First Stage speech, as I did this afternoon in preparation for this debate, that I can think of literally two dozen Members of the House in my 11 years here who would have, and undoubtedly could have, availed of such a provision if it were law.  I am thinking of at least two Members I can recall who themselves have had babies: Deputy Niamh Smyth and the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  Quite a number of Deputies, including two current Deputies I am aware of, me and Deputy Dillon, have become fathers while Members of the House.  I can think of many occasions where, as Deputy Lawless mentioned, it was not exactly conducive to a family friendly parliament.  In fact, I recall the Ceann Comhairle made a big deal out of the fact a well-known newscaster had made a point about family friendly being the focus of the Oireachtas yet we were voting on our weekly divisions at 2:33 a.m., and how ironic it was.  There are many occasions where Members would very much appreciate the opportunity, in a secure manner, under certain circumstances, as the Deputy outlined in her Bill, where we could press a button to vote or indicate visually to other Members.  For the benefit of people watching at home, we have enormous televisions in this Chamber which are eminently visible to all of us, and I am sure other provisions could be made to ensure the security of the vote is never questioned.<\/p>  <p>  I am also thinking of Members who have injured themselves.<\/p> <p>The Ministers of State, Deputies Naughton and Madigan, for instance, have injured themselves during this D&aacute;il term and it might not have been possible for them to leave their homes but they could have participated or voted, or both.  Deputies Naughten and Cannon have had serious injuries in the recent past and after a period of convalescence they probably would have been able to participate or vote, or both, if they wanted to.  It is imperative that we take the lead of the European Parliament.  I had reason to sit and watch a debate in the European Parliament and it was evident that Members all over Europe were participating in parliamentary debates in Brussels via a secure link.  I am not sure whether they voted; they probably indicated their preference on issues during the course of a particular debate.  That is something we can achieve.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy has rightly outlined, this could not be a stand-alone referendum but it is an opportunity for us to put together a number of minor suggestions, not that this is minor.  However, there are minor questions that the public would be encouraged to support and this is most likely one of them.  There are a number of others.  I recall, as I am sure the Acting Chairman will, a thorough debate on the programme for Government in 2011 about having a referendum day to update our Constitution.  That included, in particular and probably most importantly, a suggestion to have a referendum on the reference to a woman&rsquo;s place being in the home, which the Government has let fester for 11 years.  I am never happy with that because there have been lots of opportunities for us to undo it but we have not done so.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for us to have a referendum on something of substance and that is important, to which this referendum would lend itself because it is about a family friendly Parliament, treating women as equals, and ensuring that Members of the House can participate or vote, or both, when it is deemed appropriate by the Houses, for which this House determines anyway.  That is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000051#BBB00400","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644512700,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for all her work on this and for bringing this Bill before the House.  The fact that it has such strong cross-party support is welcome and good to see.  That speaks to the fact that this Bill is a common sense one that would make life in politics more inclusive, family friendly and flexible in adapting to emergency situations when they arise.<\/p>  <p>  This is a particularly important Bill for women.  The lack of provision for maternity and family leave can be off-putting for young women considering a career in politics and as Deputy Carroll MacNeill has outlined, the Bill would provide for a proxy parliamentary voting system to formally allow various types of leave, including maternity, parental and adoptive leave, a provision we definitely need.  Recently we were forced to look at this matter and the fact that no Cabinet Minister previous to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, had ever been pregnant in office tells us all we need to know about how welcoming Irish politics is for young women who want to start a family.  I hope this Bill will encourage a conversation and start a process of significant and positive change to improve our parliamentary community.  For so long we have witnessed real barriers to consideration of a career in our national Parliament.  This Bill was a key recommendation of the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament last year, which was initiated by our Ceann Comhairle.  It is a recommendation that will make life as a parliamentarian a more attractive, rewarding and accessible career option for people from every walk of life.<\/p>  <p>  This is important given the challenges we faced in these past two years.  It is vital that lessons are learned and that we properly equip ourselves for any potential future emergencies that might arise.  It is also important that any fears about this measure being abused should be alleviated by the fact that the Bill would  provide for remote or proxy voting only in limited and specified circumstances.  We need our Parliament to be more diverse, flexible and adaptable.  I welcome the role this Bill will play in improving parliamentary life on both those fronts.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  The Deputy is an active member of the Oireachtas women&rsquo;s caucus, which is a great example of female parliamentarians coming together, leaving their politics at the door and utilising their time to unite in their cause for a diverse and inclusive Parliament and for legislation that benefits women up and down this country.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill comes from a legal background and it is fantastic to see her utilising her professional experience and technical knowledge to bring forward such a progressive Bill.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill and I worked together for a while about a decade ago and I can clearly remember her answer from then when someone asked her what was her favourite book.  It was Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Constitution of Ireland.  That is why it is so special to see her bringing forward a Bill today that may well pave the way to an amendment to that very Constitution.  I congratulate the Deputy; well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000052#CCC00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1644512700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I am slightly concerned about what bedtime stories in the Carroll MacNeill household contain but I am grateful to Deputy Higgins for that elusive comment.  I sincerely welcome this Bill and I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for introducing it.<\/p>  <p>  If it was not for a global pandemic, there is no chance I would have had any paternity leave with my second child.  I distinctly remember leaving the National Maternity Hospital on Holles Street for a vote in the Seanad two days after the birth of my first child.  It was not much craic for me, the child or my wife and I am still regularly reminded of it.  This goes to the point that our democracy is not fit for purpose in representative terms.  There are far too many archaic barriers to ensuring this Parliament is truly representative of the entire society.  This Bill goes a small way to rectifying that but I hope it is sincerely, as Deputy Alan Farrell has mentioned, the start of a general approach to relooking at how we do parliamentary democracy in this country.  We should use the examples of other countries and use the opportunities and lessons of the pandemic to produce a much better form of parliamentary democracy.  I referenced access to paternity leave, and far more importantly, I want to reference access to maternity leave for Members of the Oireachtas.  What also requires due consideration is those who might require sick leave or have become immunocompromised, and their ability to carry out their duties as Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  I reference the case of Amy Callaghan, who is the Member of the Parliament in Westminster for East Dunbartonshire for the Scottish National Party.  This week, against doctor&rsquo;s orders she has returned to the UK Parliament so that she can vote and speak on a Bill.  She is putting her life at risk as an immunocompromised person who suffered a serious brain haemorrhage not so long ago in order to simply do her job.  The fact is the Houses of Parliament were able to make changes to maternity leave but we have to see it through to make sure these changes are fully encompassing.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill mentioned, I was one of the Oireachtas Members who sat on the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament.  Over the course of a number of meetings, all held virtually under the good chairpersonship of Mary Upton, a number of issues came out.  The report has been put in every Member&rsquo;s pigeon hole at this stage and I hope they all have a chance to read it.  I appreciate that some of the 54 recommendations are probably far-reaching and not realistic.  It showed the dynamic of having a forum made up of parliamentarians along with people from the private sector, the NGO sector, and society at large.  There is some obvious and low-hanging fruit and there are some obvious wins that could make this democracy so much more inclusive and accessible.  I fundamentally believe the passage of this Bill and, in due course, the passage of a related referendum, is one of those obvious things.  I am slightly concerned that when an opinion poll about this Bill was put up on one of the news sites, there was quite a lot of opposition to it.  The commentary that ensued was the type of anti-politics and anti-democratic commentary that all of us have a responsibility, regardless of party and of whether we agree with this legislation or not, to combat.  That goes for everything we do in this House and in these Houses but it is of major concern.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the semi-related point of privilege.  One of the things that struck those of us who were members of the forum &ndash; I hope it struck all of us in recent months &ndash; was the situation in committees.  We were all dialled into meetings but we all had to travel into Leinster House to make use of privilege.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely farcical and it should be changed. That would give Deputies and Senators, particularly those from outside Dublin, the opportunity to participate in committee meetings on Tuesdays while gaining a precious four hours or 24 hours with their families at home.<\/p> <p> I commend this Bill and look forward to supporting it through all Stages.  I also look forward to campaigning in a referendum to amend the Constitution very soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000052#CCC00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644513300,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I also commend Deputy Carroll MacNeill on putting forward this far-seeing Bill which seeks to amend our Constitution and ultimately change the way we do things in this building so that it becomes a far more family-friendly workplace.<\/p>  <p>  I have been deeply fortunate to have been walking in the gates of Leinster House for 15 years now.  It is an extraordinary privilege to be able to do so, to represent the people of Galway East, to air their views and their aspirations for the Ireland they aspire to.  We never lose sight of that.  I do not think any one of us in this House ever loses sight of what an extraordinary privilege it is to be here.  That said, 15 years ago I had a ten-year-old son.  He is now 25 and very happy but there is no question that my relationship with him suffered in those 15 years as a result of the work practices within this building.  In the last number of years, those work practices have become even less family friendly and continue to pile even more pressure on all of us who work within this Parliament.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill not alone gives us cause to reflect on the very specific changes that need to be made to our Constitution to make this place a far more family-friendly workplace, it should also force us into questioning what other aspects of this workplace make it so unfriendly to being parents and carers for those who matter to us in our lives.  When we introduced gender quotas a number of years ago, it was a very welcome development in terms of making this House, and indeed the other House, a far more diverse place that is far more representative of Irish society as a whole.  However, I always felt that it was not the far-reaching solution that we needed in order to ensure that we would see that kind of diversity in Leinster House.  Quotas are part of the solution but I fundamentally believe that we could throw open the gates of Leinster House tomorrow morning to people from all walks of life but once they had an opportunity to talk to somebody who works here, they might think twice about pursuing a career in politics.  Ultimately, that is what we have to look at here.  How do we ensure that anybody who is contemplating a life in politics, a life of public service and democratic representation feels they are going into a place that is family friendly and conducive to having good, strong healthy relationships with those people who matter in their lives?  This is really important and ground-breaking legislation from Deputy Carroll MacNeill that forces us to ask questions of ourselves, to ask what we need to do to ensure that kind of change happens.  <\/p>  <p>  At the end of what has been an extraordinarily challenging time for our country in terms of the pandemic and as we return to normal, it is very important that we question what aspects of normal are worth returning to.  If all we do is turn the page and return to 2019 and if things continue on as they did before, then we will have lost the opportunity to learn a lot of very valuable lessons from how things were done during that time.  We pressed the fast forward button on how we can shape our workplaces for the future.  Remote working became part of life for those of us who work in this place and for many thousands who work elsewhere.  In that context, we should lead by example and look at opportunities to allow for participation in the parliamentary process from remote locations.  Perhaps it will not be as difficult as we think and the technology certainly exists to allow us to do that.  There are successful examples of this in other countries and, as others have said, in the European Parliament itself.  That can be the new normal.<\/p>  <p>  The women and men who drafted our Constitution 80 years ago never envisaged the world we live in right now, in 2022.  They never envisaged the opportunities that are presenting to us right now to create far more family-friendly workplaces that people would find attractive.  This is a very special moment in the life of the Houses of the Oireachtas, when we look to establish a workplace that is family friendly and conducive to people being normal, active and participative members of society.  I commend Deputy Carroll MacNeill and look forward to seeing the remaining elements of this legislation passing as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000053#DDD00200","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1644513300,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the chance to speak on this important Bill and I commend Deputy Carroll MacNeill on her initiative in bringing it forward.  It is really important that we are debating this very timely legislation and it is really good to hear the very honest contributions to the debate from the men and women who have spoken.  When I was first elected to these Houses in 2007, to the Seanad, I was pregnant with my second daughter.  It was shocking to me how difficult it was to accommodate a baby within these precincts.  I was very grateful to the women Members who had gone before me on whose initiative a cr&egrave;che had been established.  After some difficulty, I was able to access the cr&egrave;che which was hugely helpful.  It meant that I could run over and breastfeed a small baby and contribute to Seanad debates on a part-time basis.  In those early months, one really wants to be spending as much time at home as possible but at the same time, as an elected representative, when there was no provision for maternity leave, there was an imperative to also be contributing.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is an important part of a whole package of measures that are necessary to modernise our Parliament, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill said herself, and to make it more inclusive, more friendly towards women, towards men with caring responsibilities, more family friendly and more flexible.  It is timely because as we are coming through the pandemic, all of us have learned the benefits of remote working.  All of us are navigating that process of trying to facilitate more working from home.  When we are seeing that debate taking place in workplaces more generally, it is very important that we in the Houses of Oireachtas would lead by example and seek to facilitate remote working.  It is unfortunate that it will require a constitutional amendment to do so.  I have spoken with my colleague Deputy Howlin, who has long experience of D&aacute;il procedure, and he says that it should be possible to allow for committees to conduct hearings remotely and to continue to do so.  We are doing it already but there is this strange anomaly whereby we can participate in committee meetings remotely from our offices but not from outside the precincts.  I live a ten-minute cycle away from Leinster House, in Dublin Bay South.  I cannot participate remotely in a committee meeting from my home office but I can participate from my office here in the precinct.  There are anomalies that require addressing and it is very important, therefore, that we bring this legislation forward.<\/p>  <p>  As others have said, this is also in keeping with recommendations that were made by Mary Upton's excellent committee on a family friendly and inclusive parliament and with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality.  I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for her reference to my work in that regard.  I am very proud and honoured to have been appointed as Chairperson of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Gender Equality.  Our brief or remit is to ensure the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality.  One of those recommendations in particular, recommendation No. 23, relates to improving family-friendly practices for all representatives elected to public office.  The Citizens' Assembly recommended flexible working options, not just within Parliament but also at local authority level.  It also recommended making maternity, paternity and parental leave available to all elected representatives, including Ministers.  That is long overdue.  I was glad, in another role as Vice Chair of the women's caucus, along with Senator Fiona O'Loughlin, to meet the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and hear his proposals for bringing forward maternity, paternity and parental leave for public representatives.  <\/p>  <p>  There is clearly a momentum behind these measures and that is really important.  The Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality will be putting forward very practical recommendations to Government as to how to implement the Citizen's Assembly recommendations.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said, among our recommendations will be how we bring forward those three recommendations for constitutional change to create a more inclusive Constitution, one that is updated and that provides for gender equality, a more inclusive definition of family and that will change the very sexist language around women's role and the role of mothers.  <\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The amendment that Deputy Carroll MacNeill is proposing in this Bill would be an integral part of a package of amendments to be put to the people in one day.  That would be a really good way of approaching this, not so much as a stand-alone amendment but one that is very much part of an amendment that is about creating a more gender-equal Ireland where women have a more equal status and, in particular, where women are more facilitated, supported and encouraged in running for public office.  We should not forget that our Parliament still looks very male, stale and pale - perhaps not as much as it was when I was first elected to the Seanad in 2007, but it is certainly still very, very male.  After my election to the D&aacute;il last year, I was very struck by how different it is from the Seanad.  Only 23% of Deputies are female.  There is 40% women's representation in the Seanad.  Let us make the D&aacute;il more representative of women and let us bring forward a range of measures to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000053#DDD00300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644513900,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Carroll MacNeill as an reachta&iacute;ocht th&aacute;bhachtach seo a thabhairt chun tosaigh.

Bheadh fadhb ann mar n&iacute;limid eagraithe mar institi&uacute;id chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le gn&aacute;thshaol m&aacute;ithreacha, n&oacute; daoine de gach uile inscne.  Rugadh m&rsquo;in&iacute;on nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; tofa anseo ar feadh bliana.  N&iacute; raibh aon saoire aithreachais n&oacute; m&aacute;ithreachais i gceist ag an am sin agus n&iacute; raibh aon smaoineamh ann faoi.  Tagann br&uacute; laistigh den ph&aacute;irt&iacute; chun bheith ar ais, go h&aacute;irithe m&aacute;s p&aacute;irt&iacute; beag at&aacute; ann.  N&iacute; d&uacute;irt aon duine liom bheith ar ais mar ba mise an Whip ag an am - bh&iacute; m&eacute; in ann a r&aacute; liom f&eacute;in nach g&aacute; dom bheith anseo ach tagann an br&uacute; sin.  Tagann s&eacute; ar gach duine ach t&aacute; s&eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca, b'fh&eacute;idir, i ngr&uacute;pa&iacute; m&oacute;ra.  Thar na blianta mar Whip, nuair a th&aacute;inig tuismitheoir&iacute; le p&aacute;ist&iacute; &oacute;ga chugam ag lorg p&eacute;ire&aacute;il, rinne m&eacute; iarracht clo&iacute; leis sin ionas go mbeadh deis acu dul abhaile nuair a bh&iacute; an seans acu, c&eacute; nach raibh an seans againn i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart go bhf&eacute;achaimid ar an gceist seo.  N&iacute;or thit an domhan as a ch&eacute;ile ar bhealach amh&aacute;in n&oacute; bealach eile nuair a bh&iacute; muid ag obair &oacute;n mbaile le linn na paind&eacute;ime.  Ba l&eacute;ir do gach duine go raibh muid in ann, n&oacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid in ann, v&oacute;ta a chaitheamh &oacute;n mbaile.  Is f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i ngach uile r&eacute; eile den domhan.  N&iacute; g&aacute; ach f&eacute;achaint ar na comhlachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra r&uacute;nda n&oacute; na comhlachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra at&aacute; airgead acu.  N&iacute; raibh cruinnithe board of directors ag na bainc - glacaim leis go raibh siadsan in ann v&oacute;ta a chaitheamh - n&oacute; ag leith&eacute;id&iacute; an UN agus daoine mar sin.  Caithfear d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an trealamh at&aacute; ann anois chun go mbeadh gach rud sl&aacute;n.<\/p>  <p>  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta Alan Farrell, smaoinigh d&aacute; mbeadh an sc&aacute;ile&aacute;n sa Seomra seo briste suas, agus si&uacute;d at&aacute; tinn a bheith marc&aacute;ilte.  Bh&iacute; Comhalta&iacute; tinn n&oacute; fi&uacute; ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is nach raibh in ann freastail ar an D&aacute;il.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an deis acu, m&aacute;s g&aacute;, v&oacute;ta a chaitheamh &oacute; lasmuigh den institi&uacute;id seo n&oacute; go mbeadh duine &eacute;igin in ann seasamh isteach ar a son.  I bParlaimint na hEorpa, t&aacute; liosta ann nuair a t&aacute;thar ag seasamh sa toghch&aacute;in agus, m&aacute;s g&aacute; &eacute;ir&iacute; as, tagann duine eile isteach.  Ar na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la, m&aacute;s g&aacute; &eacute;ir&iacute; as is f&eacute;idir le duine &eacute;igin eile teacht isteach mar substitute n&oacute; i gcomharba ar an t&eacute; at&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as.  N&iacute;l aon bhealach againne &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute;l Comhalta&iacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute;ir&iacute; as an su&iacute;och&aacute;n m&aacute; t&aacute;thar i bp&aacute;irt&iacute; beag n&oacute; m&aacute; t&aacute; str&oacute; ar an gceantar toisc go gcaillfidh an p&aacute;irt&iacute; an su&iacute;och&aacute;n.  Mar sin, t&aacute; ualach sa bhreis ar dhaoine bheith anseo.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; an smaoineamh seo i gceart ach caithfimid an chuid praitici&uacute;il a oibri&uacute; amach.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag dul go dt&iacute; an pobal ag lorg v&oacute;ta air seo, n&iacute;or cheart go dteipf&iacute; air seo mar cuirfeadh s&eacute; sin siar muid.  Theip ar reifreann a bh&iacute; beagnach na p&aacute;irtithe uilig taobh thiar de roimhe seo nuair a chuaigh muid go dt&iacute; an pobal.  Caithimid d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil na freagra&iacute; againn, go dtuigimid conas mar a oibr&iacute;onn s&eacute; agus nach bhfuil s&eacute; ag cur as don tsl&iacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh Teachta&iacute; ag caitheamh v&oacute;ta&iacute;, ach amh&aacute;in in amanna eisceacht&uacute;la nuair at&aacute; siad tinn, i mh&aacute;ithreachais, i dtuismitheoireachta n&oacute; a leith&eacute;id.<\/p>  <p>  Taca&iacute;m leis an mBille.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nd&eacute;anfar bogadh air go tapa go mbeimid in ann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na fadhbanna bun&uacute;sacha eile sa Bhunreacht at&aacute; ag cur i gcoinne daoine de gach inscne a bheith anseo.  Beidh an Bunreacht n&iacute;os nua-aimseartha toisc a leith&eacute;id de leas&uacute; seo.  Seo t&uacute;s, taca&iacute;m leis agus m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir linn aon chabhair a thabhairt chun go mbeidh s&eacute; tr&iacute;d na D&aacute;la chomh tapa agus is f&eacute;idir agus amach ansin leis an gcuid eile den reachta&iacute;ocht do reifrinn at&aacute; ag teacht, tac&oacute;idh muid leis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000054#EEE00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1644513900,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It has been a very interesting debate.  I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  There have been personal reflections by Members who have been here many years and who have spoken of their own difficulties.  The D&aacute;il as it currently sits is not one that is inclusive or aligned with something to which we can expect to attract people.  As Deputy Bacik mentioned, increased female participation is really important.  All parties have an obligation to drive that forward.  I think we will see progress on that at the next general election but we must make the workings of our Parliament far more inclusive in all aspects.  Many of the stories we have heard today show how it deters many when they see the inner workings of these Houses.  There is a cross-party approach and the Ceann Comhairle has established good structures to progress many matters.  We have seen the evolution of that with this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Remote working is one element of a wider agenda in making the Oireachtas a more family-friendly and inclusive workplace.  As others have mentioned, as well as this Bill there are many recommendations from the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament and from the Citizens' Assembly.  The new Joint Committee on Gender Equality that Deputy Bacik chairs will also play an important role in seeing how we can mould the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly into tangible policy outcomes.  It is important and positive that is being progressed now.<\/p>  <p>  There are strong commitments in the programme for Government to develop supports and alternatives for Oireachtas Members to take parental leave.  One of the forum's recommendations was something that the Ceann Comhairle spoke about, namely aligning sittings around school holidays which has been a difficulty for Deputies and Senators over a long period.  We did not align the sitting calendars and that made things very difficult for some Members.  My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, has already started to progress discussions with Members on how we might best improve family-friendly policies in these Houses.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that there is significant momentum behind the proposals for a more family-friendly and inclusive Parliament.  While the matters are complex, and, as highlighted this evening, involve different competing constitutional obligations, I believe it is up to all of us to work together to come up with workable solutions which may or may not involve legislative or constitutional change.  I look forward to future discussions on the issues raised in this legislation and thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for her work in progressing this matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000054#EEE00400","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1644514500,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and indeed all Deputies who came and participated in this debate.  I greatly appreciate their interest, support and contribution.  I especially thank them for the personal reflections they brought to the House.  To reflect on one's own experience is not always an easy thing to do, particularly in a forum like this, but it does help tell those stories about why it is important.  We tell the stories of our constituents, but to advance and evolve our democracy it is important to sometimes reflect on the personal experiences we have had.  There is absolutely no point in coming in, pulling up the ladder and pretending it is easy to be here when it is not.  We need to be honest with people and say we do it, we see these issues, we face the challenges, we get on and we try to fix them but we do it anyway and they can too.  This is all about trying to bring more people into this Chamber, trying to be more inclusive and reaching out further and further.<\/p><p>We have had a very good parliamentary structure that has served us extremely well but our democracy is essentially always incomplete.  There is always more to do and more that can be improved upon.  It is naturally incomplete if half the population is not represented here in a reasonable way over time.  That has never been the case and we need to take the steps we can to get to that point.  Democracy, and our institutions of democracy, must keep pace with our need to reflect the will of our people and the things that are important to them.  Where we find barriers we must take steps to try to address them.  This is simply an effort to do that.  I recognise how complex it is.  I recognise the read-across constitutionally.  I recognise the academic debate around it, that is, whether it is necessary, the read-across on the questions of parliamentary privilege and how that is linked.  Deputy Howlin also mentioned that to me.  It is, of course, part of the same conversation.  My effort is to try to begin to tackle that initial barrier and ask what is it, at its core, that we must be here for that is perhaps a barrier to maternity, paternity and sick leave.  The answer is, of course, voting.  I hope nobody would take from this that I do not see it as important to be here.  Being here and standing here is the privilege of my professional career.  It is so enjoyable.  It is such a privilege to be able to participate, to vote, to be part of the parliamentary structure and to serve constituents.  At the same time, I recognise that for the institutions to evolve and become stronger and better and for more people to come easily into those structures they must be questioned, challenged and helped to evolve as time goes on.  As the Minister of State, Deputies Bacik, &Oacute; Snodaigh and others have said, these things must happen together.  There is a confluence of events at the moment that requires, as Dr. Catherine Day said at the citizens' assembly, real seismic change around some of these issues.  There is that opportunity but only if we take those points and run with them.<\/p><p>I noted what Deputy Richmond mentioned about the poll on <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>, which is interesting.  Of course, it is easy to give a quick reaction to something like that, such as a quick question on whether you are in favour of or against something.  The Deputy was talking about some of the comments on it.  It is hard to see some of those and think people might believe we do not really want to do the work or that we are not very happy to be here.  Of course we are.  It is not about making life easier for politicians.  It is about opening up the Parliament to more people and making it easier for them to be here.  It is about opening up rather than trying to protect or serve ourselves.<\/p><p>We have had separate conversations about the need for more female representation and very strong debates on that to the effect that there must be more women in politics and that women in politics must be facilitated, and there was the debate around the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the particular challenges she faced as a Cabinet Minister.  That is all very well but when one brings these measures to try to realise some of that ambition, and indeed when they are brought forward by women such as myself or Deputy Bacik as part of the committee or Dr. Day as part of the assembly, rationally, it is important those be supported or at least discussed in a serious way as steps.  That is the debate we have had here.  I greatly welcome it.  It was a genuinely positive debate about an effort to be constructive.  We will see how we can take it forward through Committee Stage.  There is more debate to be had about the wording.  I understand the complexity of that, including the concerns around the Attorney General and the read-across about other issues.  Those are debates we can have and are open to having.  I thank Members for facilitating the debate, for participating and for being as encouraging and supportive as they have been.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021000055#FFF00100","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644514500,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644514500,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ag 6.05 p.m. go dt&iacute; 2 p.m., D&eacute; M&aacute;irt, an 15 Feabhra 2022.\r\n\r\nThe D&aacute;il adjourned at at 6.05 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 February 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
