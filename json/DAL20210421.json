The crisis demands an emergency response.  Over recent months, Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have met representative bodies and front-line community and voluntary mental health services throughout the State.  We met those on the front line who provide mental health supports such as family resource centres, addiction centres, youth services and suicide prevention organisations, among others.  They are working over capacity and have had to adapt their services to meet the demand.  They have done this with little support from the Government.  This is not sustainable; they need and deserve support.  We also met national mental health organisations that stated that the inability of people to access mental health supports when they need it was at a critical level.<\/p><p>In February, the Taoiseach announced &euro;10 million in funding that will be made available to meet increased demand for mental health supports.  Front-line mental health services we have met will see very little of this money, and based on previous announcements, I have no confidence the money will reach the groups that really need it.  We have been here before with this Government: big announcements about mental health, with very little substance.  We were in a crisis in mental health provision pre-Covid, but the impacts of Covid have put us in a mental health emergency.  Mental health services are experiencing unprecedented demand for mental healthcare.  Many people using mental health services are doing so for the first time, and too many of them are being left out in the cold as services are just not there to meet the demand.  This is a really frightening place to be.  This increase is set against excessive pre-pandemic waiting lists for care, and the result is the perfect storm we are now experiencing.<\/p><p>Our already under-resourced mental health services, which were struggling to cope pre-Covid, are now operating over capacity.  This is also not sustainable.  Speaking at a meeting of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the CEO of the Mental Health Commission told members our mental health system is not fit for purpose and is out of date.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to change this.  It is unacceptable that in a year of national crisis, the Government chose not to increase investment in mental health in proportion to the overall health budget.  We need to tackle the issue of mental health in a real and sustainable way, with a roadmap for capacity-building in the system.  Right now, what we need more than anything else is an emergency response to the crisis we are currently in.  This is what the motion sets out to do through a series of commonsense and practical proposals that, if implemented now, will make a real difference in the lives of people who are struggling.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a significant emergency investment in mental health care for a six to 12-month period to allow for the provision of surge capacity by private practitioners who will provide urgent and immediate care.  This emergency provision will address the issue of waiting lists and meet immediate demand through the provision of private care, thereby giving the public system the breathing space it needs to increase capacity for the long term.<\/p> <p> Alongside this emergency provision, Sinn F&eacute;in recommends measures to be put in place which will have a positive long-term impact on mental health services.  One of the measures specified in the motion is the provision of an emergency talk therapy fund.  Such a fund would allow people access to an accredited counsellor or therapist on referral from a GP.  The Irish College of General Practitioners has told us that many of its members would even be able to provide this service in their own practices.  It would be a kind of one-stop shop.  This is not aspirational.  It is doable, achievable and realistic.  With the right political will, it could be implemented very quickly.<\/p> <p> We also call for an expansion of capacity in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and primary care mental health services to be meet the demands of the 10,000 children and adults who are waiting on public psychology appointments and the 2,500 children who are waiting for appointments with CAMHS.  This will be achieved through the recruitment of additional psychologists to the public sector.  The Psychological Society of Ireland, which has more than 3,500 members, has publicly endorsed this plan.  It has said there is capacity within its ranks to provide these services.  There would be no more long waiting lists and people would have the ability to access services when needed.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in would also remove the GP visit and medical card accessibility barriers to deliver universal access to counselling.  We have been calling for this for a long time and have fully costed it in our alternative budget.  As I said to the Minister of State before, one of the major gaps in the service relates to those who have a mental health emergency outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  At present, there is no State-wide provision of 24-7 crisis services at the community level.  People must have access to mental health treatment as and when they need it.  We aim to establish a 24-7 mental health crisis de-escalation team.  Our proposal reflects a similar pilot scheme under way in the North.  As we know, mental health issues do not occur only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., nor do they take a break at the weekend.  This ambulance would include a mental health nurse who would call to the person who is having a mental health issue in the community.  This nurse would then triage and treat the person before referring and bringing that person to an appropriate service.  This would be a start in delivering 24-7 care.<\/p> <p> From the outset of the latest lockdown, I have called on the Minister for Health to extend surge capacity in private hospitals to include acute care for mental health.  The latest response I have was received last Friday and states that the HSE is currently in a tendering process with private mental health operators.  We are more than a year into this pandemic and we are still in negotiations.  This is not good enough and needs to change now.  Mental health can no longer be the Cinderella of the health services.<\/p> <p> One group of people who urgently need emergency treatment comprises those suffering from eating disorders.  There are only three beds in the public sector for adults seeking treatment for eating disorders.  This is not good enough.  More beds could be provided as part of this surge capacity.  Parents have told me that they are watching their adult children die before their eyes.  I have spent all week on the phone talking to parents.  In their words, community care is non-existent.  We have heard the Government rhetoric that we are all in this together.  Today is the Minister of State's chance to prove this.  I ask that the Minister of State and all Deputies, regardless of party, get behind this motion and give it support so that people can get the care they need when and where they need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100003#A00200","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618996200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Ward on identifying the need to bring this motion before the D&aacute;il and on the work that has gone into compiling it.  The measures he is bringing to the House are proposed as a six to 12-month emergency response to the needs that are building in our society, a society which has traditionally been served by an underfunded mental health sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have been speaking to community and voluntary organisations and individuals about mental health service provision in my county of Tipperary, and this is what they are saying.<\/p> <p>The State is relying heavily on the community and voluntary sectors.  Yet in many cases, the funding provided to those sectors is meagre and short-term, like for three to six months.  This tight and short-term view on the part of the Government means that many of these organisations spend inordinate amounts of time applying for the next funding allocation.  It also means that some of these organisations remain uncertain as to whether the supports they provide now will be available to them and their clients in a few months' time.  The Government must take note of this and act.<\/p> <p> In a survey on mental health services in Tipperary, I have been told that the main obstacles in getting the help people need are as follows.  First, there is a lack of services.  Second, there is a lack of information about the availability of these services.  Third, there is difficulty in travelling or getting supports nearby.  The Government also needs to understand how much out-of-hours support services are needed and how stressful and upsetting it is for someone who is feeling suicidal to have to wait in an accident and emergency department for hours because of a lack of alternative out-of-hours services.  What should also be of particular concern to this Government is that 48% of those who replied to us had been waiting more than six months for a mental healthcare appointment.<\/p> <p> We are facing a crisis.  I have been told of the following difficulties: people encountering different psychologists at each appointment; how travelling from south Tipperary to St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny is proving difficult for many and is a deterrent for others; how children with special needs are being left behind; how the families of people in need are left dealing with their loved ones alone; how the mental health aspect of addiction is largely ignored; and how the ongoing housing crisis is having a profound impact on people&rsquo;s mental well-being.  It is hard to believe that amid an unprecedented crisis, there has been no increase in the proportion of funding mental health services get from the overall health budget.  We cannot just accept things like growing waiting lists for CAMHS services.  That is why we are proposing to expand capacity in CAMHS and primary care mental health services.<\/p> <p> This motion provides for additional counselling and therapy sessions, as well as removing medical card accessibility barriers to counselling in primary care.  I urge everyone here to support this motion today.  Every family in this country deserves it.  After that, however, we need long-term ambitions that can be acted upon immediately.  If that is beyond the capability of this Government, maybe it is time for another one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100004#B00200","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618996800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>There is not a family in this State that has not been affected by mental health and, sadly, far too many families have also been impacted by the lack of mental health services available in this State.  That lack of services has failed far too many of our people and sadly we have lost far too many people as a result.  Make no mistake about it, mental health can turn to personal tragedy and it is incumbent on us to help our people and save lives.  This crisis has been exacerbated by Covid-19 and we need an emergency response.  Today's motion, brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Ward, is such a response.  It is a complete and compassionate response that offers practical solutions.  This is a real emergency and we need to act.<\/p><p>Sadly, my home city of Galway has also suffered greatly from this lack of services.  I have conducted an anonymous survey to hear people&rsquo;s experiences of this.  One response that stuck out was from a person who said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI see a different nurse or doctor every single time I have an appointment.  They don&rsquo;t have accurate knowledge of one&rsquo;s individual case and therefore do not have much to offer in the way of useful support.  I am repeatedly told to take walks and meditate when in actuality I need a therapist, I need eating disorder services (that don&rsquo;t exist).  I need trauma support. <\/blockquote>  <p>The list goes on.  I have spoken with people who have needed mental health services and with different organisations and one message comes back loud and clear.  They say that we need 24-hour mental healthcare.  The lack of care outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. reflects an attitude of a bygone age.  We need better than that.  Mental health challenges are 24-7, so our response needs to be 24-7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100005#C00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1618996800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I acknowledge this important motion brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Ward.  We all know how Covid has taken its toll on mental health.  Speaking to parents and young people, every one of them says they are in varying degrees of stress and anxiousness.  Children have been missing their sports for more than a year.  That void has had a huge impact on their mental health and placed increased stress on their siblings and parents.  People who otherwise would have had good mental health are struggling and those who were previously struggling are in distress.<\/p>  <p>  I heard William Cummings, who does fantastic work with the Be Aware Be Safe, BABS, listening service say recently: \"It's only when we listen we truly understand, when we understand we can begin to help.\"<\/p> <p>We need significant investment in non-medical support for talk therapy to reduce the numbers of those with poor mental health from becoming increasingly distressed.  Sinn F&eacute;in would invest &euro;10 million in a talk therapy fund, which would create 128,000 sessions with accredited counsellors or therapists in the private system for urgent care on referral from a GP.  We would ensure that before individuals are in distress they are able to talk to a professional who engages with them.  This fund and service would be really important and help to prevent individuals from entering emergency services.  This emergency talk therapy fund must be a priority.<\/p> <p> In line with this, there needs to be universal counselling within primary care services so that counselling services are not barred from individuals because they just missed out on qualifying for a medical card.  Sending an individual who is suicidal to an emergency department has clearly not worked because we do not have the required services.  We need to open private hospital care so that pressure is released within the public health system.  I recently read that emergency departments are like ground zero for mental health patients.<\/p> <p> We have one of the lowest proportions of hospital beds for psychiatric care in the developed world and the numbers drop each year.  With every bed that is lost, the threshold to admit someone to hospital must rise.  Patients need to be increasingly sicker before they can be admitted to hospital.  This is 2021.  We have had Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il working together for almost five years and a Fine Gael-led Government before that.  They cannot wash their hands of the mental health emergency we have.  Mental health is not a nine-to-five issue; it is a 24-7 issue and needs to be resourced to reflect this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100005#C00300","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618997400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The past year has seen a global health emergency the likes of which none of us could have imagined.  However, in the midst of this pandemic another health crisis has been spreading through every town and village in the country for which there is no vaccine: the crisis of mental health.  Years of underfunding in the health service in general and the lack of focus on mental health issues in particular have created a backlog that has been exacerbated by this pandemic.  Lockdowns have had a dramatic effect on people's psychological well-being while also limiting the provision of services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  Some 2,500 children are waiting on CAMHS appointments.  Those are merely the children on the waiting lists, not the ones waiting to be assessed.  Almost 9,000 children await primary care psychology treatment, again only the names on the list.  More than 1,500 adults are awaiting primary care psychology treatment with the HSE.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have been engaging with service users, service providers and even youth clubs in counties Longford and Westmeath to get their opinion on the state of mental health services at the moment.  I believe that the motion will offer concrete solutions to that crisis, to deal with it effectively and to meet the growing demand for mental health services.  <\/p>  <p>  A recent survey found that almost 50% of young people under the age of 34 reported being disheartened or down most of the time, which is absolutely terrifying.  We do not want people merely to survive in this country.  We want them to live and to thrive, and there is a marked difference.  <\/p>  <p>  The motion proposes removing barriers relating to medical cards and income tests so that everyone can access these services.  We propose additional resources and new services to both prevent and react to crisis situations; additional child and adult psychologists; acute mental health beds; funding for training for counselling psychologists; talk therapy; preventive measures of working with community groups; and de-escalation training.  Mental health is not nine-to-five and it needs to be met with a service that is not nine-to-five.  These measures are essential if we are to deal with the surge in demand.<\/p> <p>We are nowhere near capacity or where we need to be.  If we do not take urgent measures, more people will suffer and, ultimately, more people will not make it through.  We need to act now and in a manner that ensures that nobody is left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100006#D00200","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618997700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ward for bringing forth this motion today.  I acknowledge the consistent interest of Deputies Ward and Buckley in mental health.  This motion provides me with an opportunity to discuss mental health now and beyond Covid-19, to update the D&aacute;il on the work of my Department, the HSE and the voluntary sector in this area, and to put on the record the work happening on the ground.  I look forward to addressing many of the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  During Covid-19, the Government has focused on reducing infection numbers and ensuring a safe and effective vaccine roll-out.  However, citizens' mental health needs, especially people at risk of or with existing mental health difficulties, remain a priority.  This is demonstrated in the programme for Government and our commitments to developing high-quality, individualised care and supports for all.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the mental health budget was 6.3% of HSE funding.  The apparent reduction to 5.1% in 2021 arises from the vast increase in Covid resourcing for acute services.  The mental health budget has increased by more than &euro;400 million since 2012, from &euro;711 million to in excess of &euro;1.1 billion this year.  This figure does not include funding for mental health supports in other areas of the health system or in such Departments as Social Protection, Justice or Education.  If anything, the figure underestimates State mental health funding.<\/p>  <p>  Of the &euro;50 million increase in mental health this year, &euro;23 million is for implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision.  This will fund an additional 153 staff in community mental health services, including 29 new staff for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams and telehealth hubs, bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution teams.  It will also fund development of the national clinical programmes and models of care, including the talking therapies model of care, which I launched yesterday.  This model of care outlines a collaborative, layered delivery approach as service users commonly move between different service tiers in their healthcare journey.  It has been developed in line with clinical evidence and international best practice and in collaboration with service users, family members and service providers, among others.<\/p>  <p>  I particularly welcome this pillar of the model.  People who use the services and their families and carers are at the heart of our mental health system and must be empowered to be active partners in the design, development and delivery of mental health services.  The model of care will ensure talking therapies are accessible, evidence-based, recovery-oriented, and provide clear pathways for service users, ensuring everyone gets the right support in a timely manner, regardless of their ability to pay or where they live.  The introduction of the model of care is a significant milestone in improving access to, and enhancing the quality of mental health supports, ultimately seeking better outcomes for people using our services.<\/p>  <p>  A significant concern for me is the waiting lists for psychology in primary care, especially the waiting list for children and young people, which has been already raised a number of times in the debate.  I am actively working with the Department and HSE to develop a targeted initiative to reduce significantly the number of under-18s waiting more than 12 months to access these services.  This initiative will supplement the enhanced community care programme, which has an additional &euro;150 million in new development funding for recruitment of more than 2,000 front-line primary care staff to support a new community health network model.<\/p>  <p>  While we do not yet fully understand the effects of Covid-19 on mental health, a range of post-pandemic mental health and psychosocial challenges are likely to arise.  These may persist for months or years afterwards, perhaps compounded by economic impacts.<\/p> <p>Despite this, a negative mental health outcome for our population from the pandemic is not inevitable, if we respond to the challenge in a cohesive manner.<br\/><br\/>Launched in January 2021, the HSE's psychosocial framework provides a co-ordinated, consistent and collaborative approach to the provision of mental health services and supports.  Building on a range of psychosocial supports introduced last year, the framework provides for five key levels, from mental health promotion to specialist services, during and beyond Covid.  Seven-day telehealth services include <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>, the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis text line 50808 and NGO online supports.  These comprise one-to-one counselling and group and peer supports delivered through MyMind and SilverCloud.  MyMind provides free online counselling, in 15 languages, to people in communities nationwide.  Online activity has increased since the introduction and enhancement of these services and there is capacity to cater for upsurges in demand.  In line with the psychosocial framework, the HSE has a range of proactive responses for potential rises in service need, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports.<br\/><br\/>Early in the pandemic, the HSE moved rapidly, under public health guidelines, to continue community mental health services where possible, with digital health models adopted for service user and staff safety.  High-support residential placements have continued.  Overall, specialist mental health services, both community and acute, are operating at 80% to 90% of pre-Covid levels.  While referral rates are below normal, the level of appointments offered in all community services remained consistent with previous years, despite adaptations to service delivery.<br\/><br\/>With a target of 90%, 91.2% of adult accepted referrals were offered an appointment within 12 weeks in 2020.  This compares with 92.9% in 2019.  Similarly, with a 98% target, 96.8% of older people were offered an appointment within 12 weeks by psychiatry of later life teams.  The community target of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, of offering an appointment within 12 weeks was 78% in 2020.  A total of 79.2% of children and young people were offered an appointment within 12 weeks last year, compared with 78.4% in 2019.  These data show the ongoing dedication of mental health services to ensuring service continuity, despite the considerable challenges posed by Covid.  I thank everybody working in mental health services the length and breadth of the country for the work they do on a daily basis.<br\/><br\/>To date, all consenting mental health staff and individuals in residential care have been vaccinated.  Cohort 4, which includes high-risk mental health service users aged 16 to 64 in the community, is under way.  In anticipation of a surge in requirement for mental health hospital beds, the HSE has worked with private hospitals on additional acute and longer-term beds, to free up public capacity.  A total of &euro;13.65 million has been allocated for this purpose.  Of particular note, and taking account of the increased number and acuity of eating disorder presentations, I have secured the availability of &euro;3.94 million to the national clinical programme for eating disorders this year.  This will fund the establishment of three new specialist eating disorder teams and complete the three existing teams.  I am fully committed to ensuring this funding is invested in full in 2021 and will continue thereafter.<br\/><br\/>Since coming to office, I have met many of the key organisations and personnel who deliver services, including HSE corporate staff, community healthcare organisation, CHO, heads of service, clinical leads, healthcare workers, partner NGOs and, importantly, service users and families.  Last week, I met each of the nine CHO mental health leads to examine collective challenges, with a particular focus on CAMHS, improving residential standards and Covid-related challenges.  These issues, and others we covered, are being addressed through Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy, and the HSE service plan.  Sharing the Vision seeks to enhance services across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to specialist supports.  It focuses on outcomes for people using our services, by taking a person-centred approach, and outlines principles of trauma-informed care.<br\/><br\/>In terms of recent developments, I am delighted that the formal handover of the new 170-bed hospital in Portrane to the national forensic mental health service took place in March.<\/p> <p>The HSE is now equipping and commissioning the facility.  This is a major step forward in providing a world-class service.  Another positive step is the establishment this month of a high-level task force to consider the mental health and addiction challenges for people interacting with the criminal justice system.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for raising this motion.  I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify how many of the concerns raised are being or will be addressed.  This motion is not being opposed and much of the content is welcome.  There is no doubt we all seek continued developments across the mental health system, and I am fully committed to working with all Deputies to see this fundamental ambition realised.  I thank mental health service staff and those in the community and voluntary sectors for their immense work and dedication in supporting the mental health needs of people living in Ireland during this challenging time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100007#E00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618998300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Almost six in ten people who responded to the recent Central Statistics Office Social Impact of Covid-19 survey believe Covid-19 has impacted negatively on their mental health and well-being.

These increases are set against excessive pre-pandemic waiting lists for care.  As a result, we have moved from a crisis in mental health to an emergency, with many workers saying there is a tsunami coming at them.  In Wicklow, the waiting time for children to access child and adolescent mental health services is now 12 months.  Service providers I have spoken to say they are under so much pressure that mental health workers are being forced almost to triage patients as they would following a major incident.  In some instances, they are unable to accept children or young people unless they are very serious cases.  Even then, they are forced to pass the children on to other child health services that are not equipped to deal with the severity of the problems.  In turn, those services refer the children back to the GPs and the merry-go-round can recommence.<\/p>  <p>  Some young people are turning to alcohol and smoking weed and other illegal drugs as they think this is the solution.

Mental health services simply cannot manage the numbers of children and young people who need services now, rather than in 12 months' time.  Some teenagers are facing an even worse scenario.  I am aware of situations where, due to the waiting lists, children aged 17 years have been denied appointments because, by the time they get an appointment, they will have become adults.  Yet, at 17 years, they are too young to be placed on an adult waiting list and are simply left with no supports.  We are in a mental health emergency.  We need action now rather than before this situation spirals further out of control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100009#G00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1618998300,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Teachta Mark Ward, Joanna Kelly agus an fhoireann go l&eacute;ir i Sinn F&eacute;in.  I also thank the public health staff, community and voluntary sector workers and those working in family resource centres whom I have spoken to in the past week.  They have spoken of a major increase in demand for services to address issues such as anxiety, drug and alcohol misuse and concerns over sexuality, education, employment, poor self-esteem and behavioural issues.  They mentioned the need for extra outreach community-based staff and upstreaming for those under 18 and over 65 years in particular, where services are practically non-existent.  Were it not for the work of the Kerry Diocesan Youth Service, which works with some of the most vulnerable young people, and the Southwest Counselling Service, there would be little or no prevention, early diagnosis or counselling.<\/p>  <p>  Residential and inpatient services are difficult to secure.  Those I spoke to mentioned the need for funding, which is severely lacking and typically insecure or targeted at a specific area and cannot be used to fulfil demand.  They mentioned the lack of respite care, poor awareness of resources and the need for a multidisciplinary approach.<\/p> <p>The announcement by the HSE last night that a review of 1,500 cases in south Kerry alone regarding the possible over-prescribing of medication for young people is deeply troubling.  Given that two students in an average class are now seen by or referred to CAMHS, we must have confidence that young people are getting the best medical mental health care possible.  Serious questions will arise regarding oversight and how long this was known to the HSE.  While we must wait for the review, we must consider did the lack of the services mentioned by the people that I spoke to in the last week such as the lack of auxiliary services, talk therapies, early  intervention, social work and the lack of home help lead to a rush to chemical intervention.<\/p> <p> The motion calls for a public crisis de-escalation team and an ambulance service in every CHO.  There was but currently there is no day care centre in the town of Tralee where the chronically ill can call in, and a referral centre is not enough.  If someone can attend a primary care centre in a Covid-19-compliant way, why can he or she not attend a day care centre.  One needs to open on a 24-hour basis if the Government are serious.  While GP referrals decreased, there is a concern about a flood of referrals.  I call on the Minister of State to act now and to heed these warnings.  How confident can we be that the requirements of those on the front line will be met when the list forwarded for vaccination and sent from psychiatric services to the vaccine roll-out team one month ago remains unanswered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100009#G00300","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618998600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I was glad the Minister of State said that she was not opposing the motion.  However, there were some things in her speech that were quite alarming if one sits down to think about them.  She said that within 12 weeks somebody will have an appointment.  This is 12 weeks of a family watching a family member in distress with worry and anxiety waiting to get an appointment.  That that is what we have established in this country as the norm is a poor reflection on the health service that we had pre-Covid-19.  Now we have the Covid-19 situation which has exacerbated all of those problems.  I think the Minister of State would acknowledge that but the Government also needs to do so.  The only way we can deal with this is to heavily invest to ensure that we provide for the very significant surge that is going to come and that is practically already there in many cases.<\/p>  <p>   We have people who because of the lockdown and the restrictions feel very stressed and anxious in respect of all of this which will have an impact.  There will also be an impact of  the people who have contracted Covid-19 and we come across them all of the time.  These are people who cannot sleep at night, who have lost energy, and who have great stress in their lives and will undoubtedly present with anxiousness in respect of all of that.  This is a situation that is going to get worse in the coming days and weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  We all need to recognise the system that is there.  In fairness, I have spoken to the Minister of State on many occasions about this, particularly in respect of CAMHS in counties Sligo and Leitrim and on other issues there, where we need to get the investment and the additional people in place.  CAMHS in Sligo-Leitrim is at half-capacity because it is so understaffed.  That has a very significant impact on families across the entire area.  That is not just confined to Sligo-Leitrim but it is the case practically everywhere throughout the country.  We need to put the effort in to deliver on this.<\/p>  <p>  In the past number of days I have spoken to people from various agencies and organisations across my constituency.  I spoke to North West STOP, which is a community organisation that emerged from the community to provide services for suicide prevention.  It gets no funding from Government and yet it is there to stop the gap that Government leaves because of the underfunding of mental health services.  We also see the same situation in respect of the Irish Advocacy Network and the Sligo Centre for Independent Living.  All of these organisations are doing their best to try to assist people who are under stress.

On Monday night, we held a town hall meeting with these people and others to discuss their mental health.  The stories were harrowing.

I wish to raise an issue that is the subject of a report by Shane Phelan in this morning's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  It relates to services in south Kerry and I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of it.  It is a very disturbing report regarding a part of the country that is very close to my heart for personal reasons.  People are sincerely worried about this issue because they do not know the scale of what they will be dealing with.  What is the scale of this issue which has been spotted and with which we will have to deal in terms of dangerous amounts of medication possibly having been given to adolescents and children?  What is the Minister of State aware of in the context of this issue?  When did the HSE become aware of it?<\/p><p>The reply issued to Shane Phelan and quoted in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>today indicates that it will take 16 weeks for an analysis to be carried.  To me, that seems to be an extraordinarily long period for that to be done.  It will be four months of anxiety for many young people, adolescents and their families.  Some of the people in question do not even know they are affected.  I ask the Minister of State to update the House on this issue, please.  It is a very worrying situation.  I am worried about the impacts on the young people in question, but also about how this happened in the first place.  Furthermore, I am now worried about the length of time it will take to get to a first base of an analysis of what happened and what will be done.  I note that the reply from the HSE states, &quot;Most of the children whose files are being reviewed will have received appropriate care and clinical interventions.&quot;  How does the HSE know that is the case?  It does not know the scale of the issue and it does not know what has happened here.  A line like that gives me worry that there was some level of awareness of this issue before it was brought to our attention through the media.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to my questions on this issue.  <\/p><p>On the broader issue of mental health that is before the House, issues relating to mental health are exacerbated by the fact that such an unequal society is developing in this country.  That is at the root of many issues people face, no matter what age group they belong to.  There will be extra issues in the context of service provision as a result of Covid.  It is obvious that such issues are being experienced.  Certain categories of people are particularly impacted, such as younger people and more elderly people.  Younger people are affected by the direct impact on their everyday lives in terms of what they have been going through with regard to education or services.  Elderly people have suffered as a result of isolation and the impact on their social lives towards the end of their lifespan.  As we know a range of other issues will arise, and particularly in light of the high percentage of people who are and will be seeking to access services for the first time, what are the plans of the HSE in this regard?<\/p> <p> A number of people, including the Minister of State, have mentioned waiting times.  It is not good for the Minister of State to be standing up here and referring to patients receiving appointments within 12 weeks.  It is just not good.  That 12 weeks is a benchmark timeline for the provision of services is, frankly, scandalous.  I am not saying the Minister of State is happy about the situation but she said we could get to that timeline.  She has an urgent review and I wish her the best of luck with it but the situation is not good.<\/p> <p> It is obvious we need a catch-up programme.  Will the Minister of State outline what her plans are in that regard across all service provision?  The fundamental problem is we do not have enough professionals, particularly in the public service.  What are the Minister of State's plans to recruit providers of services into the provision of public health?  Wrap-around services that extend beyond the immediate provision of mental health services need to be part of the public health system because otherwise there is a chain that can break down, and often does.  What are the Minister of State's plans to launch a recruitment drive to ensure we can do this?  That is going to take a considerable time because getting people into the public service in a professional capacity can, at times, be difficult.<\/p> <p> That brings to me the issue of the bureaucracy around service provision.  Many people who are looking for services are being forced to go to private providers.  That causes issues and people should not have to go there in the first place.  However, when they do and thereafter must engage with public provision, there is a bureaucratic chain that means there is a breakdown.  That is unacceptable and must be addressed.<\/p> <p> Services need to be provided 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  I do not need to remind the Minister of State of the scandalous situations where people end up waiting in accident and emergency departments at weekends because there is no service provision for them.<\/p> <p> I also have a serious issue relating to information provision.  The process by which we communicate to all the various cohorts, especially young people, needs to be improved dramatically.  The most common cause of death from non-natural causes among 15- to 24-year-olds is suicide.  How we reach out into schools, third level institutions and other forms of social areas in which young people are interacting needs to improve dramatically.  Online outreach needs to improve dramatically because that is where most communication is now necessary.<\/p> <p> Face-to-face counselling and interventions are always the best but I also believe that, in the world in which we live, we must dramatically improve how we reach the people using new technologies.  I would like to see a special focus on that, including the use of video technologies.  That can save time because it can be done at great speed.  It prevents geographical issues and can be done over weekends.  It is important we consider how that technology can be used.<\/p> <p> I have an issue about the organisations under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 and how they are going to be provided with the funding and supports to continue their work.  We all know the State has abdicated certain amounts of geographical or other responsibilities for mental health services, as it has also done in many other sectors.  Organisations, through goodwill, have operated and filled the gaps.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that.  In my town of Nenagh, Carmha has been offering excellent services over recent years because the services required had not been provided.  Carmha is providing fantastic services on addiction and mental health but it is limited to fundraising.<\/p> <p>It is not even a recognised section 38 or 39 organisation.  This should not be the way it is.  It is through sheer goodwill and community support that these services are operating, and Carmha is not alone around the country.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, as regards Covid and how we come out of it, there is one issue we really need to examine.  So many people have changed their lifestyle as regards working from home, the use of technology and the environment in which they work.  That has sometimes brought additional pressures that are not acknowledged.  As part of a holistic approach to how we ensure people's mental health is protected, collectively as a Parliament we must deal with issues concerning working from home.  The working from home legislation, which we in the Labour Party have drafted and proposed, must be introduced to ensure that the always-on culture, which pressurises employees, is addressed, because there is no doubt that such attitudes and behaviour impacts on people way beyond their workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100011#J00300","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618999800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I will share four minutes with Deputy Cairns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100013#L00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1618999800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We have tabled an amendment, which has a specific ask within it.  It is welcome that the Minister of State is not opposing the motion.  My amendment has a very specific ask, that is, that we would have an interdepartmental task force to examine and address youth mental health trauma.  If the Minister of State does not oppose the amendment, I ask that she would take action to deliver upon it because to do otherwise would lead to accusations of being a little bit cute in how we approach this parliamentary engagement.<\/p><p>Our amendment seeks to illuminate the shadow pandemic, which is the wave of trauma, poor mental health and the negative impact and experiences that have been felt by young people all over this country.  The mental health burden associated with the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be profound and to be felt for many years to come.  Today may be one of the final opportunities to speak of what we need and deserve as we start, hopefully, to begin to ascend towards a recovery.  However, recovery will not just be economic and it will not happen by reopening schools alone.  Recovery will happen when we acknowledge the fact that people, in particular young people, have suffered and when we seek to address it but to address it, we must first seek to identify it.  We have not put any budgetary demands in our amendment.  We have not set out exactly what needs to happen; what we have asked for is an interdepartmental task force that includes experts in child and adolescent experiences and children and young people themselves.  Such involvement has been demonstrated by the secondary schools' student union, which campaigned on the leaving certificate and was around the table over the course of weeks and months and able to identify the problem and set a pathway by which we can deliver a solution.<\/p><p>There has been some research into children's experience of traumatic events such as following natural disasters and it indicates long-lasting effects on psychological well-being.  The effects are often greater for those who are most vulnerable.  We cannot unsee the experiences that have been felt.  We have heard about an increase in domestic violence and substance misuse.  The Government has set up task forces for the recovery of the tourism industry and the arts.  Many recovery task forces have been set up and we believe this one is of the most fundamental importance.<\/p><p>While young people are less susceptible to severe Covid-19 infection, they are more at risk in respect of the negative psychosocial effects of the pandemic, including experiencing bereavement due to the deaths of people who have died as a result of Covid, as the age pattern of bereavement does not mirror the age pattern of Covid mortality.  We have seen the closure of school buildings, the loss of extracurricular activities such as sport, music, dance and decreased contact with peers and all that will have a profound effect on young people.<\/p> <p>Simply to offer words is simply to offer tokenism that will lead to nothing unless we deliver meaningful actions.<\/p> <p> To be very clear, none of us knows the extent of the problem.  We can talk about it and say there is a wave of youth mental health trauma but we do not know the full extent of it, and we cannot unless we begin to try to engage with and peer into it.  For example, we do not know how many young people have disengaged from education during the pandemic.  We do not know how many children or young people are struggling with their mental health due to issues that have been amplified by or are a result of the pandemic.  We do not know how many children or young people have had adverse childhood experiences over the past 14 months.<\/p> <p> There have been well documented shadow pandemics of domestic violence and increased alcohol consumption and violence in the home, which may result in serious emotional and behavioural problems in the future.  We have known all of this anecdotally, but we do not have the figures or a pathway to identify the extent of the problem.<\/p> <p> In March 2021 the national clinical programme for eating disorders experienced a 66% increase in referrals compared with 2020, one in four of which was deemed to be urgent.  Yet, just three of the 16 proposed community teams for those suffering from eating disorders have been established.  That is simply unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Our amendment also highlights outstanding commitments in the national youth mental health task force in 2017, including the pathfinder unit which I added to the amendment to the motion to expedite its implementation.  This previous task force does not answer the extent of trauma emerging from Covid.  We need a task force that is interdepartmental and with expert voices to assess the extent of need and create a trauma-informed recovery plan.  The phrase \"trauma-informed\" is probably the most important aspect of what we are asking for.<\/p> <p> Speaking to the Northern Ireland Assembly committee for health in March 2021, interim mental health champion Professor Siobh&aacute;n O'Neill spoke of the need for a trauma-informed recovery plan to address the stress and trauma caused by the pandemic.  The phrase \"trauma-informed\" recognises that while our well-being can be impacted by our normal emotional responses to what has happened over the past year, for most of us the pandemic will not have caused increased trauma or mental illness.  It also recognises that several population groups have been disproportionately affected and have suffered very real trauma, which comes on top of previous traumas.  These are the groups we need to target in our preventative interventions and treatments, if treatments are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100013#L00400","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619000400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ward for tabling this motion.  Put simply, we cannot continue to ignore the reality of mental illness.  We do not tolerate waiting lists for passports, driving licences or, indeed, vaccinations.  Yet, for mental health treatment, waiting lists are normal and accepted.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. John Farrelly, chief executive of the Mental Health Commission, last month identified the issue at the centre of today&rsquo;s motion.  The pandemic has highlighted the results of continued underinvestment in our mental health services: increased waiting lists, an over-reliance on GPs and communities to provide care, and assigned money going unspent.<\/p>  <p>  Thanks to figures secured by the Social Democrats co-leader, Deputy Shortall, we know that, as of December, 2,736 children are waiting on an appointment with community CAMHS.  That includes 448 in the Cork-Kerry region, with 98 children and adolescents waiting more than a year.  Unfortunately, the HSE does not have national data on waiting lists for adults and older adult mental health teams, which is an issue in itself.<\/p>  <p>  This motion articulates many of the major issues in the State&rsquo;s response to mental health, especially at a time when community and voluntary front-line services are experiencing an unprecedented demand for mental health services.  There are two particular issues which I want to focus on today.<\/p>  <p>  In February, I raised the shocking situation whereby no funding was allocated under the national eating disorder treatment plan for 2020 and none of the &euro;1.6 million allocated in 2019 was spent.  Responses to my parliamentary questions revealed the decision to pause temporarily the nationally planned development of eating disorder services was made for operational rather than clinical reasons and that funding was diverted to meet existing demands to provide additional clinical supports such as agency staffing.  We need clear assurances this will not happen again.  Bureaucratic decisions cannot be allowed to affect the treatment of vulnerable groups.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Gannon, has tabled an amendment to ensure dedicated, ring-fenced funding for eating disorders annually and to ensure a community eating disorder team is deployed in every community healthcare organisation area.  I ask all Members to support this vital amendment.<\/p>  <p>  In February, I also highlighted the fact eating disorders, which disproportionately present among young women, are among the psychiatric conditions most associated with mortality.<\/p>  <p>The Minister of State assured me then that she was aware of the issues and was working with HSE clinical programme leaders to spend the money this year.  However, in the meantime there has been several cases of young women having difficulties accessing appropriate medical care for severe eating disorders.  These cases indicate that there is still a significant gap between the Government&rsquo;s intentions and healthcare services on the ground for people who need them.  The HSE currently provides three inpatient beds for eating disorders.  People who desperately need care simply cannot get it.  If the Minister of Sate has not read the piece in the <i>Evening Echo <\/i>on one woman's experience, I hope that she will today.  I beg her to please intervene and do something about this.<br\/><br\/>Second, I want to raise counselling services.  The system of professional low-cost community-based counselling services in Ireland has had its funding cut by 50% since 2011.  These are front-line community, voluntary and non-profit agencies who have continued to deliver counselling through the pandemic.  State agencies, including Tusla, CAMHS, and the Garda, often refer people to these counselling services, yet their funding does not reflect the crucial role they play.  This sector represents incredible value for money.  In 2018, member organisations of the Association of Agency-based Counselling &amp;amp; Psychotherapy in Ireland provided more than 70,000 hours of therapy for &euro;2.8 million.  This community-based, not-for-profit sector needs its funding restored, and needs a commitment to multi-annual funding.  In addition, the Government must make a commitment to review the current model of funding of sections 38 and 39 Tusla-funded organisations.<br\/><br\/>I presume the motion&rsquo;s call for an emergency talk therapy fund for sessions in the private system will allow for funding to go to the community-based, not-for-profit sector also.  If one of the proposers could clarify that in their closing statement, it would be appreciated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100014#M00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619001000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Ward and Sinn F&eacute;in on this motion on mental health.  I am sure everyone agrees that we are living in unprecedented times, which call for unprecedented measures, especially around our mental and physical well-being.  The past 14 months has shown us that we are all vulnerable and we can be touched by any mental health issue.  It has shown the desperate situations in which people have found themselves in experiencing isolation, fear, loneliness and despair, but there is also hope which is the main thing we want the debate.  We have seen amazing human solidarity not only in Ireland but across the world, particularly with our front-line workers.  We have seen hope, unity and togetherness that we have not seen for generations as people pulled together.  When people pull together and there is a sense of togetherness, that is great for everyone's mental and physical health.  That is good but we need to be better.<\/p>  <p>  A Vision for Change was quite visionary in 2006.  It was a critique of mental health services in Ireland.  What we are discussing here is resources.  That strategy said we needed to spend 12% of our overall health budget on mental health services.  We spend less than that now.  Mental Health Reform says there are fewer staff working in mental health services now than in 2008 even though a lot of money has gone into mental and physical health.  When there are fewer staff, there are fewer resources.  Intervention is key when someone presents themselves with difficulties.  It is very important that the Government addresses that.<\/p>  <p>  Others have spoken about CAMHS.  In certain CHOs - my constituency is in CHO 7 - some children have to wait up to a year and a half before they can avail of any sort of intervention service.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely unforgivable in that children need the intervention not in 18 months or even 12 weeks but in 12 days.  Addressing this need is the key to changing fundamentally our CAMH services and so forth.<\/p> <p> The pandemic has shown there have been major inadequacies regarding public health services and a schism.  Throughout numerous decades, the underfunding of our health service, particularly the mental health service, has been hugely detrimental for those who wanted to access services.  Some of us may need to access the services, and when we need them, they are not there for us.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State answer a question on talk therapy?  It is very good.  There is overprescription of medication, especially antidepressants, for mental health issues in this country.  Nobody has mentioned social prescribing.  It is very beneficial and we should do more of it rather than going down the line of overmedicating people.  Social prescribing is going to be very beneficial.<\/p> <p> On the overall picture, I really believe, for numerous reasons, there is a mental health crisis.  That society is so driven by competition is absolutely detrimental to people.  That is a political analysis but we live in a capitalist world that is driven by competition, individualism and profit.

People are waiting many months and sometimes for more than a year to get the services.  Indeed, they do not get them at all in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  Two thousand five hundred children are waiting for CAMH services and 8,893 children are waiting for primary care psychology.  As of January 2021, 3,345 adults have been waiting for counselling treatment.  There is a lack of 24-7 emergency services.  Reports indicate the effects of the lack of services, staff and so on.  There is a report in one newspaper today &mdash; I have heard many stories of this &mdash; that refers to the overmedicating of children to compensate for the lack of psychology services, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy.  These problems become worse because there is no early intervention.  Without assessment and services at a young age, these problems become intractable, permanent problems that cost the individuals affected far more when they get older and cost our society in general far more.<\/p>  <p>  The point on eating disorders has been made by others.  My office was talking to one of the young women whose story has been circulated.  Her eating disorder is so severe and she is begging to get into hospital but you literally cannot do so unless you are at death's door or have the money to go private.  Shockingly, millions of euros are allocated but not actually spent.   The money for eating disorder services, not having been spent initially, has been suspended.  The point I want to make on all this, which others have rehearsed, is that there is a desperate, urgent need for these services that has been magnified by Covid, resulting in a 66% increase in eating disorders, for example.<\/p> <p>What do we need to address these issues?  We need trained professionals.  One would think, given the desperate need for these services, that we would be doing everything to train professionals.<\/p> <p> I made this point to the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago in regard to psychologists in particular.  Are we making it easier for people to become qualified and to get doctorates in psychology?  No, quite the opposite.  We are making it very difficult, with MA fees of between &euro;8,000 and &euro;15,000, such that many people who study for MA degrees do so in the Netherlands because it is cheaper to do it there.  Then, when a student has got through that, he or she has to complete a certain number of placement hours, which is very difficult to do, and there is the cost of travelling on placement, which may be unpaid such as in the case of student nurses and midwives.  If someone wants to study for a doctorate in counselling and educational psychology, there is no funding whatsoever.  Students have to pay &euro;15,000 in fees per year for three years and work an unpaid placement, which is nearly full time, as well as doing all the study, seeing clients and so on.  People who are trying to study educational and counselling psychology are living in poverty and many of them drop out.  About 45% of students training to be psychologists say they want to leave the country altogether, such are the horrendous conditions.<\/p> <p> In clinical psychology, there is some funding but the number of places is pathetic.  In 2020, there were 52 placements for doctorates in psychology, with hundreds of students who have undergraduate degrees, MA degrees and loads of training under their belt chasing only 52 places.  They cannot get on the courses because there are not enough places.  Furthermore, there are 402 fewer psychologists than was recommended in A Vision for Change in 2006.  We are not putting the resources into supporting young people who want to become psychologists and to help address the mental health crisis.  We are making it difficult for them and we are grossly understaffed and under-resourced to meet the desperate needs that exist in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100016#O00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619001600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>We have tabled amendment No. 1 to the motion.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has played havoc with the mental health of people of all ages.  The brightest glimmer of light we have is the Covid vaccine.  At present, the vaccine roll-out is gathering pace and a consistent supply of vaccines seems guaranteed.  This should be a time of optimism, but almost every day the media have a story of conflict, confusion or contradiction.  This undermines public confidence.  Releasing vague information on undecided issues is doing a grave and unhealthy disservice to people.  It causes unnecessary worry and anxiety.  It is a practice that should be curtailed<\/p>  <p>  Every age group has suffered during the past year.  Only the very strongest have escaped some form of damage to their mental health.  Loss has been the biggest factor: loss of a loved one, of a job, of companionship, of social activities, of education and, for all, of freedom.  The closure of schools has led to many health conditions.  Children have missed out on personal contact with their friends, family members, classmates, teachers and school communities.  The impact of trauma due to this pandemic and the lack of supports available is affecting children's academic, emotional and behavioural development.  A total of 2,550 children and young people are awaiting access to CAMHS, while almost 9,000 children are awaiting primary care psychology treatment.  These numbers are increasing at an alarming rate.  Our younger generation has been through the type of trauma that previously did not exist.  They have watched their parents struggle, their independence vanish.  The pandemic has forced teens to be removed from normal social, physical and educational interactions.  It is estimated that one in three adolescents will match the criteria for an anxiety disorder by the age of 18.  This is a shocking and very worrying prediction.<\/p>  <p>  We can learn from international best practice.  Many trauma-informed school strategies and restorative practices that address chronic stress and build resilience in our children can be implemented in schools.  The Minister for Education should provide the necessary training and supports and be ready to implement these strategies in September.  We need a cross-party, cross-departmental and interdisciplinary approach to address mental health issues and access to supports and services.  The Government must address the long-term effects of stress and trauma caused by this pandemic.  It must initiate and implement policies and actions to counteract the mounting pressures on young people.  Our personal ability to recover from this pandemic lies in the strength of our mental health, and the strength of our mental health lies in the support we receive.  The Government must not be found wanting in providing that support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100017#P00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1619001600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  I thank those responsible for bringing it before the House and raising this very important issue.  I have long advocated that mental health needs to be treated more seriously.  Time and again, we hear those in government talk about the challenges of tackling mental health and the many actions they will bring to deal with the issue.  The truth is that the Government is not taking the issue seriously enough.  Mental health issues, particularly among our younger generation, is getting worse.  Stress, anxiety and fear are growing among our younger generation and we must put in place measures that will prevent this from getting worse.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the motion before the House, I support my colleagues in the Regional Group, who have tabled an amendment that my colleagues will address.  The statistics are truly shocking.  At present, 2,551 children and young people are awaiting child and adolescent mental health services and, shockingly, 8,893 children are awaiting primary care psychological treatment.  In addition, 1,553 adults are awaiting primary care psychological treatment from the HSE.  These are shocking statistics of which we must all be ashamed.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organization recommends that a minimum of 14% of a country's overall health budget be allocated to mental health challenges, while Sl&aacute;intecare recommends a minimum mental health budget of 10%.  The Government's spend on mental health in 2020 accounted for only 5.2% of the overall health budget, almost two thirds less than what is recommended by the World Health Organization.  Will the Government please explain this?  The bottom line is waiting lists for mental health services prior to Covid were at crisis levels and, to put it mildly, are now at emergency levels.  The Mental Health Commission even told the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that Ireland's mental healthcare system is not fit for purpose and is out of date and, furthermore, that substantial additional investment is needed to address this.  The bottom line is we need to act now.<\/p>  <p>  I have dealt with numerous issues with the Crosslanes centre in Drogheda and we have seen at first hand how inadequate this service is.  It is simply not fit for purpose.  The Minister of State stated that mental health difficulties remain a priority.  The HSE website states that one in four people will experience some mental health difficulties in his or her lifetime, that mental health treatment will usually come from one's GP and that mental health services must be provided via a referral from a GP.  Doctors need help.  A doctor in Dundalk referred a patient numerous times to the Crosslanes centre and the patient was sent back each time.  The doctor could not do any more and the patient needed someone with more experience.  That young person ultimately committed suicide.  Will the Minister of State please investigate what is happening in Crosslanes?  The building was completed in 2016 and looks fantastic.  People in the area need help.  Will the Minister of State please look into the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100017#P00300","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1619001600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward the motion, which I will support as well as our amendment, tabled by the Regional Group.

I commend the medical staff in Wexford who deal with mental health, particularly those in CAMHS and at Wexford General Hospital, who are all under severe pressure because of the staffing levels and the inadequate resources received.  I thank the Minister of State for her intervention on Monday last in a very serious situation that arose, one we should not be dealing with in emergency cases.  I thank her and the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, who, while his intervention was not required, tried to address the matter.<\/p> <p>There is no child psychologist in the CAMHS unit in Arden House in Wexford.  This has been the case for three years.  The Minister has informed me that a child psychologist is about to be appointed.  There are two applicants for this position, which has been vacant for more than three years.  Neither of these applicants has yet been formally offered the position, allowing them to either accept or reject the offer.  This leaves us in limbo.  The children and families of Wexford are being let down by what seems to be a lack of administrative engagement in making an offer to these two applicants.  I ask the Minister of State and all of her party colleagues in Government to address that issue.  They should make someone in the HSE accountable for making an offer so that children in Wexford will no longer be disregarded and left without a child psychologist.<\/p> <p> We have heard many Deputies talk today about the increased incidence of anorexia.  Wexford has seen a serious increase but there is no paediatric dietician attached to either the hospital or to CAMHS.  I am informed we are entitled to half a dietician.  I ask that this be reviewed.  Nobody should have to deal with half a dietician.  The CAMHS team has acknowledged there has been an increase.  Instead of half a dietician being appointed to Waterford and half a dietician to Wexford, I ask that this be reviewed because a full-time dietician is required in each area.  I ask the Minister of State to treat this as a matter of urgency.  Both situations need to be addressed.  The Government cannot continue to launch campaigns without providing the staff required to allow them to meet the needs of the people.

I will highlight one special thing to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the other Minister of State, although Deputy Butler would have an advantage in this regard as she was very good in fighting the abortion Bill which affected unborn babies.<\/p>  <p>  The Saint John of God group has been operating a very valuable service in St. Mary of the Angels in mid-Kerry, which has been looking after children with mental and physical disabilities since 1965.  The property was donated free of charge to the Franciscan Sisters by the Doyle family in 1965.  The congregation operated it up until 2005 when it was handed over to the Saint John of God group.  This group is now giving up saying that, as it was not properly funded by the HSE, it cannot continue.  A rumour has gone out, however, that the property will now be sold by the Saint John of God group.  It would be particularly hurtful to the patients in the centre and their parents if it was to be sold.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure it is never sold and that it will be kept by the HSE, or whatever Department or group is put in charge, when the Saint John of God group gives up at the end of the year.  There are 64 patients in the centre at present in addition to the trained staff who look after them.

It is very important.  There is going to be a look back with regard to 1,500 children who were under the care of CAMHS in Kerry.  I have a number of questions for the HSE.  When did it become aware of the overmedication of children receiving care from CAMHS?  How long did it take to notify the parents of these children?  How long will the look back take and what measures will be put in place to make sure a situation like this never arises again?<\/p>  <p>  I will also raise the situation in respect of the St. Mary of the Angels home in Beaufort in County Kerry because it has to do with different types of both mental and physical health.  I have been a lifelong supporter of the service, first of all as a representative of the Killorglin electoral area for many years when I worked daily with the parents from around Kerry and beyond who have availed of the excellent service provided in St. Mary of the Angels.  To be very clear, St. Mary of the Angels is a centre of excellence when it comes to taking care of people's mental, intellectual and physical problems and difficulties.  There are parents and families who dearly appreciate the care they have been getting there.  There is a worry in County Kerry that the centre is going to be closed down by stealth.  This worry arises from the fact that new admissions to the centre are not being allowed.  It is a beautiful facility.  I know every single solitary one of the staff members who work there and their families.  It is a vocation for them, and was a vocation for those before them, to take care of the residents of that home.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has a policy of not allowing congregated settings and that one shoe fits all sizes.  It believes it is good for people to be taken out of this centre of excellence and to be put out into the community, but that is not necessarily so.  It can actually be bad for them.  I am pleading on my knees for the Government not to allow St. Mary of the Angels to be closed down by stealth.  It must be kept open.  It is the right thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100018#Q00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1619002200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I will raise a number of issues, the first of which is that I am deeply concerned that the share of funding for mental health services is to fall dramatically to 5.2% in 2021.  Given the pandemic, people are suffering greatly.  I see that all of the time.  I take phone calls from people who are in a desperate state.  These calls come from all age groups.  We need to do more.  Provision must be made for more funding and more services.<\/p>  <p>  I am also very concerned about the lack of psychologists for school-aged teenagers and so on.  I am also concerned about CAMHS, that children are not being seen quickly, and the lack of a system for reports to be made to Deputies when we make representations to CAMHS with the consent of parents.  These parents only come to us when there is a desperate need and when they are concerned.  There needs to be more communication and collaboration with CAMHS.  It needs to communicate with representatives who are trying to do their best for families in their constituencies.  I appeal for that to happen.  Children need to be seen quickly.  Were it not for organisations such as Jigsaw and the great organisation, Accessible Counselling Tullamore, in County Offaly in my own constituency, things would be far worse.  These organisations cannot, however, fill the gaps that are there.  Those gaps need to be filled by Government, although the organisations will play their part.  Government definitely needs to look at the funding, which is falling far short of the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare, which recommend that 10% of health moneys be allocated to mental health.  I ask for that to be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100018#Q00400","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1619002200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>A new research report on suicide has said that the mental health of young people has been disproportionately affected during the Covid pandemic.<\/p> <p>Factors such as loneliness, jobs and income losses, bereavement and the impact of Covid affected people's mental health.  There has been a complete lack of resourcing of mental health services, which will affect generations for years to come.<\/p> <p> It is difficult to give figures on mental health change during Covid but demand on the services of the likes of Aware has increased by 100%.  There is evidence, however, that the mental health of one person in five has been affected during Covid.  Pieta House confirmed to me earlier that 7,000 people received more than 52 hours of one-to-one suicide intervention and bereavement consultation.  It confirmed that it received more than 70,000 crisis calls and texts and some 50% of its clients were under the age of 25.<\/p> <p> I would particularly like to pay tribute to our volunteers who work in Limerick Suicide Watch.  They have been involved in interventions in incidents, which have increased by 30% in two years.  The group's main focus is to keep eyes on the river and identify people who are in need.  As part of the group's suicide awareness and community outreach programmes, volunteers visit schools to talk to the younger people and to let them know it is okay for them to come out and talk and that there is somebody there to talk to.<\/p> <p> Like it or not, working from home is a reality and a UK survey detailed that more than 80% of people are working from home.  The statistics show that people who are working from home suffer a negative impact.  Working from home can be hugely beneficial for some people but it is not for everyone.  If one looks at people who have families it can work but not everyone has a family and there are people who are single.  From a mental health point of view, we are increasingly seeing that women are suffering from mental health the most due to working from home.  We have to get this right.  If people want to work from home let them do so but it does not fit everyone and we need to work with that.  I ask the Minister of State to make sure that everyone has the equal right that if they want to work from home they can do so but that if they do not want to they can go to their workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100018#Q00500","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619002800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I always preface my remarks by saying the Minister of State inherited the situation.  In that context, I welcome this opportunity, although like another speaker said, I do not know whether the word &quot;welcome&quot; is appropriate in relation to what I am about to say.  I will start with the statement of the chairperson of the Mental Health Commission, John Saunders, who said: &quot;The current Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted in stark terms the need for a modern, well-staffed, holistic community-based mental health service.&quot;  That was on the publication of the 2019 annual report of the commission, which was published midway through 2020, and we are waiting on the updated annual report.  I will refer to some of that report.<\/p><p>I am someone who has a privileged background in my working career.  I foolishly thought that things were improving in the 1980s with the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.  That was followed by A Vision for Change, which was followed by Sharing the Vision.  The independent panel, which the Minister of State has worked hard to set up, will be the measuring stick of how serious this Government is about mental health.<\/p><p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for using its Private Members' time for this issue and I welcome this opportunity, although I despair of the words used.  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I cannot say how many times I have spoken on mental health since 2016.  First, we were trying to ascertain where A Vision for Change was at and then we were told there was an update review of the literature.  When it was done, it was done quickly and effectively by the professionals who did it but it took forever to make that decision.  Then A Vision for Change came along.  All the time, the implementation body was gone, although the Government is in the process of re-establishing it.  We should not need to talk about mental health in this Chamber.  There should be a policy and legislation and they should be implemented.  That is why we had an independent panel monitoring body to take it out of our hands and come back with reports to us.  We should be discussing the reports of that independent monitoring body, not discussing the Minister of State's speech in which she is obliged to say what the Government is spending, which is not detailed in context.  We should be looking at the reports of the independent monitoring body.  That is the step I would like to see taken in the future.<\/p><p>It is truly upsetting to read this report.  I will take a pen picture of what the Mental Health Commission found when it looked at the 65 approved centres.  There are also lots of centres that are not approved so somebody might deal with that and outline what the Government's plans are in that regard.  While the commission's staff can go into those facilities, they cannot make them change or comply with the recommendations.  That is a serious gap.  We can look at the number of deaths of people using mental health services alone.  Unfortunately, we are all familiar with the revolving door in emergency departments and the distress it is causing.  I am from Galway and, unfortunately, we have a suicide patrol watch, which I pay tribute to.  That is where we are in Galway with helicopters in the sky and we all tremble and say a prayer if we believe and if we do not believe we say something else.  In that context, in 2019, some 563 people died.  That was the number of deaths of people who were using the mental health services.  Some 166 deaths related to approved centres and 397 deaths related to community mental health services.  Of those, 168 were suspected suicides of people who were attending the mental health services.<\/p><p>I mention the context of the report that has been mentioned by a number of Deputies on child mental health cases due to excessive medication doses and I will come to that in a minute.  I am looking at the report of Dr. Susan Finnerty, inspector of mental health services at the Mental Health Commission, and it is worth looking at.  It is not an onerous chapter in the sense of the number of pages in it but it captures is what I would love to hear from a Government and a Minister when they come in to talk to us.  The report poses the question: &quot;What did we find?&quot;.  It goes on to answer: &quot;We found a number of issues of concern&quot; when the 65 approved centres were inspected.  It states that they found &quot;poor quality in monitoring the physical health of residents&quot; and mentions &quot;the impact of staffing shortages&quot;.  That absence of staff has been mentioned by many.  The report mentions &quot;the failure to provide all residents with a meaningful individual care plan.&quot;  Something as basic as an individual care plan was missing, which Mr. Saunders has pointed out should be the blueprint of care.  The figure for something as basic as that was a 52% non-compliance rate but I am subject to correction.  I might have that figure wrong but it was an extremely high non-compliance rate.<\/p><p>What is also worrying is the level of compliance generally and again the Mental Health Commission is fair.  It does not zone in on one particular criterion but it takes an overall approach.  Some of the percentage compliance rates in 2009 were 56%, 57% and 59%.  In Galway, quite shockingly, there was 70% compliance.  I would expect 95%, 96% or 97% compliance.  The Galway centre is a brand new one, relatively speaking.  Dr. Finnerty and Mr. Saunders stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe patient&rsquo;s individual care plan should be ... the blueprint for their care pathway.  It should be viewed as the patient's care plan, not the clinician's. <\/blockquote>  <p>Then they go onto physical care for persons with severe mental illness, stating: &quot;It remains a fact that in the 21st century people with a mental illness will die between 15-20 years earlier than their peers in the general community, in many cases due to preventable physical illnesses.&quot;<\/p><p>They further state that the system has:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...lost sight of the &lsquo;whole&rsquo; patient and the need to consider both mental and physical factors in the genesis and continuation of mental illness ... While not unique to mental illness, there is a now well documented association between the use of antipsychotics... and the development of metabolic syndrome.  It is estimated that over a third of patients with schizophrenia will develop metabolic syndrome with detrimental effect on their health and life span. <\/blockquote> <p>It goes on and on.  <br\/><br\/>In my remaining two minutes I will deal with one specific issue relating to the review.  Urgent clarification is needed on the review of the excessive medication doses for children.  The question is whether that applies in the west of Ireland, in Galway.  What are the implications throughout the country?  <br\/><br\/>The Mental Health Commission refers to parity of esteem for mental health.  We have not even gone near to having parity of esteem.  When the Minister of State comes into the House in the future, I would like her to address that.  I know she inherited the situation, but the blueprint is there from all the documents.  There was nothing wrong with A Vision for Change.  The time span was from 2006 to 2016; the date was out of date but nothing else was.  It was visionary.  As I have said before, it set out all the problems and inadequacies on the ground, and what we needed.  Successive governments delayed on that.  Not alone did they delay, but they abolished the independent monitoring panel.  The Minister of State has inherited that.  She has an opportunity to say this is out of her hands and that she will be guided by the independent monitoring body regarding the progress or lack of progress.<br\/><br\/>Instead of that, successive governments have delayed, and we got the ridiculous update of literature which could have been done in parallel with the implementation of it.  All the time on the ground the services have been creaking at the seams.  I say that reluctantly.  I am a positive person.  I come from a wonderful city.  I also come from a city where there is a revolving door in respect of mental health.  The report identified that services are operating over capacity.  There is overcrowding, lack of privacy and so many other defects.  Why is this?  It is simply that we have failed to treat it with a parity of esteem.  We do not have appropriate staff on the ground.  We have made too much use of medication as a way of dealing with issues, as appears to be confirmed in the report in today's <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I do not wish to stand up here again and speak on mental health to outline my opinion or anecdotes on the ground.  I want to see the implementation of what is now the policy document, Sharing the Vision.  I want to see updated reports on how far we are progressing with that and what we need to be doing.  That is where my energy and the energy of other Deputies should be directed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100019#R00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619003400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers of State for allowing me the opportunity to speak on the debate.

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought forward new challenges in that people are adversely affected by their loss of business, loss of jobs and new challenges within their own families.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health is not just about health services.  It is also about the other support services such as housing and the justice system within the community.  I have occasionally come across mental health problems where there is not that joined-up follow through from the health services to the housing services and the justice system.  At some stage we need to start looking at that where somebody is discharged from a mental health facility but then there is not that same connection with family or in their care thereafter.  It is an area where we face a new challenge.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the big issues we have with mental health services now relates to getting the appropriate staffing levels.  It is a really difficult job and some people might not want to get into the area.  The important thing is that the people who are in it and the people who have an interest in getting into it are given every possible support to ensure they get adequate training and retraining as changes come about.  It is important to keep upgrading the level of training and education in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of colleagues have spoken about the long-stay facilities for mental health.  Intensive work needs to be done in this area.  For instance, I have come across a facility with six residents per room.  That is no longer a feasible option bearing in mind the challenges of Covid.  We now need to have that review and ensure that adequate funding is put in place in a timely manner to upgrade those facilities.  If the facilities are good, we can also ensure we can hold onto the staff who provide the care.<\/p>  <p>  I again thank the Minister of State and all of the people involved in the mental health services for the work they are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100020#S00300","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1619003400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their interesting, valuable and informative comments on this Private Members' motion on mental health.  I support the opening remarks of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about the opportunity we have today to discuss mental health.<\/p>  <p>  People&rsquo;s physical and mental well-being has been a priority for the Government at all times during the pandemic.  This is reflected in the policies introduced to safeguard the well-being of the whole population, including targeted initiatives for priority groups.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government and mental health services have been particularly active in response to the pressures placed on people&rsquo;s mental health due to Covid-19.  In doing this, we recognise the importance of dealing with any non-specialist mental health issues, such as mild anxiety, before they become bigger issues.  With this in mind, the cross-Government well-being campaign, Keep Well, promotes resilience and minding our physical and mental health.  Some &euro;7 million has been invested in this campaign, to support initiatives with a range of partners, including \"Keeping in Contact\", with the Community Call programme aimed at people who might be experiencing isolation and offering befriending services.<\/p>  <p>  The interdependencies between physical and mental health are well known.  The need for a whole-person approach to achieving good standards of physical and mental health and well-being has been recognised in formulating our mental health policy, as has the need to support the wider psychological aspects of physical health challenges.<\/p> <p>The HSE service plan reflects a balance of prioritised new developments across the health sector.  These include initiatives to improve national mental health through well-being programmes.  In addition, the implementation of Sharing the Vision will have increased impact across all age groups, focusing on mental health promotion, early intervention, acute care, forensic inpatient care and postvention supports in the community.  It is recognised that vulnerable groups, such as mental health service users, have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19.  The cross-government group, chaired by Department of the Taoiseach, was established to co-ordinate support for these vulnerable groups.<\/p> <p> Budget 2021 provided &euro;175,000 for initiatives for victims of domestic violence and for the LGBTI community, and &euro;5.5 million has been provided to enhance health services for people who are homeless and in addiction.  Additionally, more than 1,400 additional beds were provided as part of the winter plan and in response to Covid.<\/p> <p> It is acknowledged there are aspects of mental health services that require improvement.  I would like to recap some of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler and the Government&rsquo;s commitments.  Enormous work has been undertaken to improve our mental health services.  Sharing the Vision has been published and the national implementation monitoring committee is driving its implementation.  The suicide reduction strategy, Connecting for Life, has been extended by four years to 2024 to enable its continued implementation.  The National Forensic Mental Health Service will relocate to a purpose-built new facility in Portrane and will open this year.  The Mental Health Act 2001 is undergoing a major overhaul.  The significant allocation of in excess of &euro;1.1 billion for mental health in budget 2021 not only will enable us to continue to run our mental health services but also will allow us to enhance and develop new services and supports.<\/p> <p> I thank Members for the opportunity to discuss the very important issue of mental health and for their input, which will assist us in improving services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100020#S00400","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619004000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We know that mental health was in crisis pre-Covid.  We know also the crisis has escalated throughout Covid, but what does this mean?  It means people are suffering and experiencing great trauma and loss, huge change and anxiety, financial strain and pressure, and home insecurity.  The Government's response to mental health has fallen short for many years.  I note the Mental Health Commission told the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that Ireland's mental health system is not fit for purpose, it is out of date and investment in it and the community is needed.  On behalf of my constituents in County Clare, I am asking if the Government will take stock now.  Will it respond to the needs of its people?  They hope so.<\/p>  <p>  There is still no State-wide provision of 24-7 crisis mental health care at community level.  This is a significant failure and the issue on which I want to focus today.  I want to stand up for the many in County Clare who have made great attempts at reaching out for help, especially the constituents who live in rural and isolated areas.  Unfortunately, until we have 24-7 crisis mental health care in the community, we run the risk of our people experiencing further trauma and negativity, with some who have reached out to me describing it as a complete rejection.  In their experience, to ask for help when in distress is an incredibly difficult step to take.  This needs to be reflected on by those in power.  Unless you have the personal experience, there is no appreciation of that overwhelming feeling when you knock on a door and it goes unanswered.  That is a feeling that you just do not exist.<\/p>  <p>  This week I held a discussion via Zoom with community and service representatives within County Clare, who spoke about the high levels of demand on the ground and the rise in the number of people reaching out for support for the first time.  I commend them on the great work they have been doing.  The reality is people are losing loved ones, jobs, relationships, cars and homes and they are gripped with fear.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the establishment of a 24-7 care public crisis de-escalation multi-agency triage team ambulance service.

My only disappointment is that while they said they will not oppose it, they are not supporting it.<\/p>  <p>  A great deal has been already said so I do not propose to get into the nitty-gritty of the issues.  It was mentioned earlier that the Government inherited this crisis and I accept that is extremely difficult.  This Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy Ward, whom I commend on bringing it forward, sets out a number of measures such as the establishment of a talk therapy fund, emergency care within the private healthcare system to take the pressure off the public system, universal counselling in primary care services, address of the capacity issues in CAMHS and primary care, the training and education for counselling psychologists, 24-7 mental health services, and the multi-agency triage team ambulance service.  These asks are reflective of the asks of Mental Health Reform, which has also called for an increase in the staffing levels of front-line and primary care specialist care, improved capacity and access to community care and special mental health services, and the Government to resource voluntary service providers that are struggling owing to reduced funding and so on.<\/p>  <p>  As mentioned by many speakers today, we have debated mental health services many times.  We are in bad place at the moment and there is the possibility of a major mental health tsunami coming down the road.  We are a reactive rather than proactive society.  We need to pool our resources and put in place preventative and proactive measures such that we will not be here talking about this again in six months' time.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to comment on the Mental Health Commission report.  While reading it, I had cause to shake my head a number of times.  The level of non-compliance is disappointing.  I recognise the work of those on the front line, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Ambulance Service, the fire service and front-line staff and management within the mental health service, all of whom are overstretched and doing their best.  Let this not be a talking shop.  I appeal to everyone to get this done.  It will cost in the region of &euro;60 million, which is not a lot of money, but it will be a start in terms of saving people's lives.

Unfortunately, my own city of Limerick has the highest number of suicides.  Limerick is almost always ranked the highest in the State in terms of suicides, and that has not changed in recent years.  The Covid crisis has exacerbated the situation.  I met recently with representatives from a number of services and with whom I speak almost daily.  They might be dealing with different aspects of the mental health crisis, but they all say that the numbers presenting are increasing, waiting lists are getting longer and, while they are doing their best, they are overwhelmed.  We need urgent intervention.  It is a crisis.  In Limerick, suicide can be very public.  The trauma of the helicopter flying over the city while a search for a loved one is under way is not just traumatic for the family but for the community as a whole.  It is very upsetting.  As I mentioned, local services are stretched and under pressure, and Covid has exacerbated the situation.<\/p>  <p>  In the mid-west, the waiting list for psychological services for adults was 505.  There are also 243 children between the ages of five and seven who have been waiting for services for more than a year.  That is scandalous and it needs to be addressed.  We need a particular intervention in that regard.  If anything comes out of today's debate, I hope it will be the establishment of a de-escalation team in Limerick to deal with the emergency.  We are failing people.  I commend the local services in Limerick, including Limerick Suicide Watch and Limerick Treaty Suicide Prevention, who patrol the bridges and city at night-time.<\/p> <p>I have been out with the people involved and I told them that they are the last defence where the services have failed and, unfortunately, people may take their own lives.  I do not want to be here again next year or the year after talking about the same issue.  My own city, as I said, is particularly affected, and it the highest number of suicides.

The Minister of State said she will not oppose the motion.  That is all fine and well but what is needed is action.  In response to her maiden speech as Minister of State, I said that I would work with her in opposition in a real, tangible and solution-focused way.  I was talking about motions like this when I said that.  It is time for her to stand up and be counted and to put the actions in place that are laid out in the motion.  I am putting her on notice that I will be holding her to account in regard to this motion for the duration of her term as Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome some of the initiatives she mentioned in her contribution that may be coming on board.  However, we need to see fast improvements for the 10,000 people waiting on the public psychology lists and we need to see additional capacity put into CAMHS.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State to put in place a 24-7 emergency mental healthcare service in order that people can get the care they need, where and when they need it.  As Deputy Quinlivan said, a crisis de-escalation team must be put in place to meet the need that exists in the State.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid crisis, many people are experiencing mental health issues for the first time.  It is a really frightening place to be.  The Minister of State is not opposing this motion but I ask, in particular, that she support the proposal to put in place immediate access to talk therapy for patients from GP referrals, without the medical card barrier.  Deputy Cairns mentioned community service providers.  They can be resourced to provide this service.  It is a win-win situation.  Community services will get the resources they need and people who need mental health services will get the care they need.  I will call the Minister of State out every chance I get if this provision is not implemented.  I really hope I will not have to do so.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on her to place additional capacity in our private mental health hospitals.  I ask that she prioritise people with eating disorders.  She referred to funding of &euro;3.9 million coming down the road.  People need help here and now.  Some of them are dying right in front of us.  The motion outlines a roadmap for mental health supports in the here and now.  I will watch intently for progress on its proposals.

I am very conscious that as the light at the end of the tunnel gets a little bit brighter for people, we are beginning to consider what life, and Ireland, will look like once the pandemic passes and the public emergency is over.  It is very encouraging that, despite everything people have been through in the past year, they still have that sense of hope and that sense of appetite for a better and fairer Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Long before the Covid emergency, people faced very many profound crises because of bad politics and bad government.  Many of those crises deepened during the pandemic but the one that really stands out is the housing emergency, alongside the mental health emergency, which colleagues discussed this morning.  When the Taoiseach came to office, he said that his Government would fix housing.  He came to office on the back of an election campaign that was very heavily focused on the housing crisis.  However, since coming to office, what we have seen is more of the same, persisting with the same kinds of developer-led policies that created the mess we have in the first place.  Any claim of progress that might be made by the Government or the Taoiseach is now cruelly exposed by the shocking numbers of tents we see around the city centre of Dublin and the heart-wrenching image that we have seen of a four-year old child sitting on a crate here in the capital city eating her dinner on the side of the street.  It is not the first time we have seen a child eating his or her dinner in similar circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  This is the sharpest edge of the bad policy and bad government that have seen house prices go up and up.  Indeed, the CSO tells us that house prices in Dublin have increased by a staggering 96% in the past nine years.  These are not mansions, by the way; these are modest family homes.  Meanwhile, extortionate rents continue to soar.  In fact, rents are so high that many first-time buyers struggle to save a deposit.  How on earth could any person save for a deposit when rent is &euro;2,000 or more a month?  It is a nightmarish trap in which people find themselves caught.  As a result, an entire generation is locked out of owning their own home.  This generation have had to put their lives on hold and curtail their aspirations because Government continues to choose policies that make the situation worse.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of things is that it does not have to be this way.  We need to build affordable housing that people can actually afford.  That means the State leading from the front.  It means direct investment and it means dropping the developer-led approach that is still in evidence, for example, in the Government's shared equity scheme.  We need to intervene on behalf of renters.  We have to ensure that evictions remain banned for the foreseeable future.  Above all, we need to ensure that rents are cut and increases in rents are banned.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to guarantee, and to offer to work with the rest of us to ensure, that we see a cut in rents and any increase in rents banned.  Rents need to be frozen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100022#U00600","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1619004600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I have to disagree with the Deputy's presentation of the issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been in a coalition Government with the Fine Gael Party and the Green Party for ten months, having been out of government for ten years.  We have made housing a major priority of Government, with our colleagues.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has applied great energy to a range of measures designed to deal with the housing issue and homelessness.  The photograph the Deputy referred to is a very upsetting one, but progress has been made on homelessness in the past ten months.  Family homelessness has declined by approximately 42% and homelessness overall by 19%, but more needs to be done.  Progress has been made in regard to homelessness but we are determined to do more and to expand the Housing First programme, which has been effective in reducing homelessness, particularly for single adults.  That is something on which the Minister is very focused.<\/p>  <p>  We want to create opportunities for people to own their own homes.  We also want to create opportunities for people to get faster access to social housing, with the State taking a key role in building, and facilitating the building of, social houses.  A total of &euro;3.3 billion was allocated in the budget, which is an unprecedented sum, to make sure we can start to build the largest social housing programme in the history of the State.<\/p> <p>Over the lifetime of the Government it will result in 50,000 new social houses being built.  We were hit in the first three months of the year, which the Deputy has not acknowledged.  We had to shut down construction significantly because of Covid-19 and the third wave.  We allowed some social housing to stay open to complete projects.  We are very determined in respect of the social housing agenda to build 12,750 new social houses this year.  That was the target prior to the shutting down of construction for the first few months of the year.  Some 9,500 of those were new-build homes.  We are committed and we will do everything we can to accelerate that.  We are going to look at a void programme again this year, like we did last year.  As soon as we came into office we went straight at it and got close to 3,500 houses back into use through allocation of funding to local authorities for the voids.<\/p> <p> The new equity scheme that Deputy McDonald talks about will help 2,000 people to be in a position to buy their own homes this year, if we can get that through with the legislation.  A new affordable purchase scheme with the State directly building affordable homes is another key initiative to help people to buy their own homes.  There is a retained and expanded help-to-buy scheme.  The Deputy talks about giving people the opportunity to own their own homes and to aspire to that.  Yet, she opposed the help-to-buy scheme and continues to oppose the shared equity scheme while making claims about it that are completely exaggerated in terms of its impact.  The launch of the Land Development Agency is an important part of policy, as is the new cost-rental scheme that the Minister has introduced, which will create wider options for people this year in respect of the rental area.  We want to expand that significantly.<\/p> <p> There is a comprehensive programme here.  It is unprecedented in scale.  No shortage of resources has been allocated across all strands of the housing area.  I appeal to the Deputy that on the various local authorities where her party members are represented to stop opposing housing projects.  Let us have a consensus across all the parties in the House that we facilitate projects now and get them going.  That is important in terms of giving people opportunities.  There is no point in standing up in the House and saying we want people to have an opportunity to own homes and get access to social housing if projects are delayed and delayed and opposed and opposed and nothing gets built where projects are shovel-ready.

On 23 February, the Taoiseach stated to the nation that by the end of June up to 82% of adults would have at least their first vaccination.  Fewer than two months later, the head of vaccine roll-out at the HSE, Damien McCallion, who is a very capable individual, said yesterday that he was not in a position to confirm whether the June target will be achieved.  He was being diplomatic as usual as is his style, to be fair to him.<\/p><p>Supply is clearly an issue.  I acknowledge that and I have always acknowledged that.  There have been 12 changes this week alone to the dates of delivery times and volumes.  This haphazard approach is worrying.

I share the Taoiseach's frustration.<\/p><p>I want ask the Taoiseach directly to give him an opportunity to say publicly whether we will still meet the 82% target or, as is being reported in some media, such as in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>today, that reaching the target of 82% is now being pushed to July.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that we are still going to reach that target?  Will we still get 250,000 vaccines into people per week by the end of this month?  That is what was committed to.<\/p><p>There is a second component.  When will the national immunisation advisory committee meet in respect of Johnson and Johnson?  We have the European Medicines Agency report.  Speed is of the essence here and every day counts.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House when NIAC will meet in respect of this and on the proposal relating to vaccine intervals and spreading those out?<\/p><p>Third, I am concerned about the vaccination centres and the volume of vaccinators.  This whole issue has been a mess from the beginning.  Roles are being constantly advertised.  Five times advertisements have gone out looking for more.  If we have enough vaccinators, why are we always advertising for more?  We now want radiographers, dental hygienists, medical students etc.  Some 1,100 have been vaccinated but it has been said that we need between 2,500 and 5,000.<\/p><p>Finally, the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on Monday reported yet another new oversight group had been set up in the Department of the Taoiseach.  This group is being called the vaccine roll-out group and is to be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The report said the group was being set up &quot;to avoid some of the serious political and logistical differences that have arose in rolling out the programme.&quot;  Why is this being set up?  Why do we need a new layer of bureaucracy?  I have asked previously for a vaccine Minister and that was dismissed.  The majority of people would agree with me at this stage.  Is this new group really a mudguard set up by the Taoiseach around the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, because of the concern the Taoiseach and his Government have with regard to the governance of the vaccine to date by the Minister for Health?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100023#V00400","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1619005200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>First, we should acknowledge that the vaccine programme has been very effective.  The only qualification we ever put in terms of the roll out of the vaccination programme was one of supply.  It is well-known that we have had difficulties, in particular with AstraZeneca, in terms of supply and consistency in matching commitments to deliver with the delivery schedule and the actual supply of the vaccines.  Overall, 1.238 million vaccines have been administered.  It has had a significant impact on the incidence of the disease in nursing homes and, critically, a significant impact on mortality and severe illness.  Likewise, it has had a significant impact with front-line healthcare workers and the over 70s.  It has been effective in those over 70 years of age.  The portal has now been established and the speed at which people have registered and received dates has been well commented upon in society.<\/p> <p>Many families are delighted to see their vulnerable members getting dates for vaccines and getting vaccinated.  The key impact on mortality and severe illness has to be acknowledged and it has been very effective so far.  The target is still the target.  I am not confirming any changes to this whatsoever but here are challenges as to supply.  The Deputy has instanced some even this week with AstraZeneca.  We saw last week because of decisions taken at European level and NIAC's advice in respect of the AstraZeneca vaccine and its application, which has been narrowed to 60 to 70-year-old, those clinics were cancelled.  There is also the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson decision at European level.  <\/p> <p> Among the key issues which fall to be determined are the interval between doses, which is being examined by NIAC in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer.  There is also the issue of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and the response to the decision by the EMA and its assessment in respect of the benefits of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson drug outweighing any risks.  NIAC will consider and assess the research on that issue.  There is then the issue of AstraZeneca itself and its capacity to deliver on its commitments.  It has delayed a large commitment from late April to 3 May and it is saying that if it gets certain authorisations around manufacturing in certain locations that that could enhance its capacity to deliver.  Its situation has been challenging from the get-go here.  <\/p> <p> Depending on the outcomes on much of that, the situation can improve significantly.  If the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine was made available, another 600,000 or so additional vaccines would be available in the second quarter.  The issue then would be the administration of vaccines in this quarter.  I will return with more information later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100023#V00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619005800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Taoiseach is somewhat nervous about answering these questions but I asked four questions and he essentially ran down the clock and answered one.

I raise one very important issue for many people in Ireland which is public worship.  The statutory instrument introduced by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, in a very clandestine way and without any notice of consultation, has greatly upset the leaders of all the churches, especially following on from the fact that the Taoiseach had only met them two days before that.<\/p>  <p>  Archbishop Eamon Martin has issued a statement saying that it is highly disappointing that despite the reassurance of the Taoiseach to church leaders that he understands the importance of faith and worship, the Government then introduced a statutory instrument. They consider that a breach of trust.  <\/p>  <p>  Many people in my constituency, and I am sure in every other Member's constituency, went to mass as part of the daily routine, especially retired people.  They probably went to 10 o&rsquo;clock mass in the morning to a cathedral or church where there may have been 20 to 30 people there.  It was part of their socialisation and they probably then went for a cup of coffee afterwards on some days.  It was a place to meet and have a chat.  They took on board the fact that regulations and restrictions were introduced and complied fully with all of them in the interests of saving this country from the pandemic.  When the churches reopened, they were controlled and conducted in a way that was exemplary.  A church is a hell of a lot safer place to go to mass where there is social distancing than to go to a supermarket or all of these other areas.  The churches took on board that they were closed again after Christmas.  People are longing to get back to public worship, to receive the sacraments, and to do it in a way that complies with restrictions and with social distancing.  <\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Taoiseach for two things.  First, will he look at that statutory instrument, which is really and truly a sword thrown into people who just have religion?  It is a wrong way for this country to go.  He needs to look at it and repeal it, which is very easy to do.<\/p>  <p> Second, I ask the Taoiseach to let me know how soon will we see public worship coming back into people&rsquo;s lives?  It is important for their mental health and for their ongoing engagement with their religion, no matter what religion they subscribe to.  I think about the people who used to go to 10 a.m. mass every day who cannot do that and are complying totally with what the Government has asked them to do, and rightly so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100024#W01700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1619005800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  I regard religious worship as a very fundamental right in any democratic society.  We should acknowledge that the application of very stringent public health emergency legislation imposes many restrictions on personal and civil liberties.  We rarely in ordinary times would apply such restrictions more generally on people.  A global pandemic is such a context.  It is the common good which must prevail in such a pandemic.  I have had a number of meetings.  I met in October with representatives of the Catholic Church and met with the wider faith groups on 17 November and again with the Catholic archbishops on 19 February.  I met with church leaders, particularly those from of Northern Ireland in the context of Northen Ireland and not of Covid-19 restrictions, on 15 April.  That meeting was about recent developments in the North and about emerging from Covid-19 in an inclusive way in terms of the left behind and marginalised communities and to ensure that, economically, we would be more inclusive.  There were brief references to Covid-19 at the end of that meeting.<\/p> <p>It was unanimous that religious ceremonies would not take place under level 5 restrictions.  There was no argument about that.  In fact, the request made in October by church leaders was that they were annoyed that religious services and ceremonies were excluded at level 3 and they wanted the Government to consider facilitating Mass and religious services generally under level 3, which we facilitated for Christmas.  We facilitated that for Christmas.  At the meeting in February, two requests were made, namely, to consider allowing religious worship and Mass for the Easter ceremonies and also to look at increasing the number allowed at funerals, which we are doing next Monday.  We have decided to increase that to 25, which is still very difficult for families and people who have suffered bereavement.  I think that is one of the worst aspects of Covid-19.  <\/p> <p> However, I think it needs to be said loud and clear that the only motivation of the Government is to protect life and to protect people from severe illness.  There is no other motivation.  The Government is not anti-religious.  It is not out to suppress religious worship.  Any suggestion to the contrary is deeply offensive, wrong and unfair.  We are motivated by public health and the guidance and advice we receive from NPHET and public health.  The regulation to which the Deputy is referring is a general regulation that covers all indoor gatherings.  Internationally, indoor gatherings have proven to be responsible for a lot of spread of Covid.  We will be looking at this situation next week.

Nobody is accusing him or the Government of being anti-religious.

Religious ceremonies play a vital role in society and so many people in this country have religious beliefs, whatever religious belief that may be.  I understand there is a predicament here but it may come back to the handling or communication of how the statutory instrument was introduced and how it has affected people's attitude.  I am concerned that people across the country are very exercised about the fact that they are playing their part for this country in every way they can and have proven to be a success in that regard, as evidenced by the way the numbers are going at the moment.

Next week, we will be making an announcement in terms of what we can do.  That will depend on the public health advice that we will receive but also decision-making in terms of what we believe to be the correct thing to do.  We have said we will look at religious services in our announcement next week for the month of May.  We will be doing that.  We understand fully that there are many people across the country for whom attending religious service is key.  It is key to their spirituality, well-being and faith.  We understand that fully and we understand that people dearly want to return to that and to have those opportunities.  As I stated, the purpose of the restrictions is to enable that to happen.

McCauley's pharmacy put that worker and many of her work colleagues on the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, without their knowledge.  She and her colleagues received notice from Revenue early this year, stating she had a tax obligation from March to September 2020.  That means she has effectively taken a pay cut of more than &euro;2,000.  Workers were told they owe anything from &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,500 tax liability, which is essentially an effective pay cut of up to three to five weeks' pay.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary wage subsidy scheme was introduced to assist companies to keep their workers on the payroll throughout the pandemic and to keep companies open.  The logic of the scheme was positive in terms of the initiative by the Government.  The criteria for the TWSS were that it was for companies experiencing significant negative economic disruption and that were able to demonstrate to Revenue a minimum of a 25% decline in turnover, in which case the State would pay up to 70% to 85% of the workers' net wage, to a maximum of &euro;410.  Employer's PRSI was reduced from 11.5% to 0.5% and Revenue dropped tax liability on the workers' gross pay.<\/p>  <p>  Many workers were receiving their net pay without realising that their employer was availing of the TWSS.  I have been contacted by other workers employed by McCauley's pharmacy, as well as many other workers.  One of those who contacted me works for a US multinational company with three plants in Ireland, while another works for a different US multinational manufacturing company which he states gained &euro;15,000 by putting him on the scheme while he faces a &euro;2,500 tax bill.  He states that the unit in which he works posted profits of more than &euro;1.5 million in 2020.  The TWSS section of the Revenue website has an A to Z list of hundreds of companies that have applied for the scheme, which translates into thousands of workers, effectively.  These workers are outraged.  They are front-line workers who have been deemed essential workers and they are now being taxed on their net pay.  This is wrong.  Revenue has established on its website a facility for companies such as McCauley's pharmacy to pay their workers the tax liability yet this is not happening.  I do not think the Government introduced the scheme in order for workers to receive an effective pay cut and employers to benefit from the scheme at their expense.<\/p>  <p>  When I raised this issue with the Taoiseach previously, he advised me to send details of the worker's specific case to him even though I emphasised it was affecting the majority of workers in McCauley's pharmacy.  I sent him those details.  On 15 March, I received an email from the Department of the Taoiseach, stating that the case was being forwarded to the Department of Social Protection.  It was then forwarded to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  The silence since then has been deafening.  I am putting it to the Taoiseach that he should not allow these workers to take an effective pay cut.  He should do the decent thing, instruct Revenue to change tack and instruct employers to pay the tax liability or, otherwise, scrap the tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100025#X00400","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1619006400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>First of all, the purpose and objective of the scheme was to preserve employment and the viability of companies.  Without the scheme, a lot of jobs would have been lost and, more importantly, the capacity of companies to re-emerge after Covid, or as we emerge out of Covid, would have been impaired very considerably.  Jobs would have been lost if these schemes were not put in place in the first instance.  Significant sums of money have been provided by the State and the Government to provide for the EWSS, the TWSS and CRSS schemes as well as a range of other supports to ensure the viability of companies and firms.  That is the number one point which benefits all employees and thousands of workers as well as the companies as entities themselves.  This is not something that was introduced to disadvantage workers.  I would argue that, in the round, it has not disadvantaged workers because in many cases it will secure their jobs into the future as we emerge from Covid.  Our big concern at the outset was that many companies might not survive Covid.  In the national economic recovery plan that we will be launching towards the middle of the year, part of the agenda there will be to protect and help companies and strengthen them.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the tax treatment, we do not interfere with Revenue but we are trying to facilitate workers and ensure that no one is hit with anything large overnight or in a cliff-edge situation.  In terms of the issue raised by the Deputy, the tax situation applies in terms of one's income and the various thresholds that apply.<\/p> <p>The Deputy said people \"put\" workers on the scheme.  The whole thing was intended to protect the workers and their employment, as opposed to people being made redundant and perhaps falling back on the pandemic unemployment payment which I do not think was ideal.  It has been challenging because the pandemic has now gone on for well over a year.  Our overarching priority was to preserve employment, in the first instance, and then to see how we could help people in terms of the fall-out of Covid on their individual income levels and future employment needs.  If certain companies and entities do not make it through, we must consider what we can do to create further employment opportunities.

I am asking the Taoiseach to instruct Revenue to change tact and tell these companies to pay their workers' tax liability through the facility on the website of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is simply it.  They have been given an option now.  We know that other companies have paid those tax liabilities, including McCabe's pharmacy, KN Network Services and other companies.  This has to be a case where a company is responsible for those liabilities.  They have gained a huge amount and managed to keep their companies afloat.

Twenty-four houses in Cootehill would have made a huge difference to those seeking housing in the area, many of whom have been on the housing list for years and living in very poor conditions.  The residents of a private housing estate objected to the proposal to locate the entrance of the new estate in their estate.  That is why five of the six councillors voted against the development.  What alternatives are there to construct social housing in Cootehill, but also in Cavan in general?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100030#CC00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1619009100,"counter":140,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, my view is that we have to provide for social and affordable housing and move away from creating barriers to getting housing built in this country given the crisis that many people who cannot access housing currently experience.

First, the recent interim chair, who is stepping down, indicated that funding of &euro;2.5 billion is not enough and that the agency&rsquo;s mission may be curtailed.

Second, we need to streamline the public procurement process.  In this regard, the largest city council, Dublin City Council, is having real difficulty in that it takes four to six years to get a project off the ground.

They will replace the book of quantum, which, until now, has been used by the courts and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to determine the level of awards in personal injury cases.  Since these guidelines were adopted and published, the insurance industry has moved quickly to row back on many of the commitments it made to reducing insurance premiums, and that cannot be allowed to happen.  It should not be allowed to move the goalposts.  The insurance industry called for these guidelines, the Oireachtas passed legislation to allow them to take effect and the Judiciary has done its job in reducing the awards in respect of the guidelines.  Now, the insurance companies have to reduce substantially the cost of premiums for motorists, homeowners and business people.<\/p><p>The insurance industry, when it lobbied for these guidelines, told us that insurance costs would fall once they were adopted.  They came before me and other members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and the CEO of Zurich Insurance stated the following in the context of a hypothetical drop of 50% in claims for soft-tissue personal injury awards: &quot;It would be quite reasonable that if that were to happen and insurers had reduced their prices, with all things being equal and somewhere in the region of 10% to 15%, the committee should ask us a lot of questions.&quot;  He went on to state that for liability, we should expect prices to drop even more, a fall of 20%.  The guidelines adopted by the Oireachtas and the Judicial Council go well beyond the 50% that the leaders of the insurance industry talked about before the committee, in some cases reducing the level of awards by more than 50%.<\/p><p>We should not let the industry off the hook and it should be held to account.  We need a way to verify that the reductions in awards facilitated in personal injury cases by the Houses of Oireachtas are passed on, euro for euro, to consumers in order that policyholders see a reduction in their premiums as they take out insurance.  Those savings must be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices - no excuses.  We have heard of Ministers meeting representatives of the insurance industry, imploring them to reduce prices as a result of the new guidelines.  This legislation will ensure that happens and provide transparency in this issue.  We need a way of verifying that every euro in the lower awards has been passed on to consumers.<\/p><p>Section 1 will provide for the interpretation of where the principal Act refers to the Judicial Council Act, which the Bill amends.<\/p><p>Section 2 will amend the Judicial Council Act by adding a new section that provides for a report on the effect of the personal injury guidelines on the cost of insurance.  It will provide the Department of Finance with the ability to make regulations that will require insurance companies to provide information to the Central Bank on how the new personal injury guidelines have impacted on policies for policyholders.  In particular, section 2(4) will provide that the regulations may require insurance companies to provide the Central Bank with information about a number of matters, namely, the amount paid by insurers by way of personal injuries, the amount that would have been paid in personal injury awards if the personal injury had not come into effect, the amount charged by insurance companies by way of premiums for policies covering third-party personal injuries and the amount that insurance companies would have expected to charge by way of premiums if the guidelines had not come into effect.  The information will be required for each of the four years following the personal injury guidelines having come into effect.  Some Deputies may say this is onerous on the insurance industry, but this is the only way we will be able to verify whether the reduction in claims for personal injuries has resulted in a euro-for-euro reduction in the cost of premiums for motorists, businesses and homeowners, or whether the insurance industry has pocketed some of those reductions despite the commitments it gave.<\/p><p>The six largest insurance companies in Ireland are AXA, Aviva, Allianz, RSA, Zurich and FBD, and they are also the six largest insurance companies in Britain.  When the British Government reduced the awards for whiplash injuries, it passed very similar legislation because it wanted to ensure that those same companies that operate here were not pocketing awards and that they were being passed on to consumers.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.  It is a way to ensure that the intention of the personal injuries guidelines passed by this House and adopted by the Judiciary will result in reductions to consumers and not fatten the pockets of the insurance industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1619009700,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619009700,"counter":154,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD00500","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619009700,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1619009700,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD00800","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619009700,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD00900","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619009700,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Hospital Parking Bill 2021: First Stage","time":1619009700,"counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1619009700,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for parking free of charge for persons attending outpatient services in public hospitals; and to provide for related matters. <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank Deputy Berry for co-signing the Bill.  Since 2012, hospital car parks have taken more than &euro;100 million from patients, through either parking charges or clamping fees.  This money has, obviously, come from the pockets of patients, who can least afford it.  What is often forgotten, when people think of illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and mental illness, is that those illnesses take a significant health toll on those individuals and their families.  The Irish Cancer Society estimates that having cancer increases one's costs by between &euro;800 and &euro;1,200 a month because of the additional things one has to pay for.  People also typically see a drop in their income of &euro;1,400 a month if they have one of these significant long-term illnesses.  These costs include car journeys to and from treatment, hotel or bed and breakfast overnight stays they may have to cover or even childminding.  <\/p><p>I am aware that in certain hospitals, there is free car parking for perhaps 20 minutes.  Cancer patients present at the waiting rooms, and leave after 20 minutes to take their car out of the car park and bring it back in order that they can avail of free car parking for a further 20 minutes.  This is an incredible practice that is happening in hospitals throughout the country, and it is not unusual in Ireland.  Hospital car parking charges are a tax on those who are ill.  They take money from those who can least afford it.  We believe that the health service should be funded by the State, funds should be centrally provided for through taxation and we should not hit patients for this charge.<\/p><p>The Irish Cancer Society has carried out a good bit of work on this issue and worked out that people who have cancer typically spend &euro;700 on car parking charges a year, an incredible figure.  We have seen how much money this generates for hospitals.  A total of &euro;12 million was taken last year through car parking charges in hospitals.  One hospital made &euro;30,000 in one week, while another was estimated to have made &euro;60,000 in one day in 2017, an unbelievable sum.  In 2018, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, announced there would be a review of hospital car parking charges.  I understand, however, that the recommendations of that review have never been published.  It was suggested some hospitals should cap their charges at &euro;10 a day, but my understanding is this has not been properly complied with by many hospitals.  Where a cap exists, people do not know about it.  Just before the general election in 2020, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in had within their manifestos a promise to bring in legislation to get rid of these charges, which are targeted at the most vulnerable.<\/p> <p>It is my understanding, however, that none of these parties have made good on those pre-election promises.  We in Aont&uacute; have developed this Bill.  It is very simple.  It provides for an entitlement to free parking for up to three hours in the car park of a public hospital where the driver of a vehicle or a passenger is attending that hospital to receive outpatient treatment.  We urge the other political parties not to just nod their heads and offer platitudes in respect of the Bill, but to help us to get it through the D&aacute;il quickly so that we can alleviate this tax on patients as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The Irish Cancer Society has also campaigned for a cut in hospital car parking charges.  It is incredible that figures around the country are uneven.  Many people do not understand what the charges are and are being significantly stung financially because of these charges.<\/p> <p> Our Bill also makes allowance for hospitals to make specific changes to allow for spaces to be kept available for patients who need them if their car parks completely overflow as a result of this new Bill.  This is a carefully thought-out Bill and a simple one.  I believe that all political parties should agree with it.  I urge political parties across the D&aacute;il to support the Aont&uacute; Bill to make sure that we get rid of these shocking charges, this taxation on patients, once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100031#DD01200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619010300,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100032#EE00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619010300,"counter":163,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100032#EE00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619010300,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1619010300,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100032#EE00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619010300,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100032#EE00600","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619010300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Companies (Protection of Employees\u2019 Rights in Liquidations) Bill 2021: First Stage","time":1619010300,"counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100032#EE00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1619010300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduced a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Companies Act 2014 to provide for preferential creditor status to employees in collective redundancy situations; to provide for recognition of redundancy payments in a winding up; and to provide for related matters. <\/blockquote>  <p>In the interests of full disclosure, this Bill was inspired by the actions of one group of people and by the inaction of another.  Those whose actions have inspired this Bill are the Debenhams workers in Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Tralee and Newbridge.  They have fought a heroic campaign for more than 12 months to win a just redundancy settlement.  They have spoken out, campaigned, picketed and occupied their former workplaces, all with a view to winning the four weeks' redundancy per year of service that had been promised to them by their previous employers.  Although it is clear they have justice on their side, the law has been against them all along, which brings us to the second group of people.<\/p><p>The group whose inaction has not so much inspired the Bill but rather forced me to bring forward this legislation comprises the conservative parties of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  These have led successive Governments down the years that have refused to act on this issue.  They did not change the law after the Vita Cortex dispute.  Following the Clerys dispute, they promised that the Clerys workers would be the last to suffer this situation.  That has not turned out to be the case.  One year after the beginning of the Debenhams dispute, they still have not taken action.  The Arcadia workers are now suffering as a result of that inaction.  If they will not act on the issue, we will.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to change the law in two regards.  First, it seeks to put workers at the head of the queue when it comes to payouts from a liquidation pot.  Second, it seeks to make an unpaid collective redundancy agreement a recognised debt in the eyes of the law, a debt which must be taken into account in the liquidation process.  These two small changes could make a big difference to working people.<\/p><p>There is a jobs massacre on the way.  Just before we came in here today, we heard about 486 jobs being lost in Carphone Warehouse.  I am not sure if this involves a liquidation but it still underlines my point.  My hope is that working people will push back against this jobs massacre, first and foremost by fighting to defend jobs.  Where workers decide instead to fight for decent redundancy terms, however, we want the law of the land to be a help and not a hindrance.  It is precisely with this in mind that this Bill was drafted.  <\/p><p>I understand that this legislation may not be the only legislation to come before this D&aacute;il with the aim of improving workers' rights in a liquidation.  For instance, I understand that Sinn F&eacute;in may be considering tabling a Bill of its own.  Let me be clear: I am not at all precious about this legislation.  If other Bills are put forward which would improve workers' rights, we will support those Bills.  Equally, we expect the authors of any such Bills to support this legislation. <\/p><p>When I put this legislation before the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, the eyes of many workers, and not only those of Debenhams workers and their families, will be on the vote of each and every Deputy.  I sincerely hope that a majority will back this legislation and make it law.  However, should the Government parties choose not to support it, I hope and expect that the issue will not go away and will become an issue in the next general election.  <\/p><p>Following First Stage, it is my intention to bring this legislation to the Debenhams workers and their families, to the Arcadia workers and their families, to workers everywhere and to the trade union movement.  I want to build a campaign in support of the proposals in this Bill and to put enough work into that campaign that it ceases to be my Bill and becomes instead the Bill of the Debenhams workers, the people who inspired its drafting, and the Bill of working people generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100032#EE00900","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1619010300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Is

Young people have been especially hard-hit by this pandemic.  They have been hard-hit in their education and work prospects as well as rents and the prices of homes and into the near future I predict evictions.  Young people are over-represented in insecure and low-paid employment, despite a high level of education, skill and enthusiasm for the future.  The pandemic has delayed a generation of talented youth from entering into and engaging fully with the workforce.  This will have a massive knock-on effect on future earnings and progression.  Nearly 60% of young people aged 15 to 24 are out of work with young women even worse affected.<\/p>  <p>  This is becoming no country for young people.  We need a new deal for a new generation.

We have also heard talk of reopening, with many closed sectors of the economy potentially starting again but what level of restart grants will be provided for those retail, hospitality and other services, such as hairdressers, that have been closed?

I raised the area of housing with the Taoiseach earlier, which is essential, including the rental sector, and also the affordability of accommodation.

That is a very expanded apprenticeship programme and internship programme, particularly within the State service.  The number of apprentices within Government agencies and semi-State bodies had declined.  The apprenticeship strategy now is designed to increase that to 750 per annum within the public service and State agencies but also to reach a figure of 10,000 apprentices per annum in the coming years, which will create opportunities for young people.  The recovery plan is designed to create a pathway towards employment creation in the coming years to get back to pre-pandemic employment levels over time.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputies Kelly and McDonald also asked about the opening up and easing of restrictions.  Both those Deputies had become converted to the zero-Covid strategy; I do not know what their views on that are now.  Prior to the end of March, we said that by the end of April we would consider the reopening of hairdressers and barbers, and that whole area of personal services.  We understand that hairdressers and barbers, in particular, have been under extraordinary pressures in respect of their businesses and enterprises.  We will obviously take health advice, but we want to be in a position next week where we can hopefully signal positive news to hairdressers and barbers, but that will obviously depend on how we progress in suppressing the virus in the coming period.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in reducing the numbers, particularly the numbers of people in hospital and in ICUs.  By and large, the people have adhered to the regulations and guidelines.  That has yielded dividends and has enabled us to be in a position to at least consider and examine the sectors that we could reopen.  A number of people identified that area.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the emerging economy, as I said, the green economy and digital transformation are two key themes.  My Department is also working on a well-being framework to analyse how society measures up, not just the economy and GDP but actually the quality of life within society.<\/p> <p>In all of the contributions, Deputies spoke about unemployment.  The level of State intervention in the past year has been unprecedented.  The level of supports from the State for workers in particular has been unprecedented and will continue.  The allocation this year for housing is in excess of &euro;3.3 billion, for homelessness in particular.  I agree we have more work to do in terms of homelessness.  Everything we do has to be within the law and within the constitutional framework.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows that, but tends to ignore it in all of his contributions and wants to brand the Government in a certain way.  The Government wants to reduce homelessness progressively and incrementally and we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100034#GG01200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619012100,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Stop the evictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100035#HH00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619012100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>There has been a 42% reduction in family homelessness in emergency accommodation, with a 19% reduction since the beginning of this year.  We want to continue to make progress on that front.  Expanding Housing First is a key initiative of ours which we will do.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is committed to doing that.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, there is need for, and there will be, a more active State in certain areas.  In the health service, it will be bigger.  It will far outdistance any other Department in terms of public expenditure.  There will be very significant projects within that.  There has to be a transformation of health service into the future.  Many serious initiatives have to be undertaken.  We have to learn lessons from Covid in regard to our health service, but it has stood up well.  The &euro;600 million we allocated before Christmas in terms of the winter initiative has been a very positive initiative which has not got the attention it deserves because of Covid, understandably, but it has resulted in certain initiatives that can be imbedded into the health service into the future in terms of primary care, community care and diagnostics, a better flow through the hospital system and a higher volume of home care packages, all of which have been provided this year arising from a huge allocation in terms of the health budget.<\/p>  <p>  We have provided protection for tenants that is consistent with the Constitution and the legal framework.  Without question, we have done that.  We also want to support sectors of the economy, such as the hospitality, tourism and aviation sectors, as we emerge from Covid.  Many Deputies spoke about low-paid employment and so on.  Some sectors have definitely suffered more than most.  We need to consider how we can help those sectors as we emerge from Covid.  We have made clear there will be no cliff edge from the existing supports, including the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other related supports around rates relief and so on.  They have all been extended until the end of June, when we will then consider, in the context of the national economic recovery plan, how we evolve those support schemes and what new initiatives we need to support those sectors that have suffered the most.  We intend to do that.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of initiatives here, including the recovery and resilience plan which we will submit to Brussels as part of the European-wide recovery and resilience.  Depending on how once prices it, over time Ireland stands to get approximately &euro;153 million from that initiative.  We will again focus on the green economy, creating jobs there, and on digital transformation and other initiatives to create jobs.  We are also applying for the Brexit adjustment reserve fund and it is hoped funding will come our way from that fund.  We have a number of initiatives to deal with the issues the Deputies have raised.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the living wage and Deputy Gannon's point, as a Government we have taken an initiative on that.  It has been referred to the Low Pay Commission for examination.  We want to progress that initiative.  It is an objective in the programme for Government.  In terms of the broader issue and the points raised by Deputy Paul Murphy, we want to create jobs in our economy and we want an economic model that works and creates jobs and incentivises enterprise, in particular small enterprises to facilitate them in growing their companies.  In terms of inward investment, since the beginning of the year, thousands of jobs have been announced, which is a good thing that then creates jobs in our indigenous sector as well.  We have supported workers to an unprecedented extent through the various interventions we have taken.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to JobPath and the local employment services and so on, the Minister for Social Protection will bring proposals in that respect to Government.  Again, our objective is to help workers but also to provide opportunities for them.  There are issues around public procurement we have to observe, but the Minister is hearing and listening to what is being said.  We understand the important work local employment services do and the contribution they have made to date.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the North-South interconnector, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has spoken about the review that is under way.  The Deputies' know the position of EirGrid.  It believes it cannot be undergrounded.  I have pointed to areas around the country where certain initiatives have been undergrounded.  The context is the all-island single energy market and so on.

In budget 2021, the Government announced the shared island fund, with &euro;500 million being made available out to 2025, ring-fenced for shared island projects.  This provides significant new capital funding for strategic investment in collaborative North-South projects that will support the commitments and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to progress existing and new cross-Border investment projects.  Our priorities for such investment are set out in the programme for Government.  Progressing cross-Border investment projects was a key focus of our discussions at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary on 18 December, and in December more than &euro;6 million in funding from the shared island fund was approved by the Government to launch the delivery of phase 2 of the Ulster Canal.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the shared island initiative, the unit is progressing a comprehensive research programme, working with the National Economic and Social Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, and the Irish Research Council, with research outputs being published through 2021 and in subsequent years.  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South, are key objectives of this work.  As I have said previously, our shared island initiative does not preordain any constitutional outcome under the Good Friday Agreement.  Our work takes place in that context.<\/p>  <p>  I launched the shared island dialogue series to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on a shared future on the island, founded on the Good Friday Agreement.  To date, three dialogues have been held.  I addressed a dialogue with young people on 26 November on the theme of New Generations and New Voices on the Good Friday Agreement, on 5 February, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications participated in a dialogue on climate and environment on the island, and on 25 March, a dialogue on civil society engagement on the island was held, with participation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The dialogue series will continue through this year, including with a focus on equality, economy, health and education issues for the island.  We are ensuring new and under-represented voices, including of women, young people and ethnic minorities, are represented in these civic discussions on our shared future on the island.<\/p>  <p>  Building a shared island will require co-operation at all levels, and I warmly welcome the increased focus and ambition for cross-Border co-operation at local authority and regional levels, including through the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor launched on 24 March, the framework of regional priorities of the Irish Central Border Area Network, also launched on 24 March, and the North West Regional Development Group's recently agreed statement of updated regional priorities.  I and a number of Ministers have engaged directly with these important cross-Border initiatives in recent weeks to affirm the Government's support for their work and readiness to collaborate with them, taking account of their regional development strategies and our commitments and objectives on a shared island as set out in the programme for Government.  The shared island unit in my Department is actively engaging with local authorities and the cross-Border local authority forums in follow-up.<\/p>  <p>  Ar deireadh, bh&iacute; pl&eacute; tairbheach ag aonad um oile&aacute;n comhroinnte mo Roinne le hionadaithe Gaeilge maidir leis an tionscnamh oile&aacute;n comhroinnte, agus t&aacute; cuireadh tugtha d&oacute;ibh a bheith p&aacute;irteach sa tsraith idirphl&eacute; maidir le hoile&aacute;n comhroinnte.

I am very relieved that the North-South Ministerial Council meeting on enterprise and innovation has gone head today, although it was really disappointing that the council meeting on transport failed to proceed last week.

I have heard talk of investment in universities.  In the past couple of weeks, as we saw members of certain communities rioting, it was clear that one of the many things they have in common, on both sides of the peace wall, is that they come from areas with an extremely low level of educational attainment.  Does the Taoiseach believe the shared island initiative can create investment that will finally start to address those issues?

Something else that is critical and can help us to unite people is taking a lead on the question of providing decent jobs.  I want to cite a particular example of where we are not taking the lead in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I have had reports recently from Dublin Port concerning certain Brexit-related operations that led to the employment of several hundred workers by Doyle Shipping Group.  From what I understand, it seems that these workers are, in effect, working for Revenue, the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Office of Public Works, but have been contracted out to Doyle Shipping Group, which is treating them absolutely disgracefully.  It has not paid them the hourly rates they are supposed to get, it is not giving them their proper overtime rates and it is unilaterally trying to change their contracts.  When some of the workers, including one who contacted me, questioned Doyle Shipping Group about this, they were sacked unceremoniously.  There was no consultation; they were just gone.  I assume these workers are being paid by Departments.  This does not exactly bode well in terms of how the State protects the rights of workers.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to know the details of this situation here and now but I ask that he look into it.  It is unacceptable that this sort of thing could be happening on what is, in effect, a Government-supported project and employment at Dublin Port.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100036#JJ00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619012700,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I spoke to the Taoiseach previously about the report of the Dublin-Belfast Economic Corridor group.  The report is produced by all the local authorities, North and South, in the area of the corridor, in conjunction with the University of Ulster and DCU.  It deals with all the positives the area enjoys, including infrastructure, a young and dynamic population and the existence of the various universities and learning institutes.  Thinking of the future for the likes of my own town of Dundalk, Drogheda and Newry, I see them as centres for innovation and enterprise even beyond what they are now.  There is a huge amount of potential for this area, which has been impacted greatly by partition and dealing with the outworking of issues associated with Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the proposals in the report would dovetail with the work, or what the work should be, of the shared island unit.  The Taoiseach spoke recently at a Dundalk and Newry chambers of commerce joint event on Brexit, where he referred to the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Newry southern relief road.  Will the Taoiseach give an update on those projects?  There is also the wider issue of the need for greater cross-Border rail connectivity.  Translink has indicated that we could have an improved Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service by 2024, with greater frequency and better rolling stock.  However, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann tells me that this will not be possible before 2026 or 2027.  We need to see whether there is any possibility of improving on those timelines.<\/p>  <p>  What issues are being impacted at this point in time as a result of the North-South Ministerial Council meeting on transport not being able to proceed because of the DUP not taking up its position?  I agree with the calls in this House regarding the necessity of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting.  We need the involvement of the two Governments at the top level.  There have been issues with rioting and such in the North.  There has obviously been a stoking of the situation by political unionism for political purposes.  However, we must remember that we are long removed from the unionist monster rallies against the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the 1980s and the spectre of Ulster resistance and such.  We are far removed from that.  We need leadership, a plan in regard to Irish unity and a conversation on what that would look like.<\/p>  <p>  For our communities, particularly working-class communities, North and South, nationalist, unionist and other, what is required are jobs.  It has been shown in much economic modelling that the real dividend that this island, North and South, could get directly from Irish unity would be an economic dividend and a jobs boost.  What we need at this point in time is leadership to ensure that happens.

There was an opportunity to put a unionist in the Seanad who would contribute to the ongoing debate, but the Taoiseach failed to take it up.<\/p>  <p>  It strikes me very evidently in my conversations on these issues with organisations, including many farming organisations and bodies that operate on a North-South and all-Ireland basis, many within the Border region specifically, that the debate around the constitutional question, as the Taoiseach framed it, is already happening apace.  People are having the discussions around dinner tables and in community centres.  Obviously, a lot of it is taking place in online Zoom and MS Teams meetings at the moment.<\/p> <p>The debate is happening everywhere except in the Department of the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach seems to be absolutely resistant to having a conversation on what a united Ireland might look like.  Many people are asking that simple question.  It does not have a simple answer but it is a question that people want to participate in.  The Taoiseach is doing a huge disservice to his position and office by refusing to create the space for that conversation to take place and I call on him to rethink it.  I also call on the Taoiseach to rethink some of what I would describe as the reckless language he has been using.  To describe as explosive the notion of having the implementation of one aspect of the Good Friday Agreement is, in my view, utterly reckless.  I ask the Taoiseach to move away from that and from yesterday's language.<\/p> <p> Let us start talking about the future of our country.  Those of us who want to see a united Ireland do not just have some notion of putting right the historical wrongs or some romantic fantasy or anything like that.  The reason we want to see a united Ireland is because we believe it will be a better Ireland for all who live here.  We believe it will create the capacity for us to address the inefficiencies within our healthcare system and other public services.  We believe it will allow us to develop a vibrant all-Ireland economy that serves all communities.  That is legitimate and positive in my view.  If we believe a united Ireland will be better for all the people in the country, then we not only have a right but an obligation to work towards it.

The gun was handed into the PSNI station in Armagh.  Some days later, the community followed up with people in the PSNI station to see whether the police service was investigating its provenance.  At that stage those in the PSNI station said the PSNI had not received any gun.  They denied any gun had been dropped into the station whatsoever.

Four days later, the PSNI admitted a gun had been left in with the ammunition.<\/p>  <p>  Shockingly, this is not the first time something like this has happened.

I have asked three taoisigh, namely, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, Deputy Leo Varadkar and Mr. Enda Kenny, to meet victims and survivors of the Glenanne murder gang.  To date, no Taoiseach has agreed to meet or accept the invite of those victims.  I understand it has been difficult for the Taoiseach and I am not putting any blame on him.  Covid-19 has got in the way of his ability to do it.  However, I would ask that, even if it is through MS Teams or Zoom, we start the conversation around those families in their search for justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100037#KK00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1619013300,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I fully agree with what Deputy Richmond said in terms of the need for strong continuing dialogue.  I am always open to dialogue and conversation on issues pertaining to the future of this island and to all of the questions relating to that.  Indeed I have been open to them since the beginning of my political career when I was elected a councillor and Deputy.  I do not need Deputy Carthy to lecture me on my interest or engagement in this issue.  I think Deputy Richmond's point about the three sets of relationships, namely, the British-Irish, the North-South and the two traditions, is important.  They underpin the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to fulfil that potential, and in my view it has not been fulfilled to date.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has had some good and useful meetings in London this week.  I spoke to all the leaders of the political parties last week and had good conversations in respect of the issues that arose in the previous week.  We are continuing that engagement.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gannon made a point on education and early school leaving, and I agree with it 100%.  One of the failings since the Good Friday Agreement has been the inability of the Northern Ireland Executive, along with the two Governments, to carry out a major investment programme in school completion to prevent early school leaving in the communities that need investment the most.  Maybe at the time it should have been contemplated.  That is something I am passionately committed to.  There are serious issues in terms of early school leaving, non-school completion and non-progression to further and third level education in conurbations within Northern Ireland.  That is a problem.  Many representatives of the universities have said this to me and many educationalists have said this to me as well.  If we do not address that, we will continue to sow challenges and problems for the future.<\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of the specific incident Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised, but obviously decent jobs a decent economy are key to the North-South relationship.  That is part of what the shared island is about.  It is to increase connectivity and get good projects flowing.  I am not aware of the specifics of the situation pertaining at Dublin Port.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made another point and again I can reference the various projects we are pursuing.  We have already allocated resources to research projects.  We are looking at North-South industrial projects in terms of city deals, commitments to an industrial estate in Derry and parallel development in Letterkenny and Donegal.  The idea is that there will be a joint initiative in the region around industrial promotion, creation of jobs and rail connectivity.<\/p>  <p>  I heard what Deputy Carthy said.  To be fair, Sinn F&eacute;in will be past masters at Seanad deals and are no strangers to them, whereas what happened today was an open democratic election that was transparent from the get-go.  We do not need that kind of cynical commentary on what is a properly conducted bona fide election.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also referred to creating space for discussion.  Let me repeat the point that I have created a lot of space for discussion.  The shared Ireland dialogue series is to create space for people to have a discussion without preconditions about how we share this island in future and how we live together in a better way than we have lived in the past.  For example, we still have too many peace walls in Northern Ireland.  We have to work hard at this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry commented using the old trope about establishment politicians, whoever they are.  We live in a parliamentary democracy.  We have an electoral system that elects people by direct franchise.  Then the Parliament elects the Government.  Often, I think that phrase \"the establishment\" is a con job and has no real meaning other than to try to brand people and undermine the status of people as if they are some sort of alien group who are against the people.  It is a completely false proposition.<\/p>  <p>  I will meet with the victims and families to discuss the actions of Glenanne group.  If we can arrange that, I will certainly facilitate it.  I have met some in opposition but that would have been in a different context.  I am not aware of the specifics in terms of the issue around the gun being handed in to the PSNI.  I will finish on a broader point.  It is important, given all that has been achieved in respect of policing in Northern Ireland, that we continue to support the PSNI and express confidence in the PSNI and its capacity to police fairly and impartially on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100037#KK00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Order for Second Stage","time":1619013900,"counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100038#LL00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619013900,"counter":243,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1619013900,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100038#LL00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1619013900,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100038#LL00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1619013900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>It is not agreed.

It is rushed and ill-conceived, and it looks grand and dandy and is nice to pander to the public and to our friends in Europe and elsewhere, but reality has been left aside.  There is no real understanding or assessment as to an impact of this on every man, woman and child.  We have figures, independently verified, that it is going to add almost &euro;90 in costs for every man, woman and child in the country.  Those costs are coming in the middle of a pandemic and we do not know the impact that it will have, yet the Minister is rushing to enact the legislation.  We see a scarcity of materials every day of the week which we cannot obtain.  Raw materials that were being harvested are being denied, like turf and many other issues.

It is time, five years after the signing of the Paris climate agreement, for us to start to show real ambition and bring this home.  It is also time for hope.  There is some hope in this country these days that we may be able to manage the worst of this Covid-19 pandemic and start to see days that are slightly brighter than the hard days we have seen in the past year and a half.  The issues of our health and our treatment of our climate are inextricably linked.  Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization has said that, from his extensive experience, pandemics are coming because we have not, in our time, protected the natural world.  The destruction of the biome, as he puts it, is the reason we are seeing these pandemics coming at us in a way that is destroying our lives.<\/p><p>There are health connections and benefits from the actions we will take.  We will have a more active social transport system.  We will have clean air because we will not burn fossil fuels, thereby protect our lungs, hearts and heads.  We will build a connection to nature which is one thing we have seen in this time of Covid when the protection of nature has become all the more real, important and special to us.  It is clearly time for us to act because the natural world is in crisis and being destroyed before our eyes.  We have witnessed it within my lifetime and must stop it.  That is the biggest risk and challenge.  It puts Covid in the shade in terms of the risks that it brings to our people.  It is for that reason we are seeing other countries starting to step up and say they too want to act.  I believe there were some signs of hope yesterday, as there are today and, I hope, there will be tomorrow.  The UK Government has expressed real ambition in what it is going to do.  The EU stated earlier today that it is going to set ambitious targets for action on climate.  The US Government is likely to do the same tomorrow.  These are massive, dramatic and significant changes to how we address climate change.  When I attend tomorrow's leaders' summit on climate action, called by President Biden, I am glad that I will be able to say with certainty on behalf of Ireland that we share that ambition and stand up for climate justice.  I will say that we are ready to stand up as a signatory to the Paris climate agreement and turn that into real action and give it meaning and force.  I will do so humbled by the knowledge that by any comparison, our <i>per capita <\/i>emissions are high.  We must show significant change in how we are addressing these matters but I believe we can and will do that.  The vote we have just taken signifies that our people are ready for this.  We are ready to show leadership and will no longer be called laggards.  We are ready and it is time for us to act on climate change.<\/p><p>I am proud of the Green Party's role in this.  For 40 years, we have stood on a ticket that we are in a moment of ecological crisis and must react.  We have stood on the understanding that the solution to that crisis has to come from democratic, peaceful and participative politics.  Is l&aacute; f&iacute;or-stairi&uacute;l &eacute; don Comhaontas Glas.  It is a proud day for our party and for the thousands of people with whom we have worked over the years to bring this sort of legislation to this floor.<\/p> <p>I am glad it is time that the Bill is read a Second Time.<\/p> <p> But it is not just our party: the key point is that it is consensual and that it is broadly accepted.  This involves everyone.  Every place is going to matter.  What gives me real confidence is what has happened to this country in the past five years and the politics of climate change.  Starting with that Citizens' Assembly where, on a scientific basis, we brought in 100 citizens, presented the best evidence and analysis and then stood back as they came back to us with really ambitious recommendations.  That was behind what has ended up here today as we read this Bill for the Second Time.<\/p> <p> I am very proud of the Oireachtas and the way we set up an Oireachtas joint committee to work on this on a participative, collective and collaborative basis, and the really good work it did in the previous Oireachtas.  It is time for the Bill to be read because the Chairman, Deputy Leddin, and the committee members have put in the time.  The committee sat for 50 hours in private session and it had weeks of hearings when it brought in the best experts.  It is time we read the Bill now on Second Stage, taking into account the 78 amendments the committee recommended, the vast majority of which have been implemented in the Bill.<\/p> <p> It is time as well to thank the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, our coalition partners in government, because they do get it.  They really believe that as a country we can be good at this and their support and commitment in the programme for Government was critical in getting the legislation to this Stage.  I look forward to working with them on implementing the provisions that we are about to legislate for.  I say the same to every other party because this is not a Bill that just applies to this Oireachtas or this Government, this is something that will be there to guide at least six if not seven or more Governments over the next 30 years.  It must not be a stop-start change, but it must be consistent, collective and agreed upon.<\/p> <p> If we are to thank anyone for getting to this Stage in reading this Bill today for the Second Time, I wish to single out the students, teachers and their friends and families who stood outside the D&aacute;il every Friday in rail, hail, sleet and snow for so long and were part of the international movement of young students who stood up and said it was time for them to act, that another world was possible and that they are unstoppable when they think in that way.  I thank them on our behalf in this Oireachtas because I think it was their influence at a critical time in this country and across the world that set the scene which allowed for those more ambitious targets that will be discussed at President Biden's meeting tomorrow, in the European Union today and that was discussed in the UK yesterday.  To my mind, they are the ones who deserve the credit for this legislation and they are the ones who will have to implement most of it, who will be the beneficiaries of the real, positive and hopeful developments this legislation will bring.  Not only does it protect us from the risk climate change brings, it also delivers a new energy economy where we in this country have a comparative competitive advantage.  There are jobs for young people in this.  Their digital skills will be key in how we do efficiency.  It will lead to balanced regional development because our power will be dispersed right across the country.  The Rural Independents know that.  This is going to be the future for the west, south west, north west, east and midlands.  This is going to be good for rural Ireland.  I am absolutely convinced of that.<\/p> <p> It is also going to be good for the transport system, electrifying it and using our own power supplies rather than buying it in from abroad.  It is a social transformation because it will be a modal shift towards public transport and active travel, which creates a stronger sense of community and connection and reduces the amount of travel we have to do.<\/p> <p> This is the future for Irish agriculture.  It will mean the protection of the Irish family farm.  This is the chance for us to pay a whole generation of young new farmers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100040#NN00200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619014800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>It will wipe them out.

This is going to put them to the test.  This legislation, more than anything else, is going to put significant demands on them.  I will set out in the provisions how they will do their work and what they are going to do in the next 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  As is proper procedure during the Second Reading of the Bill I will now set out the provisions in the Bill.  At the core of this Bill is the national climate objective, which commits the State to pursue and achieve a transition to a climate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate-neutral economy by no later than 2050.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill defines a climate-neutral economy as a sustainable economy and society where greenhouse gas emissions in the State are balanced or exceeded by the removal of greenhouse gases.  This commitment is clear and consistent with delivering on our obligations under the Paris climate agreement.  That is what we are implementing in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill as a whole, and not only the national climate objective, is underpinned by our international obligations and informed by science.  The Bill requires the Government to carry out its functions under the Bill in a manner consistent with the objectives of, and the State's obligations to, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Article 2 and 4(1) of the Paris Agreement, and which also takes account of Ireland's greenhouse gas inventory and projection reports.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill reflects the need to provide a strong and clear governance framework to achieve its ambition and will permanently cement a strengthened statutory framework to drive this transformative change over time.  To this end, the Bill provides that the State must, first, prepare five-year carbon budgets, which cover all of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions; apportion each five-year carbon budget among key emitting sectors and establish emission ceilings for those sectors; define the key Ministers responsible for achieving emissions reductions in these sectors and make them accountable for doing so; prepare an annual climate action plan that describes the actions every Minister will take to achieve his or her sectoral emissions ceilings; and develop a national long-term climate action strategy at least every five years that describes the mitigation and adaptation policies that we will put in place towards meeting the national climate objective.<\/p>  <p>  There is recognition of the need for early action.  Realising the importance of near-to-medium term action to enable the achievement of climate neutrality by mid-century, the Bill ensures our efforts are front-loaded and provides that the first two carbon budgets will provide a 51% reduction in the annual level of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  This enacted commitment, which will be one of the most ambitious of any developed country, is informed by climate science and in line with the increased ambition at EU level and the commitment in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100041#OO01300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1619014800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The national herd will be reduced by 51%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100041#OO01400","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1619014800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Our increased ambition to 2030, in law, will ensure that for the first time Ireland goes beyond just setting targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100041#OO01500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1619014800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The Minister should tell the farmers that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100041#OO01600","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1619014800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The Minister should be allowed to speak without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100041#OO01700","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1619014800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>It instead guarantees, to the best extent possible, that we deliver on our fair share of the global effort, in essence, providing real climate justice.<\/p>  <p>  Of key significance in this Bill is the embedding, in a statutory process, of carbon budgeting and sectoral emission targets.

I will provide a copy of it as soon as I can.  Out of respect to all Deputies here, let us hear each other and listen.  I will set out the provisions of the Bill, which I am in the middle of doing, and I ask for the right to finish that process.  Deputies will have the speech as soon as we can deliver it to them.<\/p>  <p>  The joint committee will be informed by the latest projections and inventories prepared by the EPA and by the annual report of the Climate Change Advisory Council, which will also now include an assessment of compliance with the carbon budget and sectoral emissions ceilings for that period.  The annual update to the climate action plan complements this process and provides an opportunity to include new and updated or corrective actions, where necessary, to adjust and ensure compliance with the carbon budget and sectoral emissions ceilings.  Through regular reporting of progress and a shared responsibility for the tasks ahead, we will deliver the change required, realise our long-term climate objectives and achieve our EU and international obligations. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition that climate action will be an iterative process over many decades, the Bill provides that the climate action plan will be reviewed and updated annually and that we will adjust our measures, if necessary, to ensure we remain on track.  The annual climate action plan will be aligned to the adopted three five-year carbon budgets.  It will set out the actions and measures to be achieved in each five-year budget and the associated sectoral targets assigned. <\/p>  <p>  The national long-term climate action strategy will look at the long-term pathways to achieve the 2050 target.  As science and technology evolves these pathways will be expected, in turn, to evolve over time.  It is appropriate, therefore, that this long-term strategy be updated at least every five years, <\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise that while this direction of change will bring many opportunities, it will also present some challenges that we will need to address in our transition.  Regular dialogue and listening to individuals, communities and different economic sectors will be a critical feature of this approach.  The Bill provides, therefore, for extensive consultation in the development of carbon budgets and future plans and strategies, ensuring effective public participation at all key steps of the process.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will have a transformative effect on our climate policy ambitions and implementation.  In order to achieve such a transformation, we must ensure that there are clear obligations that compel Government, Ministers and public bodies to act.  To this end, the Bill requires Ministers and the Government to perform their functions in a manner that is, insofar as is practicable, consistent with the carbon budgets that are in effect.  Each Minister is also required to comply in a similar manner with adopted sectoral emissions ceilings and relevant plans and strategies.  Consistent with this approach, public bodies will also have a general obligation to perform their functions, insofar as is practicable, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the various plans and strategies under the legislation, and to further the achievement of the national climate objective. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill requires local authorities to prepare their own climate action plans every five years.  These plans will be consistent with national climate plans and will include mitigation and adaptation measures.  In order to ensure appropriate alignment between the local authority climate action plans and their development plans, the Bill amends the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide that the approved local authority climate action plan is taken into account in the preparation of any future development plan.  These requirements ensure that climate action will be integrated into policy-making and implementation at all levels of public administration in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I would like some extra time to finish the speech and go through all the provisions in the Bill, recognising that some of my time was lost mid speech.<\/p> <p>His time was not lost.

We have already had one vote on it and we will have plenty of discussion and many more votes.  It is acknowledged this Bill benefited greatly from the pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Climate Action before Christmas, which was ably chaired by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Leddin.  The climate committee members worked on a cross-party basis, heard from a wide range of experts, in private and public, and made 78 recommendations to the Minister with a view to improving and strengthening this Bill.  Many of these recommendations have been incorporated in the Bill before us today, which is welcome.  However, while this version is a considerable improvement on the draft Bill, we believe there is room for further improvement, and we will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  This is landmark legislation which will outlive any one Administration, so it is important we get it right at this stage.  It is important to set the targets and the framework to get us there.  The Minister will have received correspondence in recent days from Professors John Sweeney and Barry McMullin and Dr. Andrew Jackson outlining some concerns about the Bill, principally its failure, legally or scientifically, to place the commitment of the programme for Government for the period 2021 to 2030 on a secure statutory basis.  They argue the language used in section 9 is legally uncertain and could give rise to contradictory interpretations.  Given the limited time I have and the fact the Minister has no doubt read the letter and considered its contents, I will not articulate its contents in full but I ask that he might, in his concluding remarks, address the points raised in it and whether he intends to amend the section accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The shift in public awareness on climate issues and the appetite for change in recent years has been a really positive development.  The youth climate strikes that took place globally and across Ireland before Covid-19, demonstrated the desire for our younger generations for a significant step change in how the State and the private sector approach our environment and deal with the climate crisis.  It is essential we listen to people on climate action.  It is often noted the public are usually ahead of politicians on issues, and none more so than the need to address the climate emergency.  People want change.  They want green energy, warmer homes, better transport, cleaner air and unpolluted rivers, but they also want this transition to zero carbon to be fair.  This is where this and previous Governments have failed.  People know this transition will take personal change on their behalf, but they want to see the Government pulling its weight and big polluters doing their share of the heavy lifting, and that has not been happening to date.<\/p>  <p>  Ordinary people have been an easy target for the Government, and they have been hit again and again.  Ask most people what they think of when they hear climate action and reducing our emissions and many will answer it is one cost after another, in rural and in urban Ireland: carbon tax, higher electricity and heating bills, and increased fuel costs at the forecourts.  They will also point out how major corporations and vested interests have shirked their responsibilities, enabled by light touch regulation.  Take electricity use.  Hundreds of thousands of families live in fuel and energy poverty, struggling to keep the electricity bills down as a result of the huge carbon tax and public service obligation levy increases this year, but then they see data centres that use enough energy to power a town springing up with reckless abandon.  Government action to date has not been fair or equitable when it comes to reducing our overall emissions.  Ordinary people feel they are hit again and again while others continue to get a free ride.  That has to change, and if it does not, we will fail.<\/p>  <p>  Climate action does not have to have such negative connotations for people; indeed, quite the opposite.  It can deliver huge benefits.  It can and should bring about progressive change and transformation: new green jobs, warmer homes, better health outcomes, cheaper and cleaner ways of getting to school or work, cleaner air and rivers, greater connection to place and community and to the environment, additional income for local communities and businesses through selling excess wind energy, and the list goes on.<\/p>  <p>  While this Bill is about the framework governing the targets and reductions and does not deal with the specific measures that will help us achieve them, the specific measures must be inclusive in rural and urban Ireland, they must be fair and they must ensure a just transition is always a priority.  This approach must also extend to jobs that will be lost due to our transition to green energy.  The ESB&rsquo;s announcement earlier this month on its Green Atlantic at Moneypoint plan provides an example of how this shift can not only protect jobs but also bring significant new investment and potential to a region.  The &euro;5 billion plan to convert the coal power plant into a green energy hub, together with offshore floating wind and green hydrogen production and storage facilities, is an incredibly impressive plan that, if delivered, will bring huge benefits to the region as well as ensuring workers at Moneypoint and in the local community are not left behind as the burning of coal ends.  We can and should be leaders in this field.<\/p>  <p>  Workers in Bord na M&oacute;na and the midlands, by comparison, have been failed miserably by successive governments.  They have been sold a green pup or a climate pup.  As peat production winds up in the midlands, we need government intervention and financial support to ensure workers there are supported with new training and new opportunities.  That has to happen or we are lost.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the provisions that seek to engage the public on our climate approach and seek people's input and views.  However, more public consultation that acts as just a box-ticking exercise and ignores what is put forward by ordinary people will be a total waste of everyone&rsquo;s time.  Engagement must be meaningful.  There will not always be agreement but it is about working with the public, respecting them and bringing them along.<\/p> <p>In my constituency, the North-South interconnector is a case in point.  It is an important piece of energy infrastructure.  The public want it but want it underground.  For 15 years, they have been making that case.  It is entirely feasible but EirGrid and successive Governments have preferred to bully local communities rather than engage with them.  Where is that project?  It is nowhere, and that is where it is going to stay unless EirGrid and the Government change tack.  The communities along the route are still adamant that they do not want 50 m high pylons carrying 400 kV lines next to their homes, but EirGrid and the Government have ignored public opinion and the clear evidence which shows the underground alternative is technically feasible, affordable and deliverable.  In fact, it is the only way this project will be delivered.  The approach has infuriated local communities and only serves to paralyse important projects.  No amount of propaganda or advertising expenditure can hide that.  I ask the Minister to learn from this.  What is being done is no way of doing business.  If he continues in this vein, we will not have a hope of meeting our emissions and renewables targets.  It will be a constant battle between communities and the Government instead of collaboration.<\/p> <p> As my party's transport spokesperson I am particularly interested in what we need to do to reduce the 20% contribution of the transport sector to our overall emissions.  Public transport will be a key aspect, and significant investment in infrastructure, fleet expansion and replacement is needed to accelerate the modal shift from car to bus or train.  There is a huge unmet need, including in respect of school bus transport, that the Government seems intent on continuing to ignore.  This must be addressed.  Similarly, communities in the west have been advocating for the western rail corridor for years and people in Meath, like me, have been arguing for rail transport to Dublin.  People want to leave their cars at home but, owing to a lack of investment in public transport for decades, they have little option.  These are just a few examples of key public transport interventions that can deliver significant environmental benefits and boost investment in jobs and tourism in areas but that have been bogged down in review after review with no progress.<\/p> <p> As mentioned, we will be making several amendments on Committee Stage with a view to addressing shortcomings we believe remain.  Some that were already mentioned relate to interim targets.  Our amendments will also strengthen the Bill in terms of its obligation to achieve a just transition and provide certainty on the appointments process for the Climate Change Advisory Council and on the issue of fracked gas and the role of the public in shaping their carbon future.  I hope there will be an opportunity for further refinement and I look forward to working with the Minister and others from across this House to continue to improve this really important Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100043#QQ02000","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619016600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I would like to follow Deputy O'Rourke in offering general support for this climate Bill.  We believe, however, there is room for improvement, and in this regard we will be making amendments on Committee Stage.  There is nobody who does not accept the reality of climate change and its impact.  I accept the Minister's statement that we are dealing with a pandemic that may have resulted from the fact we have absolutely failed to look after the natural world.  The necessary buzzwords relate to the fact we need to make changes but that it needs to be sustainable and renewable.  We need full support in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We have noted that there will be differing views on this Bill and the climate change measures that need to be pushed through.  There is an element of failure on the part of the Government and others to sell the reality of what they are offering to people.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned the great need for public consultation.  In this regard, we think of rural Ireland, agriculture and bodies such as the IFA and others that represent farmers' views.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Carthy, when he was still an MEP, and I attended a meeting of Louth IFA in Monasterboice.  One of the issues on the table, with which the IFA was dealing, related to accepting that changes were required, accepting the circumstances in which we found ourselves and admitting we needed to tackle climate change.  There was much discussion and the farmers talked about the huge issue of their work on biodiversity and so on not always being recognised or taken into account when talking about Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments and other matters.  At the meeting, there was a group of people who saw change was coming down the line but who needed interaction with the Government, not in the sense of the Government pontificating to them but in the sense of offering solutions.  We all accept we need to deal with emissions and we need targets.  We all accept we need interim targets and some element of policing in that regard, but we also have to offer people the benefits of the Green New Deal.  We have to offer individuals benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax has not done any great favours.  It is just seen as a tax on poor people.  We have not given people the alternatives.  We do not yet have retrofit programs that are fit for purpose.  We need to deal with all these issues.  There is an onus on the Government to sell this.  There are changes that are necessary but we need a conversation with all the stakeholders.  Otherwise, we will have nothing but strife.  Deputy O'Rourke said that all people hear when there is talk of climate changes is cost and more cost.  They have to see a roadmap that takes their needs and wants into consideration.  They need a sustainable roadmap that delivers for the natural world and us and that offers sustainable transport, particularly public transport.  We also need solutions in this regard on a North&ndash;South basis.  I would like the Minister to address that issue.  I accept there are difficulties at the minute in that we have not been able to have a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  I hope this, among many other issues we are dealing with, can be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about a Bill that we can enact with no worry but we are consistently being told we need to sign up to the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  The difficulty with that is the investor court system.  We have a difficulty with the legislation because it did not deal with fracking, for example.  If we were to ban the importation of fracked gas, we could leave ourselves open if we were to sign up to the investor court system.  All agreements being made internationally at the minute are moving away from investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS.  On the question of continuing with the provisional application that exists, it is a matter of not hampering ourselves and of giving ourselves the power to bring about real and meaningful change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100044#RR00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1619016600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I welcome the Second Stage reading of this Bill.  It is not exactly what we had hoped for and worked for during pre-legislative scrutiny.  We had hoped for and anticipated we would now have a climate Bill that would set out clear and ambitious targets and make the Government accountable for delivering on them.  Can the Government be accountable when the recent High Court ruling on the Climate and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 found the Government was not a relevant body?  That is less of a loophole and more of a gigantic hole.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have written to the Minister calling for it to be closed immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Climate change is now inevitable; it is a fact.  All we are trying to do in this legislation is lessen and make more bearable its effects on our children and grandchildren.  By that, I mean future generations of the whole world.  Young people are miles ahead of us, as adults and legislators.  We really are the laggards in living up to the climate reality and our responsibilities.  This week, we heard about the vanishing of the A-68a glacier in Antarctica not even four years since it broke away from the Larsen C ice shelf.  It is the natural work of millennia reduced in relative moments.  The young people in north Kildare know the choices we make matter across the world because we are all in this world together.  With climate change, there is nowhere to hide; Earth is our only home.<\/p> <p>Everything that has happened in human history has happened on this planet and we owe it to the generations who made us and to the generations we, as humanity, will become to do all in our power to protect it.<\/p> <p> In that context, I am bitterly disappointed with the just transition aspect of the Bill.  I assure my constituents in Kildare North, young and not so young, and the Fridays for Future groups who have been so active, particularly in my town of Maynooth, that we will do our utmost to change it.  We went from having no mention of a just transition in the first draft to having one mere reference to it in the Bill before us, despite the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We have tried to change the language in the Bill in respect of a just transition.  There are weasel-word terms such as \"best endeavours\", \"as far as is practicable\" and \"have regard to\".  They are useless.  There is just too much wriggle room.  The meaning, however, is clear.  The comfortable and privileged can transition, retrofitting their second homes without breaking a financial sweat, while the people barely hanging on can do it only insofar as is practicable.  I ask the Minister for whom is it practicable.  Sinn F&eacute;in will fight for a just transition and decarbonisation as a right for all, regardless of income.  Scotland got it right in its climate Act.  There is an entire section on just transition principles, that is, things to stand over, not like these kinds of weasel words.  They are not enough.  We need engagement with workers and communities to ensure we get the buy-in necessary to take this over the line.<\/p> <p> I have other concerns.  That the importation of fracked gas will continue after the passing of any climate Bill is ludicrous.  It needs to be banned immediately by legislation before the Government tries to ratify the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, or before any other sneakily timed licence applications are made.  The Minister said he would bring in a ban on fracked gas and he needs to do it.  Equally, the Government needs to get moving on reaching our targets without any more slouching around.  Near-term ambition is vital.  There is a significant shortfall of ambition compared with what was promised in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p> As for reaching our interim targets as quickly as possible, we share the concerns of Professor John Sweeney, Dr. Andrew Jackson and Professor Barry McMullin in their letter to the Minister and his coalition partners.  For amendment purposes, we are assessing the two options they outlined.  Regarding the Climate Change Advisory Council, we welcome Ms Patricia King from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, as a voice for workers, but I was taken aback that our recommendation arising from pre-legislative scrutiny that there be an open public appointments process was effectively ignored.  The Minister might think he is getting away with it while he is in office and making the appointments, but if he is replaced by a Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Minister, that could change.  We quite simply have to have an open public appointments process.<\/p> <p> Finally, yesterday's warning from the International Energy Agency on an historic increase in emissions in the first quarter of 2021 was dire.  Any climate gains made during the pandemic have been trashed by the industrial addiction to coal internationally.  As it stands, the Bill does not scream real, radical or urgent change, and it should.  There is no reason for us not to do all we can in the Bill to fulfil our responsibilities.  We must examine our addiction to the economic growth that capitalism demands and to the relentless pursuit of profit for the remarkably few.  That is the real inconvenient truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100044#RR00300","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619017200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have just received a written copy of the Minister's contribution because, unfortunately, I did not get to hear a large part of it.  From what I did hear, the Bill means an awful lot to the Minister and the Green Party, and that needs to be acknowledged.  This is a big piece of work and it is clear from his opening contribution that this, while not the culmination because there is much work ahead, is a big moment for him and his party.  It is great finally to have an opportunity to speak to the Bill on Second Stage because it feels like it has been a long time coming.  It is right to acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  Unfortunately, I am not a member of the committee but the work it did was fantastic.  It is a credit to the Parliament that a committee can work in such a way to make changes to a Bill before it comes before the House.  Whether I spend one term, six terms or however many terms in the House, very few Bills, if any, will be as important or have such an impact as this one.<\/p><p>The Bill is not just about today or tomorrow; it is about the very existence and sustainability of our communities, our country and, if its principles are applied in other countries, the planet.  Climate change is being experienced globally in dramatic ways and that is clear to see, but it is also being experienced in this country in dramatic ways, with flooding, extreme weather events in summer and winter and coastal erosion.  It is not something that is just for sub-Saharan Africa, the outback in Australia or South America; it is everywhere, including here.  That is why the Bill is important and it is why we welcome it and will work on Committee and Remaining Stages to bring amendments to strengthen it.  Hopefully, some of those amendments, if not all of them, will be taken on board.<\/p><p>A number of issues remain of great concern and we believe they will work to weaken the integrity of the Bill, possibly undermining future climate action plans and carbon budgets.  The understanding of climate justice as outlined in the Bill is very weak and there is only one mention of a just transition.  Even this one mention seems both narrow and constrained in definition and ambition.  We would like the definition of climate justice to be amended to recognise the need for equitable responses to the climate and biodiversity crisis that address inequalities and incorporate human rights at their core.  The just transition principles should be defined as a framework for interventions that support affected workers and communities.  These principles should be the foundation for all climate action plans and activities of public bodies under the Bill.<\/p><p>While the Bill has been strengthened and the Government has listened to some concerns, it needs to listen more.  It needs to review the submissions made to the climate action committee from NGOs, trade unions and those working with the marginalised and vulnerable.  I ask the Minister to examine many of them but in particular that given by the Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation centre, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice.  The submission was informed by work with communities who experience poverty, social exclusion and inequality.  They called on the Government to strengthen the definitions of climate justice and a just transition, and we can look to the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, as amended over the years, for a better way to do this.  We can do this on Committee Stage and it must be done.<\/p><p>There must also be a strong reference to promoting sustainable development in line with the UN's sustainable development goals, which is also notably absent from the Bill.  When talking about climate justice and just transition, we need to listen to those who work with those on the very edge of society.  The Bill, as it stands, does not reflect that and we believe it can do more.  On the issue of workers, the appointment of ICTU general secretary, Ms Patricia King, to the just transition advisory committee is very welcome.  Ensuring an outcome that works for all workers is at the core of how we tackle climate change.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to giving statutory effect to ending the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of gas.  The Government has indicated that the commitment will be provided for in legislation on Committee Stage.  Why not include it for debate on Second Stage?  Why will the Government not impose a ban on LNG infrastructure being developed to facilitate the importation of fracked gas?  The programme for Government included an explicit commitment to bringing this forward as a policy to end the importation of fracked gas and LNG.  This gap must be addressed in the Bill and the Government must publish a comprehensive plan to ban the importation of fracked gas and, specifically, to ban LNG terminals in Ireland within 2021.<\/p><p>Overall, I believe that the weaknesses in this area are due to the influence of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  The Minister paid tribute to them and that is understandable, but the two parties need to stop playing an overall-defensive game when it comes to climate change.  Instead of defending the <i>status quo<\/i>, they need to embrace ambition and understand that if we are to meet our targets, not only will one or two sections of our society need to change but all of it will need to do so.  If we are to meet our targets as set out in the Bill, we need to be honest with ourselves.  If we are to reduce our emissions by 7% annually, as is the target, we must begin to visualise what that will look like.  Ireland and how we live our lives will not look the same if we meet our 7% annual targets.  How we live, travel, commute, work, socialise and everything else will look and be very different.<\/p><p>Over the past year, we have experienced an Ireland that was unrecognisable.  It changed to both our eye and our lived experience.  Industrial activity dropped, transport use decreased and during the most stringent lockdowns, the roads were quiet.  We will all tell future generations about how quiet the streets were and the impact of Covid-19 on our lives, how people spoke of being able to hear nature again and how our natural environment re-asserted itself in our built communities.<\/p> <p>We experienced a quieter, slower paced Ireland and this was replicated in many countries and regions all over the world.  All that decrease in activity ultimately equated to a carbon reduction of 6.4% globally and 5.9% in Ireland.  A unique global event like the Covid pandemic, about which we will be speaking for generations and which slowed the pace at which we live our lives, only resulted in a carbon reduction of just shy of 6%.<\/p> <p> Over the past year, there has been a massive decrease in transport emissions but this was offset by increased home energy consumption while food production and agriculture remained constant.  Transport, agriculture, home energy and large industry are the four areas responsible for the vast majority of our emissions and each will require ambitious programmes of assistance and reform if we are to be a climate leader and shake our title of climate laggard.<\/p> <p> The pandemic has highlighted just how committed individuals are in wanting to restore our biodiversity, improve our environment and save our planet.  We see it with every planting of a wildflower meadow or pollinator patch and with the uptick in active travel, the use of electric scooters and cycling.  People want to reduce their carbon footprint but they need assistance.  <\/p> <p> In the area of home retrofitting, the plan to spend &euro;8.7 billion on 500,000 deep retrofits in addition to the installation of 400,000 renewable heating systems in homes is daunting but it must be carried out.  Up to this point, the retrofitting of homes was the preserve of the well-off.  The poor and those struggling to make ends meet simply cannot afford to even think about retrofitting their homes.  It is now accepted that the SEAI support schemes that have existed over recent years were not sufficiently geared towards meeting our targets.  The retrofit programmes for which funds were allocated in the Government's latest budget, including the one-stop-shop for people to apply for subsidies for heat pumps, solar panels and insulation, need to be fast-tracked.  These programmes must be State-led and the cost to people must be negligible.  If the carbon tax is to be retained, this is what it should be spent on.  <\/p> <p> There is added value to be obtained from such programmes if they include robust apprenticeship opportunities with a focus on the trade crafts.  Other elements of government are also focusing on this.  I have concerns about some elements of that, but we need an improved State-led apprenticeship scheme and we can use the retrofitting of our homes to that end.  The trade unions have done a lot of work in that space and I ask that more of their input be taken on board.  Our net targets for reduction will not be met unless retrofitting is conducted on an ambitious scale.<\/p> <p> Agriculture remains a real point of discussion and contention that needs to be resolved.  We have seen issues in this sector informing today's debate.  We have a good understanding of how to drive down emissions generally but this remains a challenge with regard to agriculture.  There is a fair and just solution for farmers.  Labour wants to create a farming and diversification scheme to help boost farm families' incomes and to promote alternative sustainable uses of farmland.  The Government could also look at supports to help with farm modernisation and to help the next generation of young farmers.  Such supports could include the reintroduction of the early retirement scheme, extending the second targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, beyond 2020, and implementing a standardised and simplified hedge cutting grant scheme.  Helping farmers to diversify into areas such as biofuel and ensuring that such diversification is rewarded with a good living is vital.  <\/p> <p> Some people are drawing pretty stark battle lines in this area.  This is unhelpful and will help nobody.  We cannot allow it to happen.  Our agriculture industry is suffering as a result of climate change.  Flood risk and extreme weather events have challenged the ability of our farmers to pursue traditional farming methods and such challenges will only intensify if we do not tackle climate change effectively.  I represent a constituency with a large and growing agricultural sector and have seen at first hand the enthusiasm of those communities and workers to embrace change.  They do, however, need assistance and assurance that their livelihoods will not be impacted.<\/p> <p> With regard to transport, we know the solution.  We need greater uptake of, and greater investment in, public transport.  It still does not feel like we are being ambitious enough to get there.  Commuting was not working for commuters before Covid.  One in ten workers spent more than an hour travelling to work every day, with commuter losing an average of five hours per week stuck in traffic.  Dublin was the third worst city in the world for congestion, which is not only bad for our economy and for workers' mental health, but for the environment.  Our air quality results have proven that.  Transport in Ireland remains a significant contributor to carbon emissions.  According to the 2017 figures, at 19.8%, it was the second largest emitter, behind agriculture.  <\/p> <p> There are further challenges in respect of public transport.  Covid has thrown us a curve ball which we will have to work through.  I refer to social distancing.  Our buses and trains are running at 50% capacity.  We do not know when it will be safe to increase the numbers allowed to travel on them.  Unfortunately, we are seeing the car industry trying to use that to get people back into cars.  We have seen this issue used as a marketing strategy to try to get people to turn their backs on public transport, including the bus and the train.  Preying on people's fears in this regard is absolutely abhorrent and which we must challenge with ambitious positive policy.  <\/p> <p> How do we do this?  We need to look at the cost of commuting.  Cost is still a barrier to people taking public transport, particularly those living on the outskirts of cities who have great distances to travel.  The limited competition that has been introduced in some sectors has not served to reduce prices.  Fares only increased.  We need infrastructural improvements such as proper segregated commuter cycle lanes for people travelling long distances at relatively high speeds.  There are cyclists who want to cycle in from Balbriggan, Swords, Greystones and Newbridge but it is not safe for them to do so.  Those cycle lanes need to be delivered.  We may need to look at doing something like what was done in Luxembourg, where free public transport has been implemented.  We could introduce that as a pilot scheme.  It would be ambitious but it would greatly assist people on low incomes, some of whom have to pay for kids to take Dublin Bus services to school.  Why do people take public transport?  It is not for the comfort of sitting on a bus and admiring the scenery.  It is to go to work or to school, to go shopping or to visit people, when that is allowed.  It is to contribute to both the economy and society.  Let us value that contribution and invest in it.<\/p> <p> I will return to the responsibilities of corporations and large industry.  This is an area in which I am concerned we will not make the required progress.  I voiced my concerns about the carbon emissions related to data centres.  We are on course to have more than 100 data centres in this country by 2025.  The Minister knows how much energy these centres use.  It is extraordinary.  They also have an unbelievable appetite for water, another area of resource security we need to tackle.  During the recent level 5 restrictions, data centre construction projects were considered essential while building houses to deal with the housing crisis was not.  This is an indication of the importance of these centres to the industrial strategy of the State.  Research I had commissioned shows that data centres could account for up to 29% of our overall emissions by 2030.  That is incredible and very worrying.  The corporate power purchase agreements in place mean that these companies will be siphoning off renewable energy that has not yet been created.  Who is ultimately winning in this?  We have a great deal of retrospective work to do with regard to our homes and existing industries but we are now creating new industries that emit an astronomical volume of carbon but that provide few jobs.  We are going to have to create an awful lot of renewable energy just to power these industries.  As far as we are concerned, it is bad environmental policy and we need to tackle it.<\/p> <p> Corporations are also seeking to present themselves as climate activists.  I am very suspicious of this.  They are aware that this is good marketing and that there is a good euro or dollar to be made from presenting themselves as green and environmentally friendly and aware.  We cannot be fooled.  They are ultimately motivated only by profit and share price.  Any attempt to greenwash products with self-regulated carbon labelling needs to be tackled by the State.  Carbon labelling will come.  Large conglomerates are trying to introduce it.  We cannot allow this to happen.  A few weeks ago, I introduced the National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021 on First Stage.  I ask that the Minister include its provisions as part of his climate action plan.  We need a trusted, State-led carbon labelling system that does not allow corporations to greenwash their products.  We can be leaders on this and set the standard.  We can do it, so let us.<\/p> <p> In my final few minutes, I will speak to a number of elements of the Bill that have been changed or presented.  In section 4, there is a new clause with regard to the limitation of liability.  This is a good idea.  No one should be allowed to sue the State because of climate action having reduced his or her ability to make a profit.  There is a principle involved which we are seeing in the debate on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the investor court, which is the reason we oppose the agreement.  This is a similar principle and it is welcome to see it included in the Bill.  We also have to recognise that there have been studies done in this area.<\/p> <p>I point to the study of Dr. Rachel Hilliard in NUI Galway, who has done some Irish based research on how strong environmental rules can benefit enterprises.  Basically, some firms will want a strong floor of regulation so that they cannot be undercut by firms cutting costs on the environmental side, either in their own countries or elsewhere.  Good work can be done here and it is welcome to see that included.<\/p> <p> Section 6 states that the Minister \"shall have regard to\" a long list of sources from subsection (a) through to subsection (r).  This is an understandable attempt to be comprehensive but it could unintentionally lead to people ticking boxes on a checklist or writing long reports to satisfy this clause as opposed to complying with the spirit of the law, which will be onerous on Ministers, Departments and many people.  Climate change is not easy, however.  We are so far down a bad road that to get back up will require some difficult choices and decisions.  Those decisions have to be made because it is too important.<\/p> <p> We need a further discussion on carbon leakage.  This is the system of transferring products to other countries with less restrictive regimes that we are hoping to bring in through this Bill.  It is an important concept but we have a concern that if this is not implemented or structured correctly, firms could get out of meeting their targets here through carbon leakage.<\/p> <p> We welcome the implementation of carbon budgets and we support it in principle.  It is a good idea.  The Bill states: \"The Advisory Council shall prepare and submit a proposed carbon budget programme\".  This is an onerous task so I ask the Minister whether he has plans to increase the staff numbers and resources of the advisory council so it can do this work quickly and effectively.  There is also concern about the carbon budgets and the work that needs to be done because they are five-year cycles.  Therefore, an awful lot of the heavy lifting will have to be done in the second and subsequent carbon budgets.  That is a big problem, particularly when one considers the likelihood of the lifetime of any Government exceeding five years, and we are already nearly a year into this Government.  We need to ensure that this Bill is strengthened so that the heavy lifting begins early because it will become a cumulative effect.  We have already lost so much ground and if we lose ground next year and the year after then subsequent carbon budgets will have almost impossible tasks in catching up.<\/p> <p> The Minister set a target of four months before which Ministers shall lay carbon budgets before the Oireachtas.  Why is the target four months?  Surely Ministers knew this was coming.  We have waited a number of months for this Bill to be brought to us for discussion on Second Stage but Ministers will have had a heads-up that they will need to do work on carbon budgets so why will it take four months?  Surely it could be a short time after this Bill passes through the House.<\/p> <p> We will bring forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage but that will be in the spirit of strengthening the Bill.  We acknowledge it is a good Bill that has been strengthened through pre-legislative scrutiny.  Whatever the outcome of the Bill, it is important it works as best as possible and that we all work together to reduce our carbon emissions and to help tackle climate change collectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100045#SS00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619018400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Since its foundation 40 years ago, the Green Party, alongside environmental NGOs, campaigners and climate activists, has tirelessly campaigned and advocated for an ambitious and far-reaching response to the climate crisis facing our planet.  This immense climate challenge requires an equally immense effort to combat what will be, if we do not act, an utterly devastating impact on our world as we know it.<\/p>  <p>  The Green Party entered Government with a mandate from the Irish people to tackle this challenge head-on and to implement legislation that would make Ireland a leader on the world stage in the fight against climate change.  The message was clear; we need climate action now.  This momentum and appetite for system change, not climate change, has been steadily building.  The urgency of this crisis has united millions of people across the globe.  They have marched in their droves to strike for climate, demand change and fight for their futures.  We must deliver emission reductions now for our children's futures, our planet's future and our shared future.<\/p>  <p>  Sustained climate action requires a combined commitment and co-operation across politics and society.  It cannot just be climate action.  Crucially, we must also have climate justice.  They are inextricably linked; the same side of the same coin.  We must ensure a just transition that protects the most vulnerable in our society and ensures nobody is left behind.  This will be a transition that will centre on people and their communities: where everyone can partake in a socially just society with access to housing, a strong education and stability; where we strengthen our connection with nature, build better communities and transform our society; where environmental awareness is in the mainstream and not seen as an alternative lifestyle; and where we come together to rise to this challenge with a shared purpose, while simultaneously ensuring that those who are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis are brought along with us every step of the way.<\/p>  <p>  The green movement is unique in that it is both on a global and an individual scale.  At its core, however, it is a movement of the people for the people.  The climate challenge can only be addressed if we are all working together to do so.  This requires a change in the way we govern, live and work.  We must educate our children through school, university and apprenticeships so they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to tackle this challenge head-on.  We need system change so that it is clear, obvious, safe and cheaper to make the green choice rather than the environmentally destructive one.  It is critical that we engage with people and ask how the State can best help to support them to make the green choice.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's consultation on the climate action plan does not just ask what we can do but how Government can best help everybody to work together to meet this challenge.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is a momentous Bill.  I commend my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his work on this Bill and in bringing it before the D&aacute;il.  I commend every single official, activist, expert and campaigner who contributed to make this the vital Bill it truly is.  This Bill is the culmination of years of hard work, endless campaigning and unwavering commitment by so many to protect our planet as best we can, to make it a livable and safe place for generations to come and to transform Ireland into a world leader when it comes to tackling this climate crisis.

The 99 women and men of the Citizens' Assembly were representative then of the people of Ireland but they reflect the many voices we have heard over the years.  These were voices from all corners of this island and the world, of people who have asked, demanded and persuaded us to do our level best to stop the destruction of the natural world.  In this Thirty-third D&aacute;il, we are taking up the baton.<\/p><p>As Chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action, as this Bill starts its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, I want to sincerely thank each member of our committee.  From all parties and none, from the Government and Opposition benches, we are working together to forge the best way forward and serve the people we represent.  To me, this collaborative work reflects the best of the Oireachtas.  Some 16 years ago, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is in the interests of every Deputy and party in this House to address what is increasingly regarded as the most important and daunting challenge mankind has ever faced. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is a daunting challenge.  Even though there is no effort without error or shortcoming, we accept the challenge and we get in the arena.  If we fail, we will fail while daring greatly.<\/p><p>However, if we fail in our responsibility, we will also fail to grasp our opportunity because Ireland has the potential to punch far above her weight in the global fight against this existential threat.  The greatest renewable energy resource lies off our shores.  Some 100 years on from the visionary project at Ardnacrusha, which brought light to every corner of Ireland, the west will once again be the backdrop to a project that will benefit the entire island.  The people along our Atlantic coastline, from Cork to Kerry, up through Limerick and Clare and on to Donegal, will benefit from the development and deployment of offshore wind power.<\/p> <p>The ambition and scale of this project are breathtaking.  It will help rebalance our island, and opportunity will no longer be limited to a narrow east-coast economic corridor.  <\/p> <p> With societal transformation will come unparalleled economic and employment opportunities in renewable energy, nature conservation, sustainable transport and in retrofitting our homes, schools and hospitals.  There will be a profound positive impact on people&rsquo;s quality of life because climate action policies are public health policies and are socially just policies.  Climate action will help rebalance our society as a fairer and healthier one, which treads far more lightly on our land.<\/p> <p> Climate action is often described as a race against time.  The challenge ahead may seem insurmountable, but we are living in a time when change for a better shared future is possible.  It may be difficult to imagine, but I know it is attainable.  Peter Rice, the eminent engineer, and a Louth man, was responsible for the design and construction of some of the world&rsquo;s most ambitious buildings.  He believed in crossing boundaries and imagining solutions beyond the accepted constraints.  Science and imagination when combined with an urgent purpose form a powerful compound.  <\/p> <p> The race is urgent, but every runner in a race faces forward.

I welcome the confirmation by the Labour Party spokesperson that his party will oppose CETA.  My understanding had been that that party's position on that was not clear, so this is very welcome news for those of us who will work hard in opposing that agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about climate action and a just transition, which is what we need to tackle this climate emergency.  It often suits those opposed to any attempt to tackle climate action to push the burden on to ordinary people.  This is also true of the parties in government.  Those parties of the right will try to push the burden on to ordinary working people at every available opportunity and that is possibly why, as has been referenced by other Deputies, we see only one reference to a just transition in this legislation.  That needs to be changed.  <\/p>  <p>  Hardly anybody in the State has not become more environmentally conscious and does not want to do their bit to tackle climate action.  In recent years, whether it is buying local produce, buying seasonal fruit and vegetables or recycling everything they can, people have made significant changes to their lifestyles.  Those who are lucky enough to be able to afford retrofitting or solar panels have installed them.  The main thing is that ordinary people have been doing everything that they can.  Indeed, they have been doing much more to tackle climate action than the main polluters, big business, those who fly first class around the world, or those living in our cities who drive 2020 or 2021 Range Rover jeeps 500 m down the road to go to the shops.<\/p>  <p>  If we want to properly address the climate emergency, of course we need to make serious change.  That is not lost on people, but it needs to be fair.  In my constituency people are losing their homes to coastal erosion in Donabate and Portrane.  Many of our rivers which at one time were stocked with fish are now full of plastic bottles.  People will do all they can and if the Government helps them, they will be able to do more.  <\/p>  <p>  However, do Members know how insulting it is to those who are doing all that they can when they are asked to do more especially when they cannot afford to do it?  They may buy an electric car, which is great.  On the Government's advice, I bought a diesel car a few years ago.  If people can afford to do so, they should buy electric.  However, the Government should not lecture people who cannot afford an electric car; it should help them.  It should not castigate people who cannot afford to heat their house for not retrofitting it; it should help them retrofit it.  Attacking allies and supporters of climate action will not help us overcome the climate crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We need to direct our criticisms and solutions to the right place.  For instance, we rarely hear a squeak about data centres.  They eat up as much energy as a small town and use the same volume of water.  Big business rarely gets the same treatment, which always annoys people, especially those who will be allies in this battle.  <\/p>  <p>  People know we need to improve our ways, but they are also steadfast in saying that it must be done fairly.  I ask the Government to work with us in supporting the amendments we will table to make this legislation fit for purpose to work for all people and not just the elite, the cosy few, the top 1%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100048#VV00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  On a personal note, I congratulate the Minister.  I know what it is taken for him to get the Bill to this point and I know it is a major milestone for him.  I also acknowledge the work done by the Committee on Climate Action, chaired by Deputy Leddin.  We did serious analysis and listened to the experts.  I believe the work we did has strengthened the Bill.  The discussions we had with the experts did not take place in private, as was stated earlier in the debate.  The climate committee will continue to work on this legislation and on these issues.  I invite other Deputies to attend those meetings so that when they are talking to their constituents, they can be armed with the facts and not mislead people over the impact of this Bill on communities.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at this Bill in the context of what has happened this week.  This week the World Meteorological Organization announced that 2020 was the third hottest year on record.  Next year, it is forecast that emissions will experience the second highest rise since records began.  The UN Secretary General has said we are standing on the edge of the abyss when it comes to climate change.  The question for us today is: is this Bill enough to pull us back from that edge?  Is it strong enough?  Is it ambitious enough?  I do not believe it is; I believe we can go much further as do the Social Democrats.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to dispel the myth that this revised Bill will be the most progressive in the world in implementing targets in primary legislation.  Denmark has set a target to reduce emissions by 70% by 2030 in legislation, while the UK has committed to putting in place a 78% target by 2035.  We are no longer progressive; in fact, we are behind the curve on this.  A target of net zero emissions by 2050 is simply too late, out of step with the scientific advice and far short of our fair share of the global effort needed to deliver on the Paris Agreement.  This must be the floor, not the ceiling of our ambition.  <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Andrew Jackson, Professor John Sweeney and Professor Barry McMullin recently indicated the issue of predatory delay in a letter to the Minister, suggesting that the Bill referencing the 7% annual emissions target, as transposed in section 6A(5), is legally unclear, permitting multiple conflicting interpretations, none of which is strongly supported by the text.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to clarify that issue and I hope he will introduce amendments in this regard on Committee Stage. <\/p>  <p>  Some weaknesses in the Bill give a degree of discretion to Ministers when keeping in line with carbon budgets.  There are no penalties if targets are missed or if the budgets are exceeded.  This urgently needs to be addressed before the Bill is passed.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot talk out of both sides of its mouth in addressing the issue of climate change.  The intentions in the Bill must be reflected on the ground and must be reflected in strong policy, but this does not seem to be happening when it comes to fossil fuel and gas infrastructure.  I understand the Minister plans to introduce amendments on Committee Stage on exploration.  Despite a commitment in the programme for Government to ban the importation of fracked gas and the development of LNG infrastructure, applications for LNG development continue.  We have been waiting for a policy statement for more than ten months and the Minister needs to commit today to issue that statement before new applications are in train.  It is time for the Government to reaffirm its commitment to ban the importation of fracked gas by referencing this explicitly in the Bill by way of amendment.  This was an explicit commitment made by the Green Party when it entered government, but we have yet to see any progress on that, including in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As we begin a decade in which global emissions must decrease by half if the 1.5&deg;C limit set out in the Paris Agreement is to remain viable, there is no scientific justification for the continued investment in and subsidisation of new fossil fuel infrastructure.   <\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a motherboard for overall governance and accountability measures so that we can hold the Government to account, no matter who is in power.  The Minister said that it could take five or six government terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100048#VV00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619019000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619019000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.30 p.m. and resumed at 4.50 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3 Choiste - Message from Committee","time":1619019600,"counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The Standing Business Committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has completed its consideration under Standing Order 30 of the request by the Minister for Education to waive the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny under Standing Order 173 on the general scheme and draft heads of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2021 and has agreed thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1619019600,"counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Children (Amendment) Bill 2020 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireachta \u00f3 Roghchoiste - Message from Select Committee","time":1619019600,"counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice has completed its consideration of the consideration of the Counterfeiting Bill 2020 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2021: Messages from Select Committees","time":1619019600,"counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the service of the year ending on 31 December 2021: Votes 16, 23 and 34; the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the service of the year ending on 31 December 2021: Votes 7, 8, 9 and 10; and the Select Committee on Climate Action has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the service of the year ending on 31 December 2021: Vote 29.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00800","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1619019600,"counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY00900"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619019600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Deputy Whitmore was in possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY01100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619019600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I was speaking about the issue of governance and accountability when it comes to the climate Bill.  This Bill is a motherboard for overall governance and accountability measures that we can apply to hold Government to account, regardless of who is in power.  A huge part of the committee report recommendations focused on this issue as well.  I welcome the increased accountability measures dotted throughout the Bill as a result of the Minister taking on board the suggestions of the committee.  Welcome additions include references to corrective actions where failures occur to meet emission targets, a section on climate reporting and a requirement that the Minister shall, when preparing a climate action plan, ensure that the plan is consistent with the carbon budget programme.<\/p><p>Other welcome aspects of the new Bill include the strengthened role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, by increasing its membership from 11 to 14 and a provision that future appointments to the council provide for a greater range of relevant expertise, including ecological expertise, which I was particularly keen would be included.  Do these improvements go far enough?  Will they ensure that all arms of the State work in tandem to reduce emissions and meet our national and international targets?  The reporting lag inherent in the Bill will need to be tackled.  The advisory committee has a year after the expiry of a carbon budget to propose a new one.  The Minister also has four months to consider and amend the carbon budget and to lay it before the Oireachtas.  The D&aacute;il committee may also be set up to consider the carbon budget and make recommendations within two months.  Therefore, carbon budgets will be set up based on a previous five-year period, potentially two to three years after the commencement of the relevant period.  Th<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">ere is also the issue of too much front-loading on one Department in our response to climate change, <\/font>rather than the burden being shared equally across all Departments and agencies of the State.  We tend to compartmentalise the environment, to set it aside from economic development, transport and roads when it needs to be a core component of everything we do within government and in our governance.  <\/p><p>Accountability must also be shared across all Ministers, Departments and agencies.  The Taoiseach should take a lead role in ensuring the implementation of the carbon Bill.  The Taoiseach needs to show that leadership.  We have seen throughout the Covid crisis times where the Government partners have not worked against each other and have not pulled together as one and that has impacted on community support and engagement.  We cannot afford to have something like that happening in relation to the climate crisis.<\/p><p>We need to climate proof all existing policies and legislation, including international trade deals, which brings me to the most pressing and urgent issue of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA.  How can we expect to validate this climate action Bill while at the same time the Government is seeking approval for the investor court system despite international comparative analysis revealing the threat these investor courts have on countries' ability to regulate for increased climate and environmental protections?  The environmental chapter of CETA is very weak when it comes to legal enforceability in contrast to the strong provisions to protect investors and any references to sustainability, environmental protection, and adherence to international climate agreements are only aspirational and voluntary in nature.<\/p><p>The combination of weak environmental protections, as contained in CETA, and the large pay outs resulting from existing dispute mechanisms to large energy companies, reveal that the environment has the most to lose from the new investor court system which forces national Governments to pull back on ambitious climate action policies and regulations.  We have real time and real world examples of this happening and it is not something we can ignore.  The threat of being sued under an investor court system of the type created by CETA has the potential to create a chilling effect on Governments' ability or willingness to implement policy in the interest of the public good or the environmental good.<\/p><p>I am happy to see the inclusion of a definition of biodiversity and nature-based solutions and its inclusion in the climate action plan and long-term climate objective, which I have been pushing for since I was first elected.  I also welcome that the amendments I tabled to the Nation Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2020, NORA, have been transposed and will be taken into account in this Bill.  That is a really positive move.  However, we could, and need to, go further in this regard.  There is need for clear objectives in support of the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity at the core of legislation.  Other countries, such as Costa Rica, have done this very successfully.That country has managed to provide a broad and multifaceted objective in its legislation which focuses on the integration of biodiversity into policies and the State's decision&ndash;making processes.  In Ireland, our approach to date has been to develop separate plans, separate reports and separate actions for biodiversity and for climate change.  A widening gap is emerging between biodiversity and climate action, with little communication between the two processes and we need to work hard close that gap.<\/p><p>On just transition, other Deputies mentioned that none of this will be achievable if we do not bring on board communities and those who will be most impacted by any climate actions and support them to make the changes they need to make.<\/p> <p>The climate committee made a number of very strong suggestions in regard to just transition but, unfortunately, they have not translated into the provisions of the Bill.  In fact, there is a significant get-out clause in the section on just transition, with the inclusion of the phrase \"in so far as is practicable\".  That provision needs to be strengthened.  We have seen in the media over the past two days that some politicians are scaremongering and causing confusion about the Bill among rural and other communities.  We cannot allow that to happen.  We must make sure that people understand, first, that this has to be done and these issues must be addressed but that, in doing so, we will not leave them behind and the policies and funding we put in place will focus on those who most need Government support.  That is key and it is where we need to be moving in terms of just transition.<\/p> <p> We also need to ensure we have significant consultation on policies in this area.  This is an issue I raised with the Minister previously in regard to the waste management regulations.  There was no poverty-proofing of those provisions.  There were 40 people on the stakeholder committee but nobody representing people at risk of poverty and nobody from a grassroots disability perspective.  A key consideration must be to make sure we hear those voices when we are developing policies on climate action issues.<\/p> <p> Another recommendation of the committee was to have a requirement for public consultation when preparing the long-term national climate action strategy.  Democratic participation of civil society has slowly been eroded over time, particularly in terms of the cost of judicial reviews or appeals.  Civil society organisations receive a minimal amount of funding and cannot afford to spend it dealing with costlier barriers that make it harder for them to protect and preserve the environment.  This is an issue of which we need to be very conscious.  Adequate consultation will ensure the action plans are poverty-proofed and just transition is carried out at each stage.<\/p> <p> The draft forestry Bill, in its preliminary form, threatened to curb the rights of individuals and environmental organisations to appeal decisions, as a way to address the administrative failings of the current appeals system.  This is not how we would envisage just transition.  In fact, we should be strengthening the rights of those who guard our natural environment.  We should appreciate the work they put into protecting our environment and communities.  Democracy and transparency are cornerstones of climate action, which is why the committee's recommendation to include references to the Aarhus Convention is an important one.<\/p> <p> We must ensure people on low incomes can afford to meet their minimum energy needs.  This can be achieved by ensuring people have an adequate income, benchmarked against energy costs, and controlling the cost of utilities for low-income households, via social tariffs or price caps, as we make the transition to renewable energy.  We need to expand access to free energy-efficiency upgrades, focusing on those living in social housing and private rental accommodation, and invest in public transport and rural transport, looking particularly at the potential for free public transport.  For example, rolling out things like Local Link infrastructure to facilitate local and rural communities is absolutely vital.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, the current retrofitting programme is not on course to meet the energy needs of those most vulnerable to transition.  There is a very long waiting list of people who have applied for a better energy warmer homes grant to retrofit their homes.  This disadvantages certain groups of people, including the elderly.  To date, 142,000 households have received free upgrades but there are currently 7,800 homeowners waiting for works to be done under the scheme.  There is a two-year waiting list from the time someone makes an application to when he or she gets a surveyor visit.  I spoke to the Minister about a pensioner constituent of mine in Wicklow who has very little money and had an electricity bill of nearly &euro;900 in February.  She will probably have a three-year wait to get that work done.  We need to make sure the people who want to make the changes are facilitated to do so quickly.<\/p> <p> Legislation may be drafted with all the best intentions but where Ireland consistently falls down is on implementation.  The Government continues to delay in developing the necessary legislative framework to allow for green energy to be harnessed, developed and disseminated to households and businesses across the country in line with our 70% target for renewable energy production by 2030.  Wind Energy Ireland predicts that we could miss our 2030 targets if existing barriers to planning and grid connections are not resolved quickly enough.  That is why the marine planning Bill must be introduced.  Again, we need to take into account environmental considerations.  Concerns have been expressed that we are putting the cart before the horse in this regard.  We have not yet established our marine protected areas and we have not looked ecologically to see which sections of our maritime resource should be protected before we start putting in the infrastructure.  I would like to see progress being made in that regard.  The Government needs to get to work on the renewable energy support scheme, RESS, auctions and the accompanying guidelines to facilitate these large-scale developments.  The Minister also needs to clarify the guidelines for developing community funds for wind energy, which could really benefit local communities.  In my constituency of Wicklow, there is a significant number of applications going in for offshore wind farms.  <\/p> <p> I want to raise the issue of energy-heavy industry, including data centres, which is a sector that continues to grow in Ireland.  Data centres are currently responsible for 1.5% of the country's carbon emissions but they are projected to use nearly 30% of Ireland's total energy by 2028.  EirGrid has warned that, by 2026, the twin demands of data centres and electric cars could exceed Ireland's energy supply.  It cannot be the case that the only real beneficiaries of renewable energy are corporations, with the cost being put onto the State, and onto our climate, if we cannot, as a consequence, meet our emissions and renewable energy targets.  We need assurances from Government that our move towards a different energy system will not be compromised by growing energy-heavy industries, our green energy system will serve local communities and our development needs will be met in a sustainable way.<\/p> <p> Implementation will be key to all of this and the Bill must be dealt with on an emergency basis.  Alongside implementation is the need for the necessary funding to support Departments, agencies and local authorities to implement their climate action plans.  The Government has had practice at dealing with a crisis.  The impact of Covid can be viewed as a test of the economic disruption we want to avoid as a country as we transition to a zero-carbon economy.  We can expect the hallmarks of the pandemic to be carried through a climate emergency, including the need to protect our most vulnerable, apply systemic changes in our economic system and provide proper and effective governance to implement the changes required, with funding allocated to where the needs are greatest.<\/p> <p> There is a rhythm and tempo that accompanies legislation as it passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That rhythm reflects the urgency the Government assigns to the issues at hand.  In the case of this Bill, the tempo of action is out of synch with the reality it attempts to address.  This once-in-a-generation, generation-defining legislation has not consistently been progressed with the sense of urgency that climate change and the biodiversity crisis require.  The Bill veers towards a safer, more measured rhythm, which is a result of the compromise between the opposing sections of Government.  Climate change and biodiversity loss do not care for compromise.  Such compromise is what got us here in the first place.  It is time now to pick up the pace of action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100049#YY01200","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619020200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Cathal Crowe.  The best environmentalists are not to be found behind a computer or in a lecture hall.  One will find them on the small farms in County Longford and other rural counties.  There is probably no body of people better placed to know that we need to transition towards a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally sustainable and climate-neutral economy.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that we debunk the many myths that have grown up around this Bill.  There are no plans, covert or otherwise, to reduce the national herd by 50%.  That is scaremongering and it is deeply unfair to the farming community.  There is no mention in the legislation or the programme for Government of a 50% reduction.  It simply will not happen.  It is also scaremongering to say that heavy-track machinery and diggers will have to be powered by electricity.  Similarly, it is unfair to say that we plan to tax airlines out of the sky and cripple our tourism sector.  Nor is there any intention to stop people cutting or burning their turf.  That is another myth and further scaremongering.<\/p>  <p>  Just transition and the quest for decarbonisation have been fast-tracked in the midlands.  Bord na M&oacute;na is to cease its traditional operations and that will have a devastating effect on my region.  I agree that there are crazy inconsistencies in what is proposed.  We are planning to cease the production of peat briquettes, and it seems there is an unfathomable supply issue at Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of its briquettes, while, at the same time, we are importing much inferior products from abroad.  <\/p> <p>It is crazy, too, that we still do not know when our commercial peat harvesters will be able to work this season, yet, at the same time, we are importing peat from abroad.  Commercial peat production for the horticultural sector is an important industry for counties Longford and Westmeath.  The sector made a compelling submission to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine yet it seems we are no closer to seeing if harvesting can commence this season.<\/p> <p> It is crazy too that there is a two-year wait on grant aid to retrofit a home.  There are many anomalies and issues that have to be addressed but it is also critical that those issues are not lost in the hysteria of the hour.<\/p> <p> The findings of the Citizens' Assembly have brought us to where we are and fed into the previous Government's climate action plan in 2019.  In turn, that Government committed to today's Bill and to our five-year carbon budgets and sectoral targets.  It also set out plans for an independent climate action council that will recommend carbon budgets and evaluate policy on an annual basis.  The climate action plan is open for public consultation until 18 May and will be published in the summer.<\/p> <p> It is true this climate Bill will cause farmers to focus on smart farming methods.  There needs to be supports and incentives to help them.  The key policy instrument in implementing and enabling agriculture to reach climate neutrality by 2050 is set out in the Ag Climatise roadmap launched at the end of last year.  It includes 29 specific actions that were primarily based on the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curves.  We are on a difficult journey towards a climate -neutral economy.  It will not be without challenges.  As legislators, we have an onus and responsibility on us to legislate not only for today but for tomorrow as well.  The reality is that those in Ireland in 2050 will not thank us or remember us kindly if we do not vigorously pursue this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100050#ZZ00200","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619020800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to contribute to the debate.  Some positive legislation has come before us, yet there are some concerning areas I wish to speak on as well.<\/p><p>This legislation commits to cutting carbon emissions by 51% by the year 2030 and meeting a zero carbon emissions level by 2050.  This Bill puts a statutory commitment to both of these and provides for economy-wide five-year carbon budgets.  After the legislation is passed through these Houses, the next step will be to prepare a climate action plan.  This will set out the actions required to reach the ambitious targets that are detailed in the Bill.<\/p><p>There are several areas I wish to speak on specifically and put to the Minister.  The first is aviation.  I hope that he will take a diametric position to one he held 12 or 14 months ago around the time of Government formation relating to aviation taxes.  An article featured in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>newspaper last week in which the Minister spoke about this.  At a time when airplanes are not in our skies and when aviation is at its lowest all-time ebb it is essential that everything is done to stimulate the sector to get back flying and to restore some normality.  Some say it could take between four and five years to return to 2019 aviation international flight levels.  Any talk of carbon and aviation taxes only serves to keep the industry down at ground level.  That is not where aviation belongs.  Aviation belongs in the skies above us and we need to have a diametric position as a nation when we engage with the European Commission and counterparts throughout Europe in that regard.<\/p><p>We need to see farmers as guardians of the land.  They are the current custodians.  They will pass the farms onto other generations.  They are the best allies we can have in environmental protection.  In that regard, they need to be treated properly.  A new results-based environment agri-pilot project is being devised and launched by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  It is a pilot scheme.  In future, CAP reform and farming centres need to be based around environmental measures that properly reward a farmer in the sense that they make it meaningful and reward him or her financially for going out and doing that work.<\/p><p>The Department needs to look at other measures beyond this legislation.  Irish Cement has a tyre incineration application currently at appeal licensing stage with the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is absurd that, at a time when most developed countries are moving out of incineration and large chimney stacks, this project is being considered in Limerick.  As the crow flies, it is a stone's throw from my county of Clare.  We are highly concerned about how we will be affected by the prevailing winds that will pass over the county, including over the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark.  It is not where we want to be going as a county, especially when last week we had such a progressive announcement relating to offshore wind energy.  The two do not mix.  I realise the Minister cannot interfere but I hope that he and the Department would signal that this is not the direction in which we should go.<\/p><p>Positive and progressive legislation is before us but there is one glaring omission in the environmental legislation that I hope the Department will tighten up.  It relates to GDPR and CCTV being used as a surveillance instrument for illegal dumping.  We are being told by local authorities throughout the country that they cannot use CCTV, yet weekend after weekend, trucks and trailers come up the highways and byways of our countryside and dump material.  There is some loophole that needs to be tightened.  The Minister cares about the environment.  I hope sincerely the Minister and his officials will urgently look at tightening that loophole so that CCTV can be used effectively in future to capture those who are illegally littering and fly-tipping and bring them to justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100051#AAA00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1619020800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Deputy Matt Carthy is next.

I want to start by saying something the Minister may not believe or his party may not believe.  I can honestly say that those of us in People Before Profit had hoped we would welcome the Bill and engage in the debate on the basis of support for the Bill that would begin to tackle the greatest issue of our time and the biggest threat to our people and planet.  We genuinely hoped to support it along with the school strikers, the children who stood outside the D&aacute;il on the Fridays For Future demonstrations, the activists in Extinction Rebellion, those we have been campaigning with to end the extraction of fossil fuel, fracked gas and LNG and the hundreds of thousands of people who have looked at the science and understood what we are facing.  The idea was that with this one tranche of legislation we would have some hope that at least at the highest levels of the State the process of reacting and taking the necessary steps would at last have begun.<\/p>  <p>  I wondered how it might be possible that a Government dominated by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael could deliver on such a meaningful measure.  I wondered how those in government at the highest level of the State might try every trick in the book, procedurally in the D&aacute;il, legally in the courts, media spin and spin merchants and in their unashamed prioritising of economic and business arguments to stop meaningful measures like the climate emergency Bill.  I wondered how these forces in society and government could be combatted by the Green Party.<\/p>  <p>  Since the stakes are so high we genuinely hoped that the acceleration of CO2 in the atmosphere and Covid-19 shutting down large sections of the economy might change things yet the volumes of carbon in the atmosphere were at 420 ppm and not at the 350 ppm safety level that science recommends.  This is the highest known on record.<\/p>  <p>  Like thousands of others, we had hoped, watching record temperatures broken, seeing the wildfires and droughts, understanding what has happened globally to our most vulnerable, poorest and least resilient on the planet and watching as these events get more extreme, common and devastating, that would result in this Bill setting out to start dealing with that in this country.  We hoped or understood that this could happen to the poorest people in Ireland who will suffer the most from what is coming down the tracks.  They are targeted by carbon taxes and lectured about their personal choices when they are the least responsible and least able to alter their personal behaviour.  For selfish reasons I had hoped that in ten or 15 years when we looked back at the volume of emissions and saw that this Bill did not deliver or even begin to address the core issues, there would be no sense in me or anyone else in the House saying \"I told you so\" because to be proven right on such an issue is not exactly a happy place to be.  It would be a disaster for the world and the people in it.<\/p>  <p>  We stand 100% with the climate campaigners, school strikers and the movement.  This Bill is not fit for the scale of the crisis we face.  It is not a good first step and it does not justify the participation of the Minister's party in a neoliberal Government that has turned its back on so many groups in our society in the past year.<\/p>  <p>  This failure is quantitatively different from the disaster of the Minister's previous participation in government.  It is not something that will be forgiven in ten years or forgotten by a new generation.  This is why the Green Party were given a second chance by many at the last election.  They forgot about bank bailouts, austerity measures and the betrayal of the most vulnerable.  However, there will be no fig leaf in future to justify the failure to deliver on climate change.<\/p> <p>Why will this Bill not deliver?  It will fail at every basic level because it is not adequate to deal with the task we face.  Goals of net zero or carbon neutral by 2050 are not putting us on the road to Paris.  They are not putting us on the road to anywhere.  Kevin Anderson, the climate scientist, and others have pointed out that being concerned chiefly with the targets or putting in higher targets or articulating higher ambitions is not what is required.  If one starts off aiming for a target that is not what is needed, then one's chances of success are pretty limited.  One does not get to Paris by walking west to begin with.<\/p> <p> Net zero is a con and a con that the global climate movement has already called out.  It is a con because it sets out the idea that the main task is not to actually cut fossil fuel use, but to use some form of inventive accounting to calculate sinks and other measures to balance the emissions, while also lighting a candle to the patron saint of climate and hoping that somewhere, somehow, somebody invents something that can capture and store fossil fuels that we know we will continue to use.<\/p> <p> I want to argue that the reasons given by the Minister for the failure to address the issues of liquefied natural gases, LNGs, and fracked gas in this Bill are not ones I accept.  It is not good enough to say this is only about governance and is not the place to insert bans on LNGs and yet we are still being told that on Committee Stage the Minister will deal with the issue of oil and gas exploration.  That is extraordinary and highly unusual for an issue of such importance.  If I accept him at his word, then it raises the issue that if he intends to amend the petroleum and minerals Act on Committee Stage, why does he not amend the Planning and Development Act, to insert there loudly and clearly that we will ban LNG development<\/p> <p> I raise the question Professor Sweeney and others have raised with the Minister by letter in regard to the wording around the carbon budgets and what that wording actually means and will deliver.  In theory this wording could mean that the Government will fail utterly to reduce CO2 levels between now and 2029 and yet it would still not technically be failing to comply with the provisions of this legislation.  While I think this issue is key, something that also pervades the entire Bill is a vagueness and get-out clauses are peppered throughout every section of it.  There is a deeper and more vulnerable issue, however, that goes to the heart of the problems with the Bill.<\/p> <p> When one enshrines in legislation a list of items that a Minister, a council or a Government must have regard to when formulating policy around climate change, and when many of these items are clearly contradictory and prioritise other concerns apart from climate, one is setting out one's stall to fail and is signalling well in advance one's excuses to do just that.  Aside from peppering the Bill with phrases such as \"insofar as practicable\" we also have a list of priorities to be considered first, such as the need to deliver the best possible value for money; the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long-term competitiveness of the economy; the role of behavioural changes on the part of individuals; and the special economic and social role of agriculture, particularly in respect of biogenic methane.<\/p> <p> To take the attractiveness of the State for investment, what on earth is that doing in a Bill that pretends to deal with catastrophic climate change?  Does the Minister's party or anyone in government actually believe there is not a fundamental clash between the priorities of global capitalism and stopping climate chaos?  We currently have plans to build hundreds of data centres around this country that will consume vast quantities of our renewable energy, a vast proportion of which we had hoped to use to replace the fossil fuel industry.  Does the Minister really think banning the development of data centres is a step that would not meet with serious ire from companies like Amazon or Google?  That is why these things are not included in the Bill but rather we will go on and on doing what we usually do as part of climate change.<\/p> <p> Does the Minister really that banning oil and gas exploration or the importation of LNGs will go down well with investors in Shell, BP or General Motors, or the vast industrial complex tied intimately into the fossil fuel industry?  We cannot use the State's attractiveness to investors to prioritise its competitiveness when deciding climate policy because dealing with the drivers of climate change means challenging those very priorities and challenging the drive for profits and the need for constant and wasteful production and competition.<\/p> <p> What would a climate Bill that aimed to be compliant with Paris and that saw the reality as a crisis and as something that Naomi Klein said must change everything look like?  It would amount to a green new eco-socialist deal and would herald and plan for a revolution in things like free public transport, with an ambition that would make BusConnects look like child&rsquo;s play.  Within a year we would be providing free and frequent public transport in our cities but also in rural towns and villages.<\/p> <p> It would take on the beef barons on whose behalf our agricultural policy has been framed.  Yes, that means a reduction in the herd but, more importantly, it would mean freeing our farming community from the grip of the big agribusiness that has been responsible for the slow strangulation of our farming communities and family farms.  It would mean a rebirth of rural communities based on horticulture and make farming both sustainable for our environment and for workers farmers at its heart.  It would mean setting out how we will harvest renewable energy in the interests of the people in the State and how we would do so by investing in solar and offshore energy, through a State company, delivered in a planned and rational way based on the need to cut CO2 and not on the investment decisions of private interests.<\/p> <p> There are obvious dangers when we fail in this area.  We all know what the science is saying but there is another danger.  We saw a bit of it in this House today and I want to address that.  The dangers of climate denial are not limited to Trump or the far right conspiracy theorists.  There is a deep kick-back from the industries affected and at the heart of the climate crisis that is not always outright denial but is often a policy that demands \"not here, not now, and not just yet\" or that it is not practical or cost effective and that it would damage the economy.  At a fundamental level, this Bill gives cover to that and the corollary of admitting or suggesting that we cannot tackle the huge vested interests of business and corporations that are driving climate crisis or worse suggesting that there is no contradiction between climate justice and the action of those very vested interests will breed scepticism.  It will seek to confirm to ordinary people that the big industries do not have to make any sacrifices, but that ordinary people do.  We will give people carbon taxes for using petrol or diesel but not free public transport.  We will punish people if they heat their homes with oil or coal, but we will not fund the retrofitting of people's homes.  We will bombard people with ads that demand they change their personal behaviour.  Those ads will be from the banks that have evicted people or the banks that were bailed out by the people in the past and were responsible for the economic collapse.  They will be from the big car manufacturers and oil companies whose profits are based on the climate crisis.  The danger is that that hypocrisy will be seen by ordinary people and it will make it easier for those other voices to whisper or often shout, as they did in this House today, that this is all a con and that we do not need to make any changes.  If all the Green Party has to offer is carbon taxes for ordinary people and a windfall for corporations, then we will see a resurgence of climate denial at the very moment when we need greater action and more ambition.<\/p> <p> We will be proposing amendments to the Bill.  We will be trying to change the language and will be pointing out that the targets are not sufficient and that there is a need to ban LNGs outright, and not just the licensing of future fossil fuel extraction but to deal with the current licences which run until 2035.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100051#AAA00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619021400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>What we had in the D&aacute;il this afternoon was political theatre.  This was shown most obviously and blatantly by the climate change denial group which was scaremongering about things that are not in the Bill for some cheap publicity and presumably, hopefully, for some votes down the line.  This ignores the fact that it is the small farmers who they claim to stand up for and defend who will be impacted hard by the kind of climate crisis that is coming down the road if the world does not enact a very sharp turn and change.<\/p>  <p>  We also had political theatre from the Government side and from the Green Party, in particular.  Listening to the Minister, Deputy Ryan's opening speech, one would be forgiven for thinking that this is a historic Bill and victory for the climate change movement.  The Minister said, \"It is a Bill for system change that delivers a just transition.\"  That is nonsense and the Minister knows that it is nonsense.  It is a scandalous misappropriation of the language of a movement that is being betrayed by the Green Party.  \"Follow the science\" is what that movement demands. \"System change and not climate change\" is what the people cry out.<\/p> <p>Instead, we have a Bill that blatantly closes its eyes and ears to the science to avoid any challenge to fossil capitalism.  Every step of the way, capitalist governments have refused to do what is necessary and what the science spells out.  The Paris targets, which are not being met anywhere, are themselves inadequate.  The EU targets signed off yesterday do not meet the Paris targets and they in turn will not be met.  The Government targets we have in a climate action Bill brought forward by a Government including the Green Party do not even meet those inadequate EU targets.  It is a case of one inadequate target after another, all of which will be missed if we stay on the road we are on.<\/p> <p> To start with the overall science, the target for Ireland to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is not in line with what the science demands.  The year 2050 is the absolute deadline to get to net zero or zero to give us a 66% chance of limiting climate change to 1.5&deg;C.  Ireland, as a wealthy country, should be leading.  It should be going for zero carbon emissions by 2030 rather than by 2050.  As has been pointed out, something very important is being hidden in the language of net reductions by 2030 and 2050.  It is out of step with science.  I have raised previously with the Minister that the language of carbon neutrality leaves it completely open as to how that neutrality is achieved, usually giving a nod to some vague aspiration towards carbon capture techniques and technologies which do not even exist yet.  The faith placed in the productive and research capabilities of capitalism is absolutely not warranted and the theoretical effects are completely speculative.  Reliance on carbon capture and storage is not a viable climate action strategy.<\/p> <p> Even going by the Government's promises, such as in the programme for Government, we are committed to a 7% per annum reduction between now and 2030.  However, the Bill, which is obviously lauded by the Government, does not even meet the commitments in the programme for Government.  The language used in the Bill means that all of the 51% reduction promised between now and 2030 could be backloaded onto 2029.  In the language of the scientists who have written to the Government on this issue, that would represent a predatory delay.  It is one of various scenarios the scientists set out, including putting things on the long finger, etc.  What is the consequence of that?  First, it means the cumulative reductions over the next decade will be less.  If it all happens in the last year or most of it happens in the last couple of years or the last three or four years or whatever, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere will be greater.  Second, and perhaps most important, it kicks this issue to a future government.  It kicks responsibility to a future government which could be relying on the votes or the participation of the climate deniers we currently have in this D&aacute;il.  As such, there is no guarantee a future government will follow through on the commitments.<\/p> <p> I refer to the language which appears again and again and which amounts to a get-out clause for this and future governments, namely, the language of \"insofar as practicable\".  Section 6 amends section 4 of the principal Act to state, at subsection (11), \"A Minister of the Government, shall, in so far as practicable, perform his or her functions in a manner consistent with the most recent approved climate action plan\".  Section 9 inserts a section 6B which provides at subsection (13) \"A Minister of the Government shall, in so far as practicable, perform his or her functions ...\".  The climate does not care whether everything that can be done has been done insofar as practicable, which in the political reality in this country means insofar as it does not interfere with or tread on the toes of agribusiness in particular.  There are not going to be fewer extreme weather events as a result of the Ministers doing everything they could insofar as practicable.  There will not be smaller sea level rises because the Ministers did everything insofar as practicable.  There will not be a smaller increase in global temperatures because we tried really hard insofar as practicable.  It is a get-out clause in the same vein as the references to just transition which did not manage to find their way into the original Bill.  There are a few references to just transition in the Bill before the House but every single reference to just transition or climate justice is preceded by \"having regard to\", which effectively makes it worthless.<\/p> <p> In my final minute, I wish to refer to the twin of the climate crisis, namely, the biodiversity crisis.   The fourth review of the status of birds in Ireland, a report published in the past week, should be an alarm to everybody, but to the Government in particular.  The figures are shocking.  Some 63% of Ireland's regularly occurring wild bird species are now of serious conservation concern.  There has been a 46% increase in the number of Irish birds on the endangered list in less than a decade.  In a sense, these birds are canaries in the coal mine.  They are key indicators of environmental health, and changes to their distribution and populations reflect changes in habitats, food change and wider biodiversity.  They are incredibly important to the health of ecosystems.  They are pollinators, seed dispersers and insect hunters.  We cannot survive without them.  We have to hear the warning there and recognise we need radical eco-socialist policies to break with the whole logic of fossil fuel capitalism to put an end to and avert the biodiversity and climate crises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100052#BBB00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619022000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom a bheith ag caint anseo inniu ar an Bille um Ghn&iacute;omh&uacute; ar son na hAer&aacute;ide agus um Fhorbairt &Iacute;sealcharb&oacute;in (Leas&uacute;).  I am honoured to speak as the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is introduced into the D&aacute;il.  It represents a pivotal moment for the nation, for us as politicians and for me on a personal level.  Some weeks ago, I was going through old boxes and found election literature from the first time I campaigned for a seat on Kilkenny county and borough council, in 2004.  On the back of the leaflet, I had written:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs I watch my young baby son Colm grow up so fast, I wonder what our city will be like for him in 10 or even 20 years' time.  The future I want for him is the future I want for you and your families.  You can help me shape that future. <\/blockquote>  <p>Our shared future.  Little did I know.  My eldest son is now 18 but I still wonder what our city, our county and, indeed, our world will be like for him and his three siblings ten or 20 years from now.  The difference is that standing in the D&aacute;il today as a Minister of State, having worked at the grassroots for all of my professional life, I can rest a little bit easier in the middle of all the uncertainty of this world because I know that with this Bill we are putting into law the promise that our shared future is one we will be proud for them to inherit.  This D&aacute;il has done that.<\/p><p>Some of us have been on this journey for many decades while others have joined in recent years or even months.  It does not matter.  We are here now together and we, along with all the NGOs, young activists, scientists and advocates in communities, can feel proud of bringing our country to this important point in its history.  The Bill represents the achievement of so much but we must remember it is a first step towards achieving our national climate objective.  There is still so much to do, not least within my area of responsibility, that is, nature, wildlife and biodiversity.<\/p><p>The climate crisis and the crisis in the natural world are intrinsically linked.  Climate change causes biodiversity loss through droughts, floods, fires, changes in the distribution of species and the spread of pests, diseases and invasives.  It causes ecological disruption in terms of the timing of the growing season, bud burst, fruit ripening, egg laying and hatching and migration.  Biodiversity loss also causes climate change.  Decades of wetland drainage for peat extraction and inappropriate afforestation have resulted in degraded bogs that actually emit carbon instead of storing it.<\/p><p>However, although the problems are linked, so too are the solutions.  As the Bill makes clear in its reference to biodiversity richness in the national climate objective and its regard to the protection and restoration of nature, we cannot have one without the other.  After all, nature is what regulates the climate.  Nature is a vital ally in terms of climate mitigation and balancing Ireland's carbon budget.  Degraded ecosystems emit carbon, but we are reversing that flow by growing a restoration economy that leverages public investment and the innovative financial mechanisms to generate labour-intensive rural employment in improving ecosystem health to support carbon sequestration and storage.  We are seeing unprecedented investment in the restoration and rehabilitation of raised bogs across the midlands and the economic multipliers that come with that.  This is very good news for the climate, but also for water, wildlife and communities.<\/p> <p>We are finding through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, living bog project that it is working.  The positive changes in habitat condition are happening before our very eyes, and I would be delighted to show that to all Deputies when it is safe to travel.<\/p> <p> These results are particularly encouraging as we develop the restoration economy and look ahead to other habitats in need of similar attention, such as upland blanket bogs, grasslands and coastal zones.  It goes further than that.  We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Ireland and it is important we remember nature is our first and best line of defence against a changed climate.  Healthy ecosystems are more resilient to the extreme weather events climate change is bringing, helping to protect communities, crops and infrastructure from devastating natural disasters such as flooding, landslides and droughts.  Nature-based solutions, meanwhile, with the co-benefits for biodiversity, are vitally important tools in enhancing liveability in our cities in particular.  The evidence is clear: healthy nature must be at the heart of Ireland's approach to climate adaptation.<\/p> <p> Ireland's farmers, foresters, fishers, planners and engineers will play a key role in the delivery of these objectives, and it is our job as policymakers to design systems that define, incentivise and support the outcomes we want to see.  There are challenges ahead, no doubt.  The designation of protected areas, especially in the marine environment, is an urgent priority in terms of aligning renewable policy and biodiversity objectives.  The schemes embedded in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and Ireland's strategic plan are critical tools in making agriculture a driver of biodiversity enhancement by rewarding farmers appropriately to deliver real results for nature.  The design of a new vision for forestry focuses on the notion of the right trees in the right place under the right management.  It presents a significant opportunity to create multifunctional forests that have benefits for nature on land and in our streams and lakes.<\/p> <p> Overcoming these challenges will be no small task but through cross-Department collaboration, policy alignment and integrated approaches to community engagement, we can deliver multiple benefits, both financial and non-financial, for the economy, society and the environment.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting the EU biodiversity strategy to 2030 is unequivocal in its assessment of the intrinsic link between climate and biodiversity.  It states \"protecting and restoring wetlands, peatlands and coastal ecosystems, or sustainably managing marine areas, forests, grasslands and agricultural soils, will be essential for emission reduction and climate adaptation\".  The scale of its ambition for the protection and restoration of nature across the European Union is unprecedented and will contribute significantly to the development of the post-2020 global framework for biodiversity which will be finalised at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity's conference in Kunming, China later this year.  The conference will set a trajectory for our work for the next 30 years towards 2050.<\/p> <p> I often reflect, as I cycle to Leinster House in the mornings, on the extraordinary task ahead of us, and it can sometimes feel daunting.  Little or nothing has changed for the better in the 30 years between my first day under Kilkenny's town hall as a climate campaigner and the day last year when, on a way to a council meeting, I met two young climate activists who sat at the same town hall gates every Friday.  The next 30 years simply must be vastly different.  I promised those young people that day we would do our best and I intend to keep that promise.<\/p> <p> The world is mobilising for change and, with this Bill, Ireland is placing itself at the heart of a global movement.  For my part, I will be collaborating with colleagues across Government and, indeed, across the Oireachtas to ensure Ireland seizes the opportunity to create the shared future the next generation deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100053#CCC00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619022600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>In the words of Greta Thunberg, our house is on fire.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we are less than ten years away from not being able to undo our mistakes.  The programme for Government commits to ban the registration of new fossil-fuelled cars and light commercial vehicles from 2030 onwards while phasing out diesel and petrol cars from Irish cities in the same period.  If we are serious about climate change, why is the groundwork for planning these changes not in the climate action Bill?  Those targets are less than nine years away, yet nobody is talking about the elephant in the room.  How are we going to charge electric cars when few local authorities are planning for public chargers?  We need to incentivise businesses to provide chargers in a scheme similar to the shopfront improvement scheme.  The State must do more if we are to avert this crisis.  It must do more than just buying carbon credits.  I am concerned Ireland has spent somewhere between &euro;68 million and &euro;150 million buying carbon credits recently.  I would like to know exactly how much we are spending and over what period.  Are these carbon credits ethical?<\/p>  <p>  Why are we buying carbon credits when we should be spending this money on sustainable measures that will provide a just transition for those who will struggle when further carbon taxes are introduced on 1 May?  Those carbon taxes disproportionately affect our older people and those who live in rural areas, and that needs to stop.  Fuel poverty is not acceptable in this day and age.  We need to reward those who are serious about climate change.  We should be installing solar panels on our public buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and providing proper grants for homes to do the same.  We need real steps that will make a difference, not airy-fairy aspirational stuff that means nothing.  We need simple steps that will make a real difference.  Beehives should be deemed as livestock units for the purpose of CAP payments.  Hedgerows should be improved and proper value attached to carbon sequestration properties.

Do not get me wrong, climate change must be addressed and I believe we need a new climate law to make it happen in urban and rural areas in Ireland.  I was Ireland's first Minister with responsibility for the climate and did not have the legal tools available to me to bring about the type of sustainable change that was needed.  For example, after a long and protracted battle, I secured a Cabinet decision in January 2018 not to purchase any new fossil fuel buses for public transport.  Disappointingly, the very first double-decker electric vehicle will not be on the streets of Dublin until January 2023, a full five years after I secured that commitment.<\/p>  <p>  I envy the current Minister in the way he can push things along, but in the rush to get things done, our economy, especially our rural economy, is being needlessly sacrificed when there are alternative approaches which should be taken to achieve the same goal.  While the climate Bill provides the framework for the delivery, it does not provide the mechanism to achieve it.  As presently constituted, it will decimate our economy, particularly our rural economy, and do little in return to achieve our global goal of reducing emissions because the primary focus will not change.  My big fear is the focus will remain on upfront costs, which is an incentive to do little and leave it all to the agricultural sector, with the easy option being an overall reduction in the national herd which could, ultimately, be anti-climate.<\/p>  <p>  The current system of calculating climate emissions discriminates against a food exporter such as Ireland.  Even though 90% of our beef is exported, Ireland is penalised for being the most carbon efficient beef exporter within the European Union because the rules state responsibility is on the producer, rather than the consumer.  Relatively carbon efficient beef production in Ireland can, therefore, be replaced throughout the Union with beef that is 35 times worse from an environmental perspective coming from the Amazon basin.  That is okay, according to the climate mathematicians, but not our atmosphere.  Unless we completely change the approach to calculating agricultural emissions, we will decimate the industry here in Ireland while also destroying our atmosphere for generations to come.  This is a lose-lose situation unless we look again at the maths behind the climate targets.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is anti-democratic.  If enacted, this Bill will legislate D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann out of existence on all climate-related matters.  That is undemocratic and must be opposed outright.  Section 9 states the carbon budget for the following five years is to be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for approval but Deputies have no ability to amend or alter the proposals.<\/p> <p>If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the five-year carbon budget then the Minister will, within 60 days, bring in his or her own five-year carbon budget without any need to consult with the D&aacute;il or to seek its approval.  Furthermore, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has no role or input into the individual five-year sectoral emission caps for agriculture, transport, home heating, etc.  This is akin to a law being passed to the effect that the Minister for Finance can present a full five-year taxation budget to the D&aacute;il without any detail of how he or she intends to spend the money collected.  If the D&aacute;il rejects it, the Government can bring in any taxation measure it likes within 60 days and the D&aacute;il has no say whatsoever.  On top of that, the Minister for Finance can decide how much funding is to be allocated to each Department for the following five years and Deputies have no role in considering whether it is appropriate or not.  They did not even go to that extreme in Stalinist Russia.<\/p> <p> The Bill is also anti-Irish because the climate rule book has been developed by industrialised countries, so the tools that are being used by our EU colleagues to address the climate problem are based on the bulk of emissions coming from industry, cities and intensive agriculture.  In Ireland, 37% of the population live in rural areas.  We have just two cities with a population of more than 100,000, namely, Dublin and Cork.  Whichever way one looks at it, the climate challenges in Ireland are all about land use, in particular dispersed land use.  We have extensive agricultural practices, isolated rural communities reliant on cars, a large number of small towns and the disproportionate scale of Dublin to the rest of the country.  I could go on.  Our climate challenges are the polar opposites of our European colleagues, yet the EU climate rules are designed to address EU challenges rather than Irish challenges.  This inbuilt industrialised-country bias is everywhere, from the environmental zealots who shoot down any alternative approach, right through to the Climate Change Advisory Council, which under this law will set our domestic climate targets.  The Bill seeks to enshrine into law this EU bias and Irish climate bias.  That is the reason the Bill is anti-Irish.<\/p> <p> The Bill is also against the poor.  As a result of the pandemic, families' heating bills have gone up dramatically, compounded by increased carbon taxes, but not just because people are spending more time at home.  It is because families that are struggling to pay electricity bills are subsidising the supply of electricity into data centres operated by multinational, multibillion euro companies and the level of subsidy is set to increase dramatically with our ambitious renewable energy targets.  It is immoral that people who are struggling to pay electricity bills are subsidising the cost of electricity going into data centres, many of which have been constructed on a speculative basis.  I argued vehemently against such an approach in Cabinet.  This is reflected in the Government policy statement on data centres issued in 2018.  However, this particular element of the commitment in that policy statement has yet to be implemented.  We need data centres to pay for their own costs in terms of the electricity infrastructure that is being put in place to meet their growing energy demands and in respect of the generation of green electricity.  This cost should never be put on the backs of struggling families across this country.<\/p> <p> The Bill refers to protecting \"the attractiveness of the State for investment\", which is commendable.  However, there is no mention of fuel poverty anywhere in the Bill.  In this Bill, families are forgotten.  That is not the only place where families have been forgotten.  Approximately 7,000 families that are reliant on social welfare are waiting for approval to have their homes retrofitted under the warmer homes scheme.  Disappointingly, the Minister announced that there are changes coming to the scheme \"to better target those most in need\".  In other words, quite a number of those 7,000 people, who are in energy poverty and who are reliant on social welfare, will now be excluded from the scheme due to the proposed revision.  That is wrong.  We have seen a 9% increase in residential carbon emissions during the 2020 lockdown; we have also seen a dramatic fall-off in the retrofitting of homes, which commenced in 2019 and collapsed in 2020.  In the past two and a half years we have failed to meet the targets that have been set for the deep retrofitting of homes and, sadly, if we continue to fail to achieve the targets the agriculture sector will be the one left carrying the can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100054#DDD00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619023200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I think everyone in this country and in the rest of the world agrees that climate action is a requirement.  In Ireland, there is a craving for work to be done and to be the best in class.  Where I see it going wrong is that we are tripping over ourselves to bring in a Bill to change the situation and in many cases, as we say down the country, we are putting the cart before the horse.  Agriculture is being unfairly categorised in the climate action agenda.  We are best in class for dairy production in Europe and we are fifth in class for beef production.  Why then are we saying that farmers are adding to the carbon footprint when in fact they are exemplars in what they do?  The farmer is the custodian of the land and knows it better than anybody else.  Farmers know the land is a source of food.  If we reduce herd numbers, we will also reduce beef and dairy production.  The alternative is to bring in beef from South America and one could ask what that adds to the carbon footprint.<\/p>  <p>  Another way in which we have put the cart before the horse is that we stopped the production of peat briquettes and now we are importing them.  We also stalled the production of milled peat for horticulture and now we are importing it.  We are now stopping farmers from increasing production.  What will they do then?  We have also introduced a retrofit programme for houses but when a person with a fuel allowance applies for it, he or she must wait two years for an inspection.  We talk about electric cars coming on-stream but we must look at how much it will cost people to replace their existing car with a new electric car.  The infrastructure for electric cars is still very weak.  There are charging points here and there, but there are not sufficient charging points across the country to give people the confidence they would expect in using an electric car.<\/p>  <p>  People are being told to take out their stoves and oil-fired heating systems and to put in electric-source heating systems.  The cost of making such a change ranges from &euro;15,000 to &euro;25,000 and a grant of &euro;3,500 is available.  Where are people going to get the money to do this?  A better question still is where is the Government going to get the money to do this.  We have a Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, scheme at the moment which is adding to the cost of the installation of new types of heating in houses.  The reason is that a number of contractors have been selected and approved by the SEAI, in its wisdom, and other contractors are not approved.<\/p> <p>We are, therefore, creating additional costs because the people who can do this work are limited.<\/p> <p> I heard the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, speak earlier.  She said this Bill was for the people, by the people.  If we are to deal with climate action for the people we need to make sure that every decision we make is costed so that funding is available to ensure people can justly the transition to the change we require.<\/p> <p> We have always talked about a just transition, but it seems to be a nice phrase to use.  In effect, we need to make sure that nobody is penalised through the climate action movement that we have to undertake.  We need to make sure that whatever efforts are required are put in place and are up and running before we stop something else.  It would be a crazy situation if we decided not to burn any more turf or peat in our fires if the houses which now rely on that do not have an alternative in place or cannot afford to change.  I am very concerned that we are in a zone whereby we are tripping over ourselves, and are not planning properly for what we need to do and making sure that whatever we do is of benefit to the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100055#EEE00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619023800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The Bill proposed by the Government seeks to chart Ireland's transition to climate neutrality by 2050.  It will provide for future five-yearly carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings and shape and frame the future economic and social prosperity of our country.<\/p>  <p>  Global warming is now an accepted reality.  All countries have a part to play in addressing climate change.  Some developing countries, in particular those with increasing populations, are driving significant carbon generation and will do so for years to come.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's performance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been suboptimal.  The aspirations of the proposed legislation are clearly set, but providing for them in the real world and in the context of real life activity will place a significant strain on many components and sectors of our economy and population.  <\/p>  <p>  A large part of what has been discussed in terms of an Irish climate change strategy appears to be easier to specify rather than implement.  Having 1 million electric cars by 2030 does not seem possible given the difficulties in manufacturing and the charging networks required.  There are aspirations to change our diesel and heavy goods vehicles for other forms of fuel such as natural gas or hydrogen systems which underperform in many areas.  This is also true for shipping.  Remodelling and retrofitting houses and heat generation systems are complex and costly exercises.  How can this be achieved successfully without significant grant support?  This is unclear.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the public sector adoption of climate mitigation strategies, as someone who was involved in marketing energy reducing systems for public and Government buildings, I have seen first hand how difficult adoption was to achieve without monetary resources.  This brings me to a number of problem areas and how they are to be progressed.  One is carbon sequestering versus carbon reduction.  Another is Ireland's continued intention to build data centres, which will use up much of the renewable resources we are contemplating developing.  <\/p>  <p>  How will underperformance in each of the five-year reduction plans, in particular in sectors such as energy, be compensated for in the next budget cycle?  I have concerns that the undershooting of targets in these areas will leave the agricultural sector as the one that will suffer most in trying to recoup lost ground.  I acknowledge that the national herd of cattle and sheep is a significant driver of biogenic methane.  Unlike other countries, however, the Bill does not separate targets for biogenic methane versus CO2 production in the climate change strategy.  This could mean that where agreed sectoral caps are missed, such as in energy, for example, other sectors could be targeted for further savings, such as agriculture or a reduction in the size of the national herd.  This could see Ireland cutting beef production while the European Community imports beef from Brazil, which would involve a greenhouse gas impact up to 20 times higher.  How can this make sense as a climate mitigation strategy?<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, it appears that the Oireachtas can only accept or reject the overall greenhouse gas reduction targets in each of the five-year budgetary plans.  When the D&aacute;il decides to reject an annual overall target, the Minister of the day is free to return to the House within a number of weeks and propose whatever sectoral caps he or she wishes without further approval or sanction of the House.  This presents a significant danger in terms of democracy and a democratic mandate, and in protecting the national agricultural component from the failures of other sectors to achieve stated goals.  This democratic deficit is something I would like to see amended in the final legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Although climate change is a fact and, without doubt, we need ambitious targets to achieve carbon neutrality in the future, we cannot achieve it without a feasible and just transition policy.  We cannot seek to implement national carbon reductions while eviscerating the livelihoods of significant population who live in regional and rural Ireland.  We are not the same as our European neighbours.  We have fewer densely populated areas.  We live in lower density housing and often require private transport to access work.  These are the facts of life in this country.  We need policies that reflect this reality.<\/p>  <p>  We have started an honest conversation on climate change, but we must also be honest in attributing reduction objectives to differing sectors.  We need radical management change in our public sector organisations with respect to emissions profiling and saving.  We need adequate fiscal and budgetary supports to achieve change targets by our population and industrial, public and community sectors.  Whether the national drive to address climate change is powered by hydrogen, oxygen or sunlight, reduction targets must be implemented fairly across sectors and across the national population.  This may ensure that we are all in this together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100056#FFF00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1619023800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I would like to address some of the concerns people have with it and the misinformation and false claims that are being put out there in terms of what it is about and what we intend to do.  It was claimed that the intention is to reduce the size of the national herd by more than 50%.  That is simply not true.  It was claimed that the aim is to curtail international tourism and flights into and out of Ireland.  That is simply not true.  I would like someone to point out to me where there is any mention of reducing the size of the national herd by 50% or curtailing national flights in the Bill or the programme for Government.  It is not true, and that is why people will be unable to point that out.<\/p>  <p>  It was also claimed that farmyards right around Ireland would somehow be empty after the Bill is passed.  That is not true.  Farming is, and will continue to be, an unbelievably important part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Tourism, including international tourism, will continue to be an incredibly important part of the economy and, in particular, the regional and rural economy.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address those points, speak the truth and talk about the facts.  The fact is that the Bill is not about decimating or targeting particular sectors.  The Bill is about achieving ambitious targets when it come to a reduction in emissions and reacting to the calls of the thousands upon thousands of young students who took to the streets of Ireland and called for leadership and action when it comes to climate change.  This is our way of showing that leadership.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is about missed targets.  Ireland has consistently missed its international targets in regard to climate action and emissions.  The Bill is about acknowledging the fact that climate change exists.  Some Members want to deny that fact, but it exists and we cannot stand by and watch it happen.  We have to take action.  That is what this Bill is about.<\/p>  <p>  The planet is, unfortunately, in big trouble.  We do not have to look at bush fires in Australia, melting ice caps in the Arctic or Texas freezing over this winter.  We can look closer to home, at the towns and villages that, time and again, are experiencing serious and more frequent flooding events.  We can look at the coastal locations that are experiencing coastal erosion at a far more rapid rate because of more severe weather conditions.<\/p> <p>This is happening right here before our eyes.<\/p> <p> The biodiversity crisis is not just a global issue, it is something happening right here in Ireland.  This week BirdWatch Ireland produced a report which indicated that 26% of Irish bird species are now on the red list, meaning they are critically endangered.  These are species with which every one of us is familiar, including the kestrel we all see hovering over the side of the road, and the puffin, which is used in Ireland's marketing brochures and material and our postcards.  They are critically endangered.  Today is World Curlew Day, a bird which was the sound of Irish summers in years past.  In the 1970s, there were 8,000 pairs of breeding curlew.  We are down to 135.  That is why this Bill is important, why we must take action and can no longer stand by and let others do the heavy lifting.<\/p> <p> People do have valid concerns.  We have to listen to those concerns and I agree with many of them, particularly around fuel prices, especially home heating.  I can understand those concerns, which is why we have to accelerate and bring forward our warmer homes scheme and retrofitting programmes in order that we can address that and ensure people can heat their houses and keep them warm and at a cheaper cost.  That is incredibly important, and without it, these measures will not work.<\/p> <p> There will be opportunities, which we must embrace.  These will be in employment, where there will be upskilling of tradespeople for the retrofitting programme.  There will be job opportunities in renewable energy.  When renewable technologies are rolled out in an area or there is a jobs announcement in it, I can guarantee the same Deputies who will criticise this Bill will be the same Deputies who will be the first to take to their Facebook pages and go to the newspapers to welcome the fantastic jobs announcement.<\/p> <p> This is about getting the balance right.  On the one hand, people are saying we are going too far, and on the other, there are those who say we are not going far enough.  This is an incredibly important Bill.  The simple fact is, as a nation and as people, we are thinking about the here and now and we are not thinking about the future.  We owe it to the young people living in Ireland and across the globe and to future generations to take action now.  This Bill is a first step in that.  I very much welcome it and hope Members support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100056#FFF00300","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619024400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>This Bill commits us to a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of the decade.  In my constituency of Meath West, the one project that would make the most difference to climate action is rebuilding the Navan rail line.  Irish Rail could rebuild the railway line from Dublin to Navan in three years if given the green light and funding was approved by the Minister's Department.  Currently, a review is ongoing.  We need it to be successful and for funding to be approved.  We spend &euro;2 billion a year on congestion.  The Navan rail line would cost &euro;500 million.  The population of Meath is 210,000.  Navan is the largest town in Ireland not serviced by rail.  The project has the full support of all elected representatives across all parties and all council officials are fully behind it.  The environmental argument is very strong, taking thousands of cars off the road daily, and is a must for the future success of our county.<\/p>  <p>  Wind energy is an essential part of our approach to reducing our dependency on fossil fuels.  Plans on paper are fine and well, but if we want it put them into action, we need to listen and engage with communities and respect their concerns.  Wind energy guidelines must be updated, which has not happened since 2006, taking into account set-back distances from people's homes, noise, and shadow flicker.  If turbines must be 600 to 650 ft high to get the desired wind speed because of low-lying lands, are these areas really suitable for wind farms?  We must also do more for offshore wind energy.<\/p>  <p>  Take into account turf cutting on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs over 30 ha.  There is one bog in my own area, Lisclogher, on the Meath-Westmeath border, on which 300 families have cut turf for years.  It is the only way they have of heating their homes.  They have been told they may no longer be able to cut turf on this bog.  Retrofitting houses takes time and money.  We need a phased approach to ending turf cutting on these bogs of over 30 ha.  It has been a way of life for generations and a tradition for hundreds of years.  We need to give people a chance to source other ways of heating their homes.  This was originally supposed to be phased out by 2030, but now people are being told they will be given a couple of weeks' notice.  This is not working with communities and bringing people with the Government.  It is walking on them.<\/p>  <p>  The North-South interconnector is another important piece of infrastructure.  EirGrid recently announced that the new 400 kV Kildare to Meath line will be put underground.  The argument EirGrid used for years about not undergrounding the North-South interconnector was cost.  Undergrounding the Kildare-Meath line is more cost-effective than overhead lines, so much so that the cost is no longer a key part of EirGrid's decision-making.  It is obvious EirGrid has learned from its mistakes and experiences with communities that the only way to get the Kildare-Meath line completed quickly was to underground it.  We need EirGrid to do the same with the North-South interconnector.  Recently, the Taoiseach reportedly told a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party that this will be reviewed.  We now know this will only be a review of the last review and is a whitewash as none of the stakeholders, including community groups, will have any input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100057#GGG00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1619024400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>In the Minister's own words, it is time for rural Ireland to have an input into climate action changes.  It is time the Government had representatives of rural living, which is 37%, at Cabinet.  It is time the people knew the truth about what the Minister wants to achieve, which he said on national television in October 2019, that 30 cars are adequate for 3,000 families who live in towns, villages and rural areas in Ireland, and that we can cycle and walk to collection points to collect cars.  Those are the Minister's words in 2019.  The Government is spending &euro;4.5 billion on infrastructure in Dublin.  There are people who have no choice and the Minister is spending their money from fuel taxation on infrastructure in Dublin.  There are 25 other counties which, if that &euro;4.5 billion were spent on infrastructure, it would reduce the emissions in Ireland.  It is time that people stood up in our towns and villages, and those who are from the towns and villages who moved to Dublin and other parts of the country stood up for the culture and heritage they came from.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland generates only 0.1% of global CO2 emissions according to world trading data.  Asia counts for 54% and that is increasing.  According to the EPA, agriculture in Ireland is the biggest contributor of emissions at 34%.  Methane amounts to 53% of agriculture emissions.  The Government's solution is to cut the herd by 51% by 2030, a very simple solution.  This could amount to 3.4 million cattle being extracted from the total herd.  How can any Minister think this is the right thing to do?  Is the agricultural community happy with this solution?  I think not.  The IFA president, Tim Cullinan, is looking for methane to be treated differently, as has been done in New Zealand.  The ICMSA and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers&rsquo; Association, ICSA, are very concerned about the level of reduction demanded of agriculture.<\/p> <p>I spoke to Mr. Thomas Duffy, the outgoing president of Macra na Feirme, and he told me he is calling for supports for large and small farmers to encourage them to get involved in biodigesters.  I encourage each of the farming groups and the agricultural entrepreneurs to get involved in the new consultation process, which will be open for the next eight weeks, make their point to the Minister and let the Government know how they feel about the strategy for the next ten years.<\/p> <p> The farmers should not be fooled about a case being made for methane emissions.  It is not in the Bill and it is not being treated separately, even though we have asked for this.  There are no sectoral exemptions in this Bill.  The solution is in the problem.  We should invest in renewables plants.  The agricultural community is involved in the extraction of methane from slurry pits and this can be used as a replacement for fossil fuels, producing gas for heating.  The gas is stored in a biodigester and, after processing, it is sold to the national grid.  I realise it takes time and money but farmers need to be supported in this regard and not given empty promises.  This initiative is not new and has brought in major investors from Northern Ireland, Germany and other countries.  There are several such examples of innovation around this country and they certainly should be welcomed and supported in a real and meaningful way to cut out carbon emissions.  We are setting records all right in that the Government will not be happy until Ireland is the dearest place to heat a home.  Customers are currently facing a hike of &euro;200 for a fill of oil, and the price of a bag of coal is to increase by &euro;8.  Our electricity cost is going up year on year.<\/p> <p> If this Bill is enacted, Ireland will spend billions of euro only to find out that climate change will get worse over the same period.  For instance, did the Minister know that a recent study at Oxford University has proved again that farmed fish produce more methane gas than cows?  The former Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told the farmers of Ireland to double their herd, and now the Government is advocating a 30% increase for fish farms although they have a higher methane emissions rate.<\/p> <p> Other factors that could support the reduction of emissions are supporting the suckler herd and reducing the finishing age of animals, which could be brought down.  One of the easiest solutions would be to encourage the use of sexed semen and not produce bulls.  We need supports for low emissions slurry spreading.<\/p> <p> It is not all about agriculture.  Transport in the private sector has seen little investment, which has an impact in rural areas.  We are still fighting for bus links, intercity buses and train services.  I often get the impression from urban dwellers that they believe rural people go to work by car just for fun.  A reality check is required.  There is no other way to go to work, school or college.  Why are our third level colleges' car parks full?  It is because of a lack of infrastructure.  Enterprise in rural areas needs to be encouraged so jobs will be localised, thus keeping down transport emissions.  Again, there is a lack of infrastructure.<\/p> <p> My colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I will stand up for rural Ireland and family farms with a climate action Bill.  We want food safety for ourselves and our children but we also need sustainable living for our families and farms.  We will challenge the Government and rigorously scrutinise and debate every line of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill to protect the interests of every rural family in Ireland.  The Bill is riddled with hypocrisy and doublespeak.  This Government is committed to making Ireland the first country in the world to be carbon free by 2030.  This is utter spin.  The Rural Independent Group is now asking people all over Ireland, both rural and urban, to lobby their Deputies to protect our culture, heritage and livelihoods by supporting us and amending the Bill.<\/p> <p> The people of Ireland, be they in a city, town or rural area, should note that this Bill is being produced by people who are city based and who do not understand farming or rural living.  A perfect example is what I pointed out at the very start.  It is time the Minister came to rural Ireland and moved in for a week.  It was done before with \"Livin' with Lucy\".  The Minister would have a different concept if he had to get up in the morning.  We will ask him to cycle down to collect his car and when he does, it will not be there because somebody else will have it gone.  The Minister's mentality is as it is because he knows no better.  He lives in a city in which he can walk out his front door and get a taxi and walk to a shop within two minutes of where he is.  He can get any type of transport he likes within the city in minutes, and he can cycle his bike on a cycle lane.  What is happening is happening because he does not understand rural living.  The lack of infrastructure that could be put in place represents a failure on the part of the current and previous governments.  All the people in rural Ireland could help to bring down emissions but they have to burn fuel to get to work because of the failure of the current and previous Governments to provide infrastructure in rural Ireland.  That is a reality check for the Minister and he should listen to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100057#GGG00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619025000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue.

Carbon charge increases will affect people going to work and will cost them more.  Farmers' incomes will be reduced as they will have to reduce their herds and pay more carbon tax on diesel.  Ordinary, honest people will have to pay more to heat their homes, and they are being told they cannot burn turf or timber.  They are being told they must insulate their homes and put in heat pumps and air-to-water systems that are very costly.  Where will ordinary working people get the money required?  It can be up to &euro;40,000 to do these kinds of jobs.  I am referring to poor people who are not working and people on small incomes who are struggling as it is.  Already, the waiting period for a deep retrofit, for those who qualify, is more than 18 months and can even be two years.  We should remember it is only people on the fuel allowance who will qualify for it.<\/p>  <p>  The tourism sector, which is vital to Kerry, will be financially burdened by the carbon tax changes and by the implications of the utterances of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who has said air travel charges will have to be increased.  This will prevent visitors from coming to Ireland.  Although most hauliers are now going along with the new Euro 6 diesel engine, they have to pay more carbon charges.  The Minister does not understand this.<\/p>  <p>  By 2030, farmers will have to reduce their herds by 51%.  I have heard Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies contradicting that and saying we were scaremongering.  We are not scaremongering; we are telling the truth, and that is truth about it.  Teagasc, formerly ACOT, has advised farmers for the past 40 years to increase their herds.  In 2013, the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told dairy farmers to increase their herds and that milk was the new white gold.  He told us the Chinese would drink it.  I think they do not like it at all now.  Now the Government in which Deputy Coveney is still a Minister is telling us to cut production by more than 50% by 2030.<\/p> <p>The Minister stated that farmers who do their best to cut down on carbon emissions and have hedges and ground that sequester carbon will be accounted for, but it will take seven years to measure that.  In the meantime, notwithstanding that, all the farmers who do not produce any CO2 and those who sequester more CO2 than they produce will, after the Bill is enacted, pay more in carbon tax.  Where were the discussions with the farming organisations such as the IFA, Beef Plan Movement and ICMSA?  There have been none.  While there is an advisory council and there have been meetings of the climate action committee, their memberships are all restricted.  The people who know what they are doing were not allowed in, and that is what the Government is at.<\/p> <p> Farmers have made great strides to improve their farms environmentally over recent years, complying with the nitrates directive and storing and spreading slurry safely and properly, with low emissions, vacuum tankers, trailing shoes, dribble bars and all the rest.  The Chinese and other Asians are building more coal-burning power stations to produce electricity.  Africa, India, China and other Asian countries can use ordinary, reliable diesel engines in machinery, while we have to use the Euro 6 engine.  We have to use AdBlue, which is troublesome.  The Chinese are building coal-burning stations and we are closing our turf-burning peat stations in Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p> <p> In normal times, outside of the pandemic, at any one time there are 7,000 aeroplanes in the sky.  Are they going to be operated by electric batteries?  Where will they be plugged in in the sky?  How long will it take to charge these aeroplanes?  The farmer, however, will have to get an electric tractor to spread slurry by 2027.  Where are the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who said that is not in the Bill?  It certainly is.  The Government need not try to cod the people because it will not get away with it.  There will be nothing for the good tractors that farmers have but to send them to Hammond Lane for scrap.  That is where they will end up.  After all the efforts of the Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in respect of the Bill, by how much will they reduce the global temperature?  What mathematical modules is the Government using?  It is scaremongering.  This is just another tax.  The Minister must know that the global temperature has reduced by less than 1% since 1850.  That is a fact.  If we all left this country, closed the doors and turned off all the lights, it would reduce global emissions by only 0.13%, and that is a fact.<\/p> <p> There are new rules for the Order of Business, but since the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is the one involved in the Bill, I ask him where the funding is for the local improvement schemes for rural Ireland and Kerry.  Where is the funding to install a proper water supply to operate in mid-Kerry, around Beaufort?  It breaks down every day and people have no water.  That is essential but the Government is not considering those issues.  The Government, headed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, has done enough harm.  It closed Bord na M&oacute;na - no more moss peat, no briquettes.  While it is true we can import them, that costs money and carbon is emitted in doing so.  Does the Government realise that?  Is it awake or what is wrong with it?  We are leaving 10,000 acres of bog behind us in Littleton, County Tipperary.  We did not have gold or diamonds to start with and we do not have oil.  If we did, we would not be allowed to use it.<\/p> <p> I return to the suggestion that the Minister of the day will be able to bring forward a carbon budget, whether the House supports it or not.  That is undemocratic.  There is much talk about Putin at present, but he is nowhere near as bad as this - not a hope in the world.  He would not be at the races with the gang we have here.  What a stunt, whereby the Minister thinks he can push through a budget without giving the House any say.  Will he stand up and tell us that is democratic?  It is not, and he will not get away with it.<\/p> <p> If the Minister, Deputy Ryan, does get away with it for the time being, he will not do so when he next goes to the doors.  It is undemocratic, and the men and women of 1916, 1921 and 1922 fought for democracy in this country, and he is trying to shut it down.  He will probably try it, given the new voting arrangements and the way that the coalition parties are tied together at the hip.  Fianna F&aacute;il, just to stay in power, is backing the Bill and the Minister.  Perhaps they will get away with it for the time being, but each and every member of the Government will regret it and get it back on the doors because that is what they deserve for trying to blackguard the people, the ordinary good honest people who are trying hard to survive.  The Government is trying to drive them down to the ground but it will not get away with it, and I hope it does not.  The Minister might get away with it temporarily but he will have to face the people, and that is democracy.  He will get his answer for sure, and I promise him that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100058#HHH00500","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619025600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Costello.

I recognise that every Deputy has a mandate and is entitled to be listened to with respect, but we have to understand that the Bill did not come out of thin air.

They were entitled to participate in the work of the joint committee, and the committee facilitated Deputies and Senators inputting into that process, even if they were not members of the committee, in recognition of the importance of this issue to all parts of Ireland, urban and rural.  Deputies have come to the Chamber and said they are fighting for rural Ireland, and that they are the sole voice of rural Ireland.  When the hard work was being done by the joint committee to bring the legislation forward, where were those Deputies?  It is easy to be in the Chamber today when the cameras are on, when Deputies know they will get a snippet on \"Six One\" or a nice little video for Twitter and Facebook, but when the difficult work is being done, the boring, long hours going through the legislation section by section, that is when the real changes happen.<\/p> <p>That is when those Deputies who are so irate today could have had an input, but they did not choose to.  In the context of the important issues we are debating, it is important that be put on the record.<\/p> <p> As the Minister with responsibility for children, I will briefly speak about our intergenerational obligation to pass this important legislation.  My colleagues have spoken about our shared future but the future belongs to the next generation.  That generation has led the way and brought us to where we are today, debating this important legislation.  Their actions and activism over the past five years and the fact that they demanded that Deputies of all parties and Independent Deputies act on climate change in the last general election and the last European election have created the momentum that brought us here today to speak on this important legislation and to prepare the process to adopt it.  This legislation copper-fastens in law the actions that we, as a society and as a country, need to take to secure their future.  That is ultimately why we are here today.  It is about securing the future of the next generation, of those who cannot vote today and of those who are not even born today but who, in 2050 when the real impact of climate change is felt, will be adults and starting to earn their livelihoods. <\/p> <p> I regret that I have had to take a negative tone in my comments today.  There is so much good and so much positive to speak about in this legislation but it was important to set the record straight on certain issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100059#JJJ00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619026200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The urgency of climate change cannot be understated with any seriousness or reasonableness.

There is a worryingly unfair distribution of public transport, cycle lanes and greenways between the south side and the north side.  We need a commitment from the Minister to support Cork City Council in ensuring fairness and in ensuring that public transport, greenways and cycle lanes are provided for the people of Cork North-Central.  They need alternatives to petrol and diesel cars and this cannot happen without further investment.  The proposed light rail service for Cork city includes no north side-south side link.  How can we look for people to get out of their cars if we do not provide the infrastructure for them?  The recent announcement of 66 sustainable transport projects in Cork again shows inequality in that 31 of these projects are on the south side and only 12 are on the north side.  Some &euro;15.77 million is to be spent on the south side while only &euro;5.8 million is to be spent on the north side.  How is this equality?  This shows the disparity that exists.  If we want to provide truly sustainable and environmentally friendly transport for people, the system must be integrated.<\/p>  <p>  There have been deep retrofits in Allen Square and Brother Rice Avenue and surrounding areas in my constituency over the past 12 months.  These works were finished last week.  People have said that their heating costs have been halved and that their houses are warmer.  It has made a great difference.  There is no more dampness or cold in the houses.  However, they had to fight for years to get this done.  They had to campaign.  Areas from Mary Aikenhead Place across Cork city are crying out for such retrofitting.  I listened to Fine Gael Deputies talking about a just transition.  Where is the just transition for those people who live in houses that are freezing cold and damp and which have draughts and mould in the walls and who have been waiting years for retrofitting?  It needs to be done now.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great deal I want to say on this matter but I have limited time.  In a recent finding, the European Court of Human Rights said that Ireland is in breach of Article 16 of the European directive on local authority housing and that local authority tenants are living in substandard accommodation.  In addition, the Economic and Social Research Institute says that there is a clear link between fuel poverty and poor health.  <\/p>  <p>  Climate justice cannot happen without social justice.

In saying that, the revised Bill is a great disappointment.  To assess it, one must ask two core questions.  First, if the legislation is implemented in full and all the targets in it are achieved, will Ireland have done all it can to ensure that human activities do not cause global average temperatures to increase by more than 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels?  Second, does the legislation show a clear commitment to climate justice so that those individuals, corporations and societies that have contributed most to the problem of global warming contribute most to its solution?  With regard to this Bill, the answer to both questions is \"No\".  That is what has to be improved upon.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a positive improvement on the legislation proposed last October, which was full of loopholes and vague language.  At least it is now tighter from that point of view but some areas remain to be tackled.  The justification for the Green Party entering the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government was that it would have an impact on climate change but the Bill now before the D&aacute;il falls way short of what is actually required.  The biggest problem with the Bill, although not the only one, is the weakness of its definition of \"climate justice\".  Put simply, climate justice means that those individuals, corporations and states that contribute most to climate change must contribute most to its solution.  Some of the world's poorest people, who are affected by drought, flooding and the loss of land to desert not at some time in the future, but today, have contributed hardly anything to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty calculated that the top 10% of emitters worldwide contributed approximately 45% of global emissions annually while the bottom 50% contributed approximately 13%.  Accordingly, the first principle of climate justice is that the richest individuals and societies, those that contribute most to global warming, must pay to protect poorer individuals and societies from its negative effects and must also play the biggest part in halting and reversing those effects.<\/p> <p>Climate justice must also apply to carbon taxes.  Carbon tax is one of the most commonly proposed means of lowering emissions but it is controversial because it can be regressive, meaning that those with less wealth and income end up paying a greater proportion of their income and wealth than those with more.  This is the situation we are at with Ireland's current tax regime, which involves a simple tax on fuel, oil, natural gas, kerosene, marked gas oil, liquid petroleum gas and solid fuels.  The Bill should include progressivity in carbon taxes as a guiding principle of climate action.  There is a need for all carbon taxes to be progressive, that is the proportion of an individual's income or wealth paid in tax to increase with increasing income and wealth and for the revenue from such taxes to be solely spent on measures to further climate justice, including a just transition.<br\/><br\/>The question of a just transition for those who could lose their jobs, such as those in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB is a major weakness in the Bill.  There must be strong income supports and retraining, alongside investment in sustainable green energy in the areas most affected.  A just transition is best achieved through the solidarity economy, meaning through initiatives controlled and owned by local communities.  For example, a body of research shows that a community is much more supportive of renewable energy production if it has a stake in it.  The Western Development Commission has shown that community-owned energy initiatives have greater economic multiplier effects than externally-owned projects.<br\/><br\/>Climate justice demands that the Bill sets much more ambitious goals.  The global target for net greenhouse gas emissions is that they reach net zero by 2050.  However, the living standards of the poorest people, who are least responsible for climate change, need to rise to acceptable levels.  That means the poorest countries should be allowed to increase their emissions for some time after the richest nations.  They should not be expected to reach net zero emissions until after 2050.  To achieve the global goal, countries such as Ireland need to reach net zero emissions long before 2050 and we have to be looking at 2040 or 2045 at a maximum.  That has to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  In particular, section 35C of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 on just transition should be inserted in the Bill.  I will propose that when we come to amendments.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this month, the High Court found that the Government as a whole was not obliged, in the exercise of its executive power, to have regard to a national mitigation plan, nor to the furthering of a national transition objective under the 2015 Act.  The Government must seek to fix this loophole by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.  It must close the loophole identified by the High Court in the Friends of the Irish Environment <i>v<\/i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la (Shannon LNG) case.  This Government has committed to giving statutory effect to ending the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of gas.  The Minister indicated that this commitment would be provided for in legislation on Committee Stage of the Bill.  However, this will not impose a ban on LNG infrastructure being developed in Ireland to facilitate imports of fracked gas.  The programme for Government includes an explicit commitment to bringing forward a policy to end imports of fracked gas and LNG.  The Minister should address this gap in the Bill and publish a comprehensive plan to ban the importation of fracked gas, and specifically to ban LNG terminals in Ireland this year, which should be included in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Experts in climate law and science have identified a weakness in the drafting of the new section 6A(5), which sets a binding target for 2030 to guide the setting of the first two carbon budgets by the Climate Change Advisory Council.  There is some uncertainty over how the 51% emission reduction target, as set out in the Bill, is to be calculated.  I am not a climate scientist so I will leave it to the scientists to make those points.  The Minister has a copy of that letter from those scientists and he should respond to it.<br\/><br\/>The Joint Committee on Climate Action recommended that the Bill should fully account for emissions from aviation, shipping, non-territorial or consumption-based emissions, and offshore mitigation strategies.  All of these areas need to be explicitly addressed in the Bill, alongside targets to prevent the offshoring of Ireland's climate obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100060#KKK00400","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619026800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Tomorrow, April 22, is Earth Day.  The first Earth Day took place in 1970.  Now, the Earth Day website states that more than 1 billion people have mobilised for &ldquo;the future of the planet&rdquo; and that there are more than 75,000 partners working &ldquo;to drive positive action&rdquo;.  In 1970, 20 million individuals are said to have mobilised on the first Earth Day.  That is 51 years ago.  One would expect there to have been major change in the interim given the level of awareness back in 1970 on the need to protect our planet.  Yet, here we still are burning, destroying and decimating our natural resources and our life source.  All of this is done in the name of capitalism, greed and the patriarchy.<\/p><p>In the summer of 2018, the world sat up and took notice of a young Swedish activist who began the hugely popular School Strike for Climate.  From the strike came the Fridays For Future movement, which, pre-Covid, was a mass movement of over 100,000 schoolchildren going on strikes in more than 100 countries around the world.  Greta Thunberg and her peers around the world put climate action firmly back on the political agenda.  I say &quot;back&quot; on the political agenda because climate action has been on international agendas for some time.  There have been countless global conferences and historic agreements, endless reports, climate change denial and realisation that developing countries are suffering the impacts most, while having contributed the least to climate change.<\/p><p>Part of the disconnect from the urgency of climate change is how the problems are portrayed.  We are not speaking in layperson's terms.  We speak about tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>or CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalent, emissions trading schemes, ETS and greenhouse gases, GHGs, including CO<sub>2<\/sub>, methane and N<sub>2<\/sub>O.  Scientists, academics and researchers are, thankfully, educating us about the percentages of carbon emission reductions, sinks, biomethane emissions from livestock, gases and targets.  One of the great things about the previous D&aacute;il, as Sinead Mercier reminded us in her interview in the <i>Business Post<\/i>at the weekend, was that every political party was assigned a climate researcher so that every political party and Member in the D&aacute;il could understand what was being talked about with these issues.<\/p><p>We all remember the 1980s and 1990s when we were worried about the hole in the ozone layer.  Scientists had discovered that chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, were causing this hole.  People were told that aerosols contained CFCs and there was a concerted effort across industry, manufacturers and consumers to eliminate and drastically reduce, or both, the use of CFCs in aerosols and other products that up to then had been emitting them at large rates.<\/p><p>In recent years, climate action has seemed like an upper- and middle-class issue.  Those who could afford to buy electric cars bought them.  They also retrofitted their homes and shopped organic and from ethically sourced suppliers.  There is no fast fashion for those who can afford otherwise.  There has been a kind of snobbery around the individual responsibility for addressing climate action.  The reality is that some aspects of climate action are not accessible for cohorts in our society and people are doing their best within the systems that have been created around them.  We need to look at that and that is why a just transition is so important.  Why talk so consistently about personal responsibility but then allow Google to move $75 billion in profits through the supposedly defunct double Irish loophole?  That does not make any sense and people see that.<\/p><p>The Bill before us is a vast improvement on what was initially introduced.  I commend the members of the Joint Committee on Climate Action on the thorough pre-legislative scrutiny they undertook.  It is welcome to see that many of the committee&rsquo;s 78 recommendations were accepted.  There are some remaining issues with the Bill, which I hope will be addressed on Committee Stage because it is imperative that we have tangible and clear targets in place.  The Government must be held to account for missed targets.  We cannot continue to pay lip service to the most pressing issues of our time.  I would also like to commend the activists and grassroots organisers who have been working tirelessly to scrutinise the Bill and offer solutions to all Members.<\/p><p>In 2018, we made history in this House by passing the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018.  The Act amended the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 and instructed the agency to divest the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund of its assets in fossil fuel companies.  This divestment is to take place within five years of the commencement of the Act to precipitate a timely decarbonisation process in line with Ireland's climate change commitments under Article 2 of the Paris Agreement.  It was a great day and we were lauded internationally for our work.  We know that Ireland is so small that we do not make a huge difference globally but we can and should be a leader in the fight against climate change.<\/p> <p>That Act made a difference globally and it sent out a message across the world that it is possible to divest and that everybody can do it.  If a state sets out to do it, it can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100061#LLL00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619027400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1619027400,"counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100062#MMM00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Secretaries General","time":1619027400,"counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100062#MMM00500"},{"type":"question","time":1619027400,"counter":426,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[20796\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100062#MMM00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of international applicants to the Top Level Appointments Committee for the recently vacant position of Secretary General of the Department of Health; and the number of international applicants who were shortlisted for the position.

This is in parallel with other reforms to the budgetary process on well-being, gender and inequality, which are intended to improve the outcomes in these areas.<br\/><br\/>My Department has developed and published a methodology for identifying expenditure that is having a positive impact on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  Identifying the quantum of Government spending dedicated to addressing climate change is a necessary first step in assessing the effectiveness of this expenditure against climate and environmental goals.  Ireland chairs the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting and the specific green budgeting reforms that I will implement will be guided by the emerging international best practice from this and other groups.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not provided on the floor of the House.<\/i><br\/><br\/>On the review of the national development plan, my Department published the phase 1 report of the review on 4 April.  As noted in this report, Departments are required to assess every spending proposal against a range of environmental outcomes.  The aim of this is to ensure that our public investment priorities are aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s climate and environmental objectives.  It is important to note that all projects included in the plan will be subject to the detailed rigour of the public spending code, which is updated regularly to reflect lessons learned and international good practice.  The phase 1 report also sets out the ongoing body of work under way in my Department to strengthen the environmental and climate factors underpinning the code.  In particular, I anticipate altering the shadow cost of carbon that applies to all projects once the higher targets envisaged in the draft climate action Bill are adopted.  This will ensure that the amount of emissions a project may give rise to is quantified, and a value placed on those emissions that reflects the cost that society will have to bear to eliminate these emissions in the future.  I aim to finalise and publish the new national development plan by July 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100062#MMM01500","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619028000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

As a first step in the climate and environmental review of the national development plan, Departments are required to perform a qualitative assessment of every measure they are putting forward for inclusion in the revised plan against each of seven climate and environmental criteria, including climate mitigation, climate adaptation, water quality, air quality, waste and circular economy, nature and biodiversity and just transition.  The cumulative score of each measure across all outcomes will be used to assign a traffic light style rating to the measure.  This assessment aims to give Government a high-level view of the compatability of all measures being considered for inclusion in the national development plan with broader Government climate and environmental policy.

Comparing the construction costs of a project with the total payments made by the Exchequer over a 25-year PPP contract does not compare like with like.  The Deputy will be familiar with many of the major infrastructure projects in Ireland that have been developed using the PPP model.  I believe it is an option that we should retain on the list of delivery mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100065#PPP00700","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1619029200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I read that in the phase 1 report of the NDP.

We have seen the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General stating they are vulnerable to legal challenges and that this can cause significant delay.  We know that costly legal fees are then picked up by the taxpayer.  The Parliamentary Budget Office observation was that PPPs represent a growing State liability.  I take the point the Minister is making but will he commit that there will be increased monitoring of their performance as part of the NDP?  As we know, legal challenges represent a cost issue.

This commitment is also reflected in the approach towards the review of the national development plan, NDP.  My Department recently published the Phase 1 Report - Review of the National Development Plan following a detailed process of engagement.  This report, which outlines the various strands of the review process, provides an evidence base to inform capital investment decisions to support economic, social, environmental and cultural development throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Another recent element of the reform process relates to the commitment to develop a set of well-being indices.

This framework will create a well-rounded view of how Irish society is faring.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is intended that the framework will be utilised in a systematic way across Government policymaking in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress as a complement to existing economic measurement tools.

There are very significant responsibilities attached to this role including the ongoing management of the response to the Covid-19 public health emergency, implementing the Government&rsquo;s ambition for the roll-out of Sl&aacute;intecare and the management of the greatly increased budget of &euro;22 billion for health in 2021.

However, the capability challenges vary by sector and entity and they need to be better understood and addressed on this basis. <\/p>  <p>  The report proposes several solutions to the various challenges but recognises that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution and the need for supports and initiatives must be tailored to the entity, sector and industry challenges.  The report also recommends that when assessing the maturity of programme capability, a focus should be placed upon the sectors and sector programmes which do not currently have a singular asset delivery specialist but are forecasting increased activity and scale through their mandate under the NDP.

In my previous role in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, when I responded on behalf of the previous Minister with responsibility for the OPW I had recourse to answer questions asked by Deputy Moynihan so I am familiar with the case.  The main sources of flooding along the River Sullane arise when the capacity of the river channel itself is exceeded, along with the three tributaries to the north of the village.  The flood risk is also impacted from the storm network that can independently cause flooding through the gullies and overland flow.<\/p>  <p>  As the Ballymakeera study area has the potential for a large number of flood relief options, it is essential that the environmental screening of each option is considered carefully, having regard to sensitive environmental constraints in the area.

We have a record envelope of &euro;10.8 billion this year and are keen to proceed with and set out an ambitious capital development plan for our country out to 2030 to make sure it is properly aligned with the priorities in the programme for Government of housing, transport, health and, of course, climate action.  The national development plan is, in essence, a sister document to the national planning framework and both make up the overall Project Ireland 2040 overarching strategy for our country.<\/p>  <p>  I dealt with the new PEACE PLUS programme earlier which, as the Deputy knows, is being developed by the special EU programmes body, a North-South implementation body.  It will have a &euro;1 billion fund over the next number of years for a range of cross-Border initiatives.  I am in dialogue with the Minister, Mr. Conor Murphy MLA, of the Northern Executive to try to get the maximum benefit for Northern Ireland and south of the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100070#UUU00800","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1619032200,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response.  We are operating a national development plan from the point of view of changed times, wants and needs, along with the issues we have consistently had in respect of housing.  We are talking about dealing with climate change.  There are retrofit schemes which are not necessarily fit for  purpose at this point in time.  I know just under &euro;1 million was given to Louth County Council to deliver 36 houses, which is not what we need.<\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister deal with the specifics of a plan post pandemic and the national development plan relationship to delivering a stimulus?   Once we have secured people's personal safety, we need to then secure businesses and provide a stimulus to ensure we do not follow the austerity path that led to deprivation for many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100070#UUU00900","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1619032200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I want to commend the Minister on the energy has brought to the review of the national development plan, but I wish to raise a number of matters.  In the context of the increased budget, what proposals does the Minister have to reform the delivery mechanism for those projects?  There is nothing more frustrating than a budget being allocated and the project then not being delivered owing to a lack of capacity.<\/p>  <p>  I know the national planning framework is an aligned document and a different administrative responsibility.  I refer to the ministerial responsibility for the public service, the whole notion of accountability within the national planning framework in the various positions and accountability to the public and elected representatives.  Does the Government have any thoughts on that?<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the N26 road and the western rail corridor.

The revision of the national development plan will take account of the pandemic, our learnings from it and the impact it is likely to have on the development of Ireland in the years ahead.  In addition to reviewing the national development plan, we are also preparing a new national economic recovery plan.  The intention would be to publish that document in early summer.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of economic supports, as Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; knows we have given a commitment that supports will not end abruptly at the end of June.  I would anticipate that in the next short number of weeks we will finalise our intentions with regard to vital schemes such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support scheme and others.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Calleary's point, I wish to highlight again the reforms that are being introduced to the external assurance to strengthen our capability to deliver.  He touched on a vital point, namely, the ability to deliver on the national development plan.  It is one of the great challenges we face.  Money is not always the real constraint; rather, it is the capacity to deliver.  We are determined to make improvements in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042100070#UUU01100","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619032200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619032200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 8.30 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 22 April 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
