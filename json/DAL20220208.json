For more than a year, households have been hammered by a cost-of-living crisis that is out of control.  Workers and families do all they can to keep up with sky-high bills and runaway price increases, but people still cannot catch a break or catch a breath.  They are crucified by the extortionate costs of housing, energy, fuel, groceries and insurance and everything going up and nothing coming down.  Last night, a Minister of State offered people advice on dealing with this cost-of-living crisis.  His big idea was for people to stop complaining and to shop around.  Those were callous and indifferent remarks from a Minister of State who is paid &euro;140,000.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has form in blocking legislation that would force big insurance companies to stop fleecing their customers.  His words reflect the attitude of a Government that is utterly out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people.<\/p><p>Many households are deciding whether it is best to pay their massive gas bills or to put food on their tables.  It took the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government a year to wake up to this crisis.  For months, we have asked that VAT be removed from energy bills, but the Government did nothing.  No work was done with the European Commission.  There was no effort at all.  The Government has now spent another four months talking about possible actions.  Indeed, in the time it has taken the Government to give people a one-off payment of &euro;100, it has managed to give one top civil servant two pay hikes worth &euro;6,000.  There was no dithering or delay there; it was done with the snap of your fingers.  When it comes to workers and families, however, the response from the Government is slack.  There is no urgency and no determination to get the job done.<\/p><p>Many things can be done to tackle this cost-of-living crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed these measures: cutting rents, banning rent increases, cutting childcare costs and expanding eligibility for the fuel allowance payment.  We have also called on the Government to scrap its planned carbon tax hike.  This hike will increase gas bills and push home heating oil costs up substantially at a time when people are struggling.<\/p> <p>Carbon tax hikes add to the cost of everything, particularly food, due to increased transport costs.  Farmers have been telling the Government this for a long time but it has not listened.  Is ualach trom &eacute; an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im costais mhaireacht&aacute;la.  T&aacute; daoine faoi bhr&uacute; ollmh&oacute;r ag &iacute;oc bill&iacute; fuinnimh m&oacute;ra.

The Government's &euro;100 credit is far too little for far too many families.  March is very far away for people who cannot afford their energy bills today.  That payment must be increased and delivered quickly.  I call on the Taoiseach to scrap the carbon tax hike and set out how he will support struggling families in a meaningful way.  Workers and families now need a bailout.  We need a package of measures for those on low and middle incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800003#A00500","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644329100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very important issue.  Since this Government came into office in the midst of a global pandemic, a one-in-100-year event, the Government has intervened to an extraordinary degree to underpin incomes and support lower income workers, to keep people in jobs and to support enterprises.  That has been an effective and successful intervention in underpinning our economic activity.  There is no question about that.  We supported workers from the get-go of the formation of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  This time last year, a barrel of oil on the international markets traded at $61; today it is at $91 a barrel.  That was not caused by carbon tax.  It is a global phenomenon.  Let us not try to misrepresent the issue for the public out there who are watching.  The cost of a litre of petrol has risen by 28% over the same period.  Gas prices on international markets have nearly quadrupled over the past year.  The average annual gas bill has risen by &euro;700.  The vast majority of that has very little to do with carbon tax.  That has to be said.<\/p>  <p>  On proposals to reduce VAT, we have been over this before.  I know the Czech Republic example has been cited by the Deputy in the past.  Before the Czech general election, which was just before Christmas, the Czech Government reduced it to zero.  There is a new Government in the Czech Republic now and it has gone back up to its standard rate of 21%.  Ireland already has a derogation on our VAT rate.  If we were to do a temporary reduction, we would lose the derogation and could end up back at 23%, a much higher cost of VAT, which we do not want to do, obviously.  We want to keep it at the current rate of 13.5%.  That has all been explained.<\/p>  <p>  The United Kingdom and the US are looking at multi-decade highs in terms of inflation.  The euro area inflation rate is now at 5.1%, an all-time high.  The US rate is even higher again.  We understand that people are under significant pressure arising out of this inflationary cycle.  As a result of that, in the budget we allocated well over &euro;1 billion to a number of measures to increase disposable income for the people, both in terms of tax income relief of about &euro;525 million and also significant proposals around social protection in terms of the fuel allowance.  For example, since coming into office the Government has raised fuel allowance from &euro;630 to &euro;914.  Coupled with the &euro;113.50 electricity payment, Government supports for those on low incomes have increased by 63% to &euro;1,027.  We are going to do more on that front.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge for us is that we cannot chase inflation.  From a macroeconomic point of view, that has been tried in previous decades and it did not work.  We have got to cushion the blow of this inflationary cycle for those most in hardship and those most at risk.  We have got to target the measures the Government is currently examining to do just that.  That is what we intend to do and to alleviate people more generally in terms of these pressures.<\/p> <p>The Government has a number of measures under consideration to help people over and above what we have done already in terms of the budget.  That will be the basis for our actions later this week.  Aonta&iacute;m go bhfuil br&uacute; faoi leith ar dhaoine faoi l&aacute;thair.  N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi sin.

I take it from the Taoiseach that that is not the official advice from the Government.  The Government should stop dithering and should intervene in a way that is proportionate to the real struggles facing people.  At the time of the budget, the Government fell short on social welfare adult payments and in terms of the fuel allowance, the season itself and extending eligibility for it.  The Government has fallen short for months while Sinn F&eacute;in has called on it for a discretionary fund and to package and tailor initiatives, particularly for low- and middle-income families.

We have tabled a range of comprehensive proposals on energy taxes, VAT, social welfare and wages.  Bills are up more than 30% for fuel, electricity and gas.  Prices for other utilities and food are rising sharply.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach knows that the rate of home ownership has fallen significantly among young people.  More and more are stuck renting at unaffordable prices.  For years, we have been calling for a rent freeze.  Those calls have been ignored.  For those young people who are trying to save for a deposit, their dreams are getting more and more out of reach as their everyday bills rise.  Good GDP figures and strong tax returns mean very little if this country is not working for them.<\/p>  <p>  The poverty of imagination on the part of the Government is baffling.  So far, the only tangible practical proposal from the Government has been a tokenistic &euro;113 off the payment for electricity bills.  Of course that may be increased - we do not know yet - but it is a drop in the ocean compared to the rising costs that people face.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday's great idea from a Minister of State in the Department of Finance was that people should stop complaining and shop around.<\/p> <p>Changing your electricity or gas supplier will not help when prices have soared by so much.  It is too late to shop around when you hit the checkout and do not have enough money to pay the cashier.<\/p> <p> The big news from the Government today is a new retrofit scheme.  From what we know about the scheme, it is likely to be unaffordable to many.  From the Minister of State's remarks yesterday, it is clear the Government is already well and truly insulated from the reality of life for so many families.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has ruled out a mini-budget, which tells me his plans will simply not go far enough.  Without a commitment to a finance or social welfare Bill, we get just a small number of tweaks, changes and token measures here and there that will not cut it.  For those on low and fixed incomes, the only action that will really help is an increase in wages.  Ireland has a problem with low pay; Ireland needs a pay rise.  We need to understand why working people are struggling to get by to pay for the basics.  Over 20% of Irish workers are low paid.  We spend billions every year subsidising low pay to lift people out of wage poverty.  It is absolutely bizarre that, two weeks ago, the Taoiseach set his face against wage rises.  Wage rises for low- and middle-income workers do not have the inflationary impact he thinks, yet he has advised workers not to seek inflation-beating pay rises.  We do not see any direction from him to companies to hold back on price rises.  Therefore, profits can be protected but not wages.  Is that the case?  If so, it is not on.  Will the Taoiseach heed SIPTU's calls for pay rises?  Will the Government lead on this by asking the Low Pay Commission to convert the minimum wage to a living wage?  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether he is completely ruling out the prospect of a mini-budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800005#C01300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644330000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>It is only a number of weeks since we lifted restrictions.  We are emerging from a pandemic that has dominated this country and the rest of the globe in respect of economics, public health and so forth.  The intervention by the Government was imaginative, unprecedented and effective in terms of underpinning jobs and incomes to the best degree possible given the extraordinary situation we faced.  That cannot be wished away and forgotten about as if it did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the global situation, because the world is opening up there has been an imbalance between supply and demand, as the Deputy well knows.  The bounceback of the economies has created supply chain issues, which is adding to inflation.  We have the exponential increase in oil and gas prices, which is a factor, and issues with transportation.  All of these combined are giving us what some economists in the European Central Bank have called a pandemic cycle of inflation.  It remains to be seen how long it will continue for.  There are different schools of thought on that.<\/p>  <p>  What I am saying to the Deputy is that wages have increased in the private sector.  We have never said that wages cannot increase.  The good news so far is that those wages have increased in line with productivity gains within that sector and certain other sectors of the economy.  It is good, fine and important that this happens, but we should be aware of what we must not do.  Most stakeholders agree with this.  In this regard, we had a very good, constructive meeting last week with the social partners in the context of the Labour Employer Economic Forum.  We need to navigate our way through this intelligently, the priority being to protect those who are hardest hit by this inflationary cycle.  Having regard to people's weekly bills, we need to take measures that can help to cushion the blow of this inflation.  That is the Government's agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Nash may call the electricity payment a gimmick.  It is a &euro;200 million provision.  Two hundred million euro, on any day, is not a gimmick; it is a serious, substantive allocation, but we have to do more, particularly to help people in need and to have measures to target people in need.  Also needed are measures that over the medium term will be sustainable in some instances and in line with medium-term Government policy.  That is the approach we are taking to this.<\/p>  <p>  During inflationary cycles in the past, there were many policies that people felt would be impactful against inflation in the short term, but they turned out not to be.  We do not want to fall into repeating mistakes, particularly those of the 1970s.<\/p> <p>It is a long time ago.  It is when we last had a really serious issue in terms of inflationary spiral.  <br\/><br\/>We are going to continue to focus on the minimum wage.

There is a commitment in the programme for Government to move to a living wage.  I ask the Taoiseach to change the legislation governing the Low Pay Commission to instruct the commission to move towards a roadmap for the introduction of a living wage in this country.  We have an epidemic of low pay in Ireland.  That is the reason those who are merely existing on low and middle incomes are finding it so difficult to absorb the additional costs they are burdened with at the moment.  They cannot survive.  We have a low pay epidemic.  One third of all Irish workers earn less than what might be considered the living wage of &euro;12.90 per hour.  I ask the Taoiseach to listen back to what David McWilliams said to Pat Kenny on Newstalk this morning.  He could not have been clearer.  He said the only solution for low-paid workers is to have wage increases.  A high-wage economy is a good thing.  It adds value, boosts retention and makes people much more secure.

We will work with the social partners in respect of this current inflationary cycle and in terms of national agreements and so forth.  However, critically, in the next number of days, Government will take measures that will help to alleviate the impact of the current inflationary cycle on people, particularly those on low incomes who are feeling the brunt of the rise in the cost of fuel.  As I outlined earlier, internationally, the price of oil and gas has risen exponentially.  We need to cushion that blow.

The country is now contending with the cost-of-living crisis on multiple fronts.  It is causing widescale financial pain for every citizen.  It is due in no small part to the Government's climate action policies.  The carbon tax is the key contributing factor, with the cost of motor fuels up more than 22.6% and the cost of home heating oil up a staggering 70% in the last year alone, not to mention road diesel and agricultural diesel.  For example, soaring petrol and diesel prices have been caused in large part by the Government's disjointed climate action policies, which are taxing consumers and leaning heavily on them.  They are disproportionately affecting people in rural Ireland, but everybody in the country as well.  The people in rural Ireland have very limited access to public transport or alternative fuel sources.  Through the Government's taxation on fuel, a motorist is now paying approximately &euro;1.70 per litre for petrol, of which a staggering &euro;1, or 60%, goes directly into the Government coffers.  That is mainly due to excise duty, VAT and carbon tax.  The Government-imposed carbon tax, which is now at &euro;41 per tonne of carbon after last October's budget, is clearly having a bruising impact on the cost of home heating oil, electricity, petrol and diesel.  It is now the leading cause of inflation in Ireland.  Why has the Government completely ignored the toolbox of measures developed by the European Commission, which encourages member states to cut taxes and levies on motor fuels, home heating oil and electricity bills?<\/p> <p>The Spanish Government, for example, has used this policy and brought energy prices back to 2018 levels.  This is being done by cutting taxes and capping costs.  Other EU states such as Sweden have also implemented tax cutting measures.<\/p> <p> The energy crisis brings major repercussions for every household, small business and farmer.  It is financially crippling.  Everyone talking about it in this House knows that.  It requires meaningful and tangible State intervention.  Even the unelected EU bureaucrats recognise that and have recommended that this Government and other member states take action.  Why has the Taoiseach completely ignored the European Commission?  Normally when the Commission says, \"Jump\", the Taoiseach asks, \"How high?\"  If it told him to up taxes, they would be increased the day after, but in this case he is just ignoring the Commission.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in government have totally ignored this.  High energy prices have deeply profound economic consequences and, therefore, an immediate and meaningful State intervention is required, not the paltry &euro;100 off electricity bills.  The Taoiseach needs to act immediately on the European Commission's DIY toolkit aimed at mitigating the impact of higher energy prices by slashing taxes and offering help to impacted households, motorists, the agriculture sector and all other sectors in the economy.  It is needed to reverse the decision to increase the carbon tax in budget 2022 and beyond until further impact and cost-benefit analyses are carried out.  The Taoiseach needs to stop talking about it and immediately take those actions.  Talk is cheap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800007#E00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644330600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Again, I have to restate what I said earlier.

That is just one product.  That can be mirrored in product after product since economies have reopened after Covid-19.  That, along with the oil and gas price increases, is fuelling this inflationary cycle.  It is a challenge.  That is why some economists, such as the ECB, are saying it is short term but others disagree.  There are two schools of thought as to how long this cycle will last, but the hope is that the imbalance at the moment between supply and demand will correct itself over time and help to reduce inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, we have some very significant key objectives of Government.  Those are housing - to get supply up in housing and build as many houses as we can; to get a strong climate change agenda once and for all and not keep putting it on the long finger and avoiding action; and also dealing with health reforms and using what we learned in the pandemic to embed reforms in the health service for the long term.

It is a damning indictment of what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people, whether they are living in Israel, the occupied territories, on the Gaza Strip or in East Jerusalem.<\/p>  <p>  It is a 278-page report with seven chapters, an executive summary and conclusions and recommendations.  I have read almost every single word.  I speak from knowledge of having read the report.  The evidence and the research set out is based on over four years of research.  It is gathered together and it is built on the work of B&rsquo;Tselem and the previous reports from Human Rights Watch: A Threshold Crossed.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence and the research is clearly set out.  It is a balanced and moderate report.  It finds that Israel&rsquo;s system of institutionalised segregation and discrimination against Palestinians as a racial group in all areas under its control amounts to a system of apartheid and a serious violation of Israel&rsquo;s human rights obligations.  <\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Taoiseach has not had time to read this report because I am sure that it is not possible with his busy schedule given it took me hours to do so.  I am sure, however, that the conclusions and the recommendations have been drawn to his attention.  Does he agree with the conclusion that an apartheid system is in operation?  Will he raise it at EU and UN level?  Does he agree that the International Criminal Court should consider the crime of apartheid in its current investigation in respect of the occupied territories, Israel and what it has done?  Will he commit to ceasing the purchase or acquisition of Defence Forces equipment from Israel as called for in this report?<\/p> <p>Will the Government use its seat on the UN Security Council, first, to highlight the recommendations of the report and, second, to ensure they are implemented, including imposing targeted sanctions such as asset freezes against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid and a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel?<\/p> <p> I will conclude by saying that I do not want to hear about antisemitism and how we must be careful.  We will take that as a given.  I am over time, so I will stop with that.  I ask the Taoiseach to use his three minutes appropriately and not with regard to antisemitism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800009#G00900","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644331800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as an cheist phr&aacute;inneach agus t&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute;.

It is depressing that this litany of measures continues each year.  I believe it was 2009 when I visited Gaza after one terrible conflict.  Not much has changed in terms of segregation and the routes Palestinians have to take in the occupied territories as opposed to others.  What is happening in East Jerusalem is not satisfactory by any yardstick.  It is injustice after injustice.  There is a better way of doing this.  We have appealed to the Israeli Government to work towards a two-state solution.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was in Israel between 1 and 5 November and he set out our continued support for the two-state solution.<\/p>  <p>  We have raised this at the UN Security Council.  Indeed, the Secretary-General of the UN last year thanked me for Ireland's constructive contribution on this issue at the Security Council and for raising it consistently.  We want to get a settlement and a resolution of these issues.  The settlements and the demolitions are unacceptable, as is the way people are treated.  In addition, civil society must be respected and supported.  Ireland has supported various civil society organisations that raise human rights and we believe Israel should facilitate their unfettered access to people.  They should also be allowed to continue their work in an uninhibited way on human rights within Palestine.<\/p>  <p>  Is that report the Amnesty International report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800010#H00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1644331800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800010#H00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1644331800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>That is currently being examined by the Department of Foreign Affairs.

The Government, however, proposes to ram through the committee report on carbon budgets with no opportunity whatsoever to debate it here in the House.  The truth for that is because what is contained within the committee report is a cop-out.  The programme for Government promised 7% annual reductions, but contained in the report is a recommendation for a 4.8% reduction for the time of this Government.  Even extending out to the end of the decade, Professor Barry McMullin has pointed out that it amounts to an average 6% average reduction.  It breaks the programme for Government, it breaks the Paris climate agreement, it breaks EU emissions targets and, most important, it breaks the actual science in terms of what needs to be done.  It relies on unproven and non-existent carbon capture and storage technologies in the future, and it ignores the impact of aviation and shipping emissions.

It examined eight loyalist paramilitary attacks in south Belfast between 1990 and 1998, which resulted in 11 murders and one attempted murder.  The report has found strong evidence of investigative and intelligence failures, collusive behaviours by the RUC, including the continued unjustified use of informants involved in serious criminality and murder, and the return of weapons to loyalist paramilitaries.  The report is, quite simply, appalling.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I met with a number of victims and survivors groups from across the community in Northern Ireland.  I met with Mark Sykes, who is a survivor of the Sean Graham bookmakers massacre attack.  I was very grateful to him for taking the time to talk to me on the 30th anniversary of that shooting.  It was very emotional for Mr. Sykes, and it was as was clear to him 30 years on as it was on the day it happened.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have an issue with the House debating these issues in a structured way.

This Cabinet committee oversees the implementation of the ambitious programme for Government commitments in relation to the environment and climate change.  The key climate change commitments are now reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which sets out challenging carbon reduction targets for 2030 and the added statutory commitment of achieving a climate-neutral economy by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its remit under that legislation, the Climate Change Advisory Council has proposed three five-year carbon budgets for the period until 2035.  The carbon budgets are the overall, economy-wide emissions ceiling that we must work within if we are to achieve our reduction targets for 2030 and beyond.  The proposals by the advisory council have been considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which yesterday published its recommendations.  Over the coming weeks, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, having considered these recommendations and the original proposal by the advisory council, will bring a proposal to the Government on determining these budgets.  When the budgets are agreed, the Government will then proceed to setting sectoral emission ceilings.  These will determine the upper limits of emissions for each sector, which when added together must keep within the overall carbon budget.<\/p>  <p>  Agreed policies and measures designed to ensure that sectors quickly and significantly reduce their emissions have been set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021, which was published by the Government before Christmas.  The plan will be further revised this year to ensure the actions it contains are sufficient to meet the reduction targets that will have been made explicit through the setting of the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.<\/p>  <p>  Climate change is a profound challenge for this planet and Ireland must play its full part in addressing it.  Just as the threats of climate change will touch each of us, the journey towards carbon neutrality on which we have now embarked will require all of our efforts.  We have much to gain.  We in government will take the lead and provide support where we can.  Ministers will now be answerable for their performance on emissions reductions and ensuring that the sectors for which they are responsible play their part in cutting greenhouse gases.  However, this is a shared journey.  It will challenge us all to rethink how we work, how we live, how we heat our homes and buildings, how we grow our food and manage our land, and how we travel.  Opportunities abound if we have the confidence to grasp them.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change will continue to meet regularly throughout 2022 to progress all these aspects of the Government's ambitious climate action and environmental policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800018#R02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1644335700,"counter":231,"content":"<p>There are many questioners present, but they will each have just one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800018#R02600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1644335700,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Last week, the T&aacute;naiste expressed his frustration with the Government's slow rate of progress in accelerating plans and ambitions for renewable electricity and new fuels such as green hydrogen.

As the Taoiseach knows well, farming is the backbone of our rural communities.  We need to protect it, intervene and provide supports.  From the sustainability perspective, one of the key measures is protected urea, but that is also increasing in cost because of the energy crisis.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on measures to protect that sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800020#T00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1644336900,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Amid concerns over sustained inflationary pressures, and as the midlands struggle to adapt to a new era with the fast-tracked carbonisation and the closure of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB operations in those areas, I ask the Taoiseach if he has a view on giving some consideration to a further decentralisation of Government Departments and agencies in Dublin, and bringing them out to areas that have been most adversely affected and have paid the biggest price in the understandable move towards decarbonisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800020#T00500","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1644336900,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Workers have returned, and are returning, to offices across the country, with many now working on a hybrid basis.

In response to Deputy Smith's question on MetroLink, as far as I am concerned, we need to get it going.  It will happen.  It could be subject to delays.  If there are planning delays or judicial reviews, that will delay it, but some of those issues are beyond our control and people are entitled to exercise their rights, and so on.  However, we should be under no illusion that one of the biggest challenges for infrastructural projects in this country is progressing through all the various stages and so forth.  The Government has made a decision to proceed with this and we will proceed with it.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy McDonald's question on pensions, again, the Oireachtas committee evaluated and gave its response to the report of the Commission on Pensions.  We have asked the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to review the recommendations because there are recommendations in relation to PRSI and potential increases in PRSI to deal with a range of measures to improve pay-related sick pay and pensions as well.  We will ask the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to give its views on that.  The Government stated that six months after the publication of the report of the Commission on Pensions we would return with our views on it.  There are no easy answers here.  We should stop pretending that there are easy answers.  The adult generation in this country needs to make sure that there is a sustainable pension system for younger generations.  From what I am hearing in the House, I do not get the sense that there is really buy-in to that.  I think there is a strong tendency in the Opposition to kick this down the road and to oppose any measures that would give pension sustainability, but that is the way politics works I suppose.<\/p> <p>We are committed to fulfilling that and getting meaningful recommendations too.<\/p> <p> As regards the points raised by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, I fully take on board the additional costs in relation to fertiliser and ration and other issues pertaining to farming.  It is challenging; there is no question about that.  Again, however, we hope through other measures and other income streams we can provide that we could try to offset that.  I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is engaging with the stakeholders in farming to address some of these issues but they are not easy.  The Deputy mentioned fertiliser.  I mentioned cars earlier.  The increased cost of fertiliser results from the global supply chain issue and part of the gas costs issue.

Almost everybody working in Carlow was from that wider region.  Instead of having to commute to Dublin, they were able to work in that unit in Carlow and it made absolute sense on a whole range of issues.<\/p> <p> The point raised by Deputy Devlin is very imaginative.  We are looking at a number of imaginative ideas around transport.  Public transport has to be the way of the future also.  We have to increase participation on public transport and cost is a key aspect of that.  <\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I would simply say that I do not understand why D&uacute;n Laoghaire had zero, or very few, social housing completions last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800020#T01100","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644337500,"counter":280,"content":"<p>The council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800021#U00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1644337500,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The council, yes.

In the intervening period, circumstances pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic have meant that it has not been possible, until now, to arrange for the establishment and running of further assemblies.  The recent easing of public health restrictions means it is once again possible to plan for the running of assemblies with in-person meetings.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm to the House that the Government has today agreed to the establishment of two citizens' assemblies, one dealing with the issues of biodiversity and the other dealing with the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  It is proposed on this occasion to run the two separate assemblies concurrently, with inaugural meetings planned for April 2022.  This will be the first time that two assemblies will run concurrently, and presents a significant opportunity to design and implement an operational model that can allow for a greater number of citizens' assemblies to be run.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that a citizens' assembly on drug use will follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with a citizens' assembly on the future of education.  That decision, of course, will be taken later this year and will be informed by what we learn over the coming period about the benefits and challenges of running assemblies concurrently.<\/p>  <p>  The matters to be considered by both assemblies are important and urgent, and the Government wishes to move with speed to get the assemblies up and running.  The formal establishment of the new assemblies will require a resolution to be passed both in this House and in the Seanad.  The Office of the Government Chief Whip will be engaging with the Business Committee this week to make the necessary arrangements to bring a motion before the Oireachtas next week.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference for each assembly have been designed so that they are sufficiently well-defined to ensure a clear focus for the assembly, while at the same time not being so prescriptive as to inhibit the scope of the assembly to define its work programme as it deems appropriate.  The terms of reference for the Citizens' Assembly on biodiversity derive from, and are consistent with, the resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in May 2019 which declared a climate and biodiversity emergency and called for a citizens' assembly to examine how the State can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the Dublin Citizens' Assembly derive from, and are consistent with, the programme for Government, which contains a commitment to establish a citizens' assembly to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  The full terms of reference will be included in the motion that is to be brought before this House next week.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Government wishes to move with speed to establish both these assemblies and we look forward to further progressing this matter this week and next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800021#U02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1644337500,"counter":308,"content":"<p>There are several speakers and the time is limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800021#U03000","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1644337500,"counter":309,"content":"<p>First, I welcome the establishment of the Citizens' Assemblies on the directly elected mayor for Dublin and biodiversity.

Last Thursday night, I pleaded in this Chamber with the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs to prioritise the citizens' assembly on drugs because lives are at stake.  The difficulty is that, unfortunately, Irish society does not value the lives that are at stake.  When the announcement came today about the Citizens' Assemblies on biodiversity and a potentially directly elected lord mayor of Dublin, there was a level of devastation within the communities and families that are deeply affected by the issue of drugs.  I ask the Taoiseach to please give us some level of hope of a timeline for the citizens' assembly on drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800021#U03300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1644337500,"counter":312,"content":"<p>With the announcement of the Citizens' Assembly on biodiversity, this is an incredibly positive day for the efforts of this country to tackle biodiversity loss and the protection of wildlife.

This support is echoed across the country and, it would also seem to be the case on some local authorities, by Government party councillors, given the motions that have recently been put forward.  I am not going to lie or sugar-coat this when I say that I am appalled and deeply saddened that circumstances have progressed in such a manner that the motion is necessary.  I am also deeply disappointed at the proposed Government amendment to the motion.<\/p> <p>I am also somewhat perplexed by the Government quoting sentences from our motion.<\/p> <p> Five months ago, listeners were rendered speechless by the \"Documentary on One\" by Katie Hannon, entitled \"Women of Honour\".  Even those of us who had been in contact with the women in the run-up to the documentary and had a small idea of what was to come were, like others, deeply disturbed at the range and depth of the issues raised.  Those harrowing experiences recounted in public by the women of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and discrimination made for very uncomfortable and worrying listening.  These female former members of the Defence Forces displayed bravery and fortitude in coming forward into such a public domain to speak about their experiences.  Given the Government's proposed amendment, those are characteristics the women will continue to have to call on as the Government effectively gaslights them.  The revelation of what those women endured made it clear that Ireland, like many other countries, was experiencing its own #MilitaryMeToo movement and that it would not be left unscathed.<\/p> <p> In the aftermath of the revelations, there were meetings between Ministers and officials and the group, and assurances were given in public and in private that the Women of Honour would have input into the terms of reference.  In a statement in September regarding the establishment of an inquiry into allegations, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, confirmed this would happen.  However, in February 2022, there appears to have been not only a change of heart but a change of priorities.  The only request, which was for a statutory inquiry, has been ignored.  Instead, an internal review is the only show in town.  The Minister and his officials are trying to convince both the Women of Honour and the rest of us that it is perfectly reasonable and not insulting at all to dilute the only request of the key stakeholders, a request made so that nobody else would go through the experiences they went through.  How are these women, who chose to serve the State and were repeatedly let down by the structures and successive governments, expected to have faith in a review where nobody is compelled to engage or attend and which will rely entirely on the goodwill of potential conversations?<\/p> <p> It is small wonder the Women of Honour left the last meeting with the Minister for Defence.  I presume he is still at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, since he is not here to deal with a defence matter.  The women said to me, as they said in a public statement, that they effectively felt like they had been patted on the head.  That was their take from it.  The core message from the Women of Honour is that they want to ensure no other member of the Defence Forces endures what they endured.  They know, just as the Minister knows, that nothing will change as a result of this review.  The Minister must re-engage with the key stakeholders, the Women of Honour group, and create fit-for-purpose terms of reference that provide for adequate scope to deal with the issues in a statutory inquiry, not a review.  It may be late, but there is still an opportunity for the Minister for Defence to do the right thing for this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800022#V01400","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644338700,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Minister is doing a grave dishonour to the Women of Honour by refusing to grant the commission of investigation they want and deserve.  In recounting their appalling experiences at the hands of men, among them senior officers wearing the uniform of the State, they are taking on not just their alleged abusers but the entire apparatus of the Defence Forces and the State, and by God we know how the institutions in this State like to protect themselves.  We know the lengths the State will go to in order to defend the indefensible, and do so lavishly and with great effort with the people&rsquo;s money.  It is not lost on people that when anybody has to challenge the State and its agencies, it is the people's taxes that pay for the legal and institutional war the State wages against the person.

Her rapist was fined three days' pay.  The female soldier was labelled a troublemaker, a slut and worse.  She was badly let down by the system that was meant to protect her.  She attempted suicide a number of times and became an alcoholic.  There is the story of a female sailor who was drugged and raped, which resulted in pregnancy.  She miscarried.  She told her doctor what had happened and he told her it was her word against that of the rapist.  The officer who raped her was a serial rapist who was known for trying to get into female bunks while at sea.  He was eventually forced to retire with a senior petty officer's pension and a gratuity.  There is the story of the rape of two female soldiers by four soldiers while on a tour of duty in Lebanon.  These soldiers had a reputation for depraved behaviour.  The two female soldiers had their drinks spiked.  They were then stripped and anally raped.  The rapists then dressed them again and put them back to bed.  There are many allegations that resulted in cover-ups, forced moves, closing ranks and the quiet retirement of perpetrators.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear the current internal system for dealing with complaints is not fit for purpose and fails to protect those who lodge complaints and those tasked with carrying out investigations.

Of course, as we know from other institutions, even with that structure, predators can feel they have major opportunity.

We all believed the Minister, in fairness, when he met the Women of Honour and said this would be a priority and he would do what was required to show things would be different.

On his behalf I welcome the opportunity to respond to Sinn F&eacute;in on this important matter, and I thank the Members opposite for their contributions over the past 20 minutes.<\/p><p>I confirm, without question, that the Government commends the Women of Honour, a group of former Defence Forces members, on their bravery, courage and commitment in telling their experiences in the public arena to bring about change.  I had the privilege of meeting the Women of Honour group on 29 October last, when I had the opportunity to hear first hand their personal experiences and their wish for change for serving members and future members of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>There are policies, systems and procedures currently in place for dealing with allegations and complaints of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace, but it is clear from strong views expressed at the meetings both I and my colleague have had with stakeholders, including serving members, that the pervading culture in the Defence Forces, and those policies, systems and procedures have not served and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel well.<\/p> <p>We share a common position on the issues being raised.  I agree completely with the reference in the motion that violence, abuse, coercion and harassment of any individual in any society is totally unacceptable.  The abuse of power is not acceptable in any form.  This is why the development of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, led by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is so important in tackling this epidemic.  As the Minister has said, \"it is vital that we step up our policy response right across Departments and agencies to ensure that the third strategy is the most ambitious yet\".<\/p> <p> The Government acknowledges that the experiences shared by the Women of Honour group in relation to physical abuse, harassment, coercion, sexual assault and assault as highlighted are shocking, very serious and utterly unacceptable.  We have both a legal obligation and a moral obligation to ensure those who serve the State and offer protection to others at home and abroad are themselves protected.  It is for this reason the independent review that has been approved by Cabinet is now operational and is proceeding without delay as a critical and necessary next step in addressing these serious issues.  Members of the Defence Forces expect nothing less.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has an immediate obligation to serving members to ensure the workplace is safe and that there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour in the Defence Forces.  In this, the Minister has the full support of Government.<\/p> <p> I am aware there was extensive engagement with a range of stakeholders over previous months, including serving members, the representative associations, the Women of Honour group and a further group of the original Women of Honour group - the men and women of honour group - on the terms of reference, which were approved by Government on 25 January last.  I understand the Secretary General and senior officials at the Department of Defence met the Women of Honour group on seven occasions, and on three of those occasions the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was also in attendance.  As I have already mentioned, I also met with the group on 29 October last.  In addition, meetings have also been held with the men and women of honour group.<\/p> <p> On foot of these engagements with stakeholders, I am aware a number of observations have been incorporated into the terms, including the bringing of the Department of Defence within the scope of the review's body of work, which is a particular ask of the Women of Honour group.  The review group will also be engaging with the various structures within the complaints process, including the independent Office of the Ombudsman of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> While the independent review has the support of stakeholders, including serving members of the Defence Forces, I am aware the Women of Honour group has expressed the disappointment of its members with the review and is seeking the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.  I am aware the Taoiseach met with members of the Women of Honour group on Monday, 31 January.  He listened very carefully to their views and advised them that he concurred with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the need to take action now to address the need for a safe work environment for serving members founded on zero tolerance for unacceptable behaviour.  The Taoiseach also met with members of the men and women of honour group on Friday, 4 February.  They relayed their harrowing experiences to him and stated they supported the independent review and would co-operate with it.  I express my appreciation to the members of this group for also having the courage to share their experiences with the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> These are complex issues with different views from stakeholders as to how best to address them.  Both the Minister and the Taoiseach have underlined that the Government is not ruling out a further body of work in the future to examine allegations of a historical nature, and I wish to echo that message this evening.  The terms of reference for the review provide that Government may consider further work on receipt of the independent review findings.  The review group, comprising three members, is chaired by Bronagh O'Hanlon, a recently retired High Court judge.  The other members of the group are senior counsel Mark Connaughton and HR specialist Jane Williams.  Their work has commenced and they have been specifically asked to advise whether further work is required to examine issues of an historical nature and to make any recommendations in this regard.  As the Minister has indicated previously, an interim report is expected within six months and a final report within 12 months, which will be brought to Government.<\/p> <p> I again commend those in the Women of Honour group on their courage in sharing their experiences and I emphasise in no uncertain terms that their concerns are not being ignored.  The Government is fully cognisant of the trauma that can be suffered by victims and the need to consider carefully the most appropriate course of action.  On foot of initial engagements with serving members of the Defence Forces and the Women of Honour group last September, the Minister announced last October, interim support measures for members of the Defence Forces impacted by unacceptable behaviour in the workplace.<\/p> <p> A confidential contact person, who has been appointed within Raiseaconcern, is available to assist serving and former members of the Defence Forces, and this provides a safe place to support the reporting of alleged wrongdoing in the workplace.  The service is up and running since the announcement and has received and is receiving calls.  Given the nature of the allegations, the Minister acted quickly in putting in place an appropriate confidential contact person who is independent and outside the chain of command, and whose role is to listen to the caller, assist in documenting his or her allegations, and provide guidance on follow-on options.<\/p> <p> The Inspire confidential helpline, which is available on a 24-7 basis for all serving members of the Defence Forces, has also been made available to anyone who has contacted the confidential contact person.  In addition, the personnel support service in the Defence Forces assists members and their immediate family with the provision of information and advice on areas, including stress management, counselling and referral options.<\/p> <p> Whether recent or historical, however, the Minister and the Government have been consistent in the message that those who may have suffered serious wrong of a criminal nature are urged to report their concerns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate such matters.  I strongly support this position.  I commend this countermotion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800024#X00500","speaker":"1475","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644339900,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1644339900,"counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800025#Y00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1644339900,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Michael Healy-Rae - to discuss assessments for, testing and treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland;

He gave assurances that the women impacted would have an input into the terms of the review.  He said he would bring about real change.  This never happened.  Instead, the Minster, backed up by the Taoiseach, decided, with no input from the Women of Honour, that this would be an internal review only and not a statutory inquiry, for which the women affected had asked.

They have shown courage and they have a great deal of pride in their own service and their roles in the Defence Forces.  They feel very badly let down.  They still feel an obligation to their colleagues in the Defence Forces to make things better and to change things.<\/p> <p>It is now the Minister's turn to take a stand against abuse and harassment, stand up for that honour and protect all current and future members of the Defence Forces and Naval Service.

Unfortunately, what has come from his Department has fallen far short of this commitment or the great lengths to which the women concerned went in their pursuit of truth and justice.<\/p>  <p>  When survivors of abuse, in whatever form or circumstances, go to great lengths and at great personal cost to tell their stories and to seek justice, it is incumbent on all of us to ensure every mechanism of the State is made available to address these issues and to ensure they do not happen again.  Just as we have seen with the survivors of the mother and baby homes, the Government seems to listen to anybody else apart from those immediately affected.  Just like those survivors, the women of honour and others who have had similar experiences continue to live with the consequences of the injustices imposed on them.  <\/p>  <p>  What we have learned through these revelations is deeply disturbing as it concerns some of the gravest allegations that can be made.  An internal review will not deliver real change because we need to know the extent to which these problems prevail within the Defence Forces.  There is a legal and moral obligation to ensure those who serve the State, offer protection to others at home and preserve peace abroad are themselves protected.<\/p>  <p>  The Offices of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is not an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints of the nature raised, given the seriousness of the allegations concerned, even if it accepts there are shortcomings in the ability of the office to deal with the issues arising from the Defence Forces.  One of the most serious of these is the fact that section 4 of the 2004 Act does not adequately provide for certain categories of interpersonal complaints, including inappropriate behaviour, sexual abuse and sexual harassment, among others.  This particular shortcoming means we do not have accurate data on allegations of this nature, nor does the ombudsman have the ability to conduct its own initial inquiries.  We have left it up to the internal investigation systems for too long.<\/p>  <p>  The women of honour need a statutory inquiry that has the power and scope to determine the scale and depth of the problems across the Defence Forces.  We have to examine the culture within the Defence Forces, not ignore it in favour of something lighter which will leave the women of honour feeling more abandoned than they already do.  That is how they have told us they feel.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces is a workplace and, as such, the Minister has to commit to a zero-tolerance approach towards bullying, harassment, discrimination, assault and all forms of gender-based violence in the workplace by establishing a full statutory inquiry into the allegations and their repercussions.  The women of honour most recently walked out of a meeting with the Minister because he would not address their concerns.  If he continues to ignore their demands, what he effectively will be doing is ignoring every other victim or potential victim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800026#Z00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1644340500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I would like to thank my colleague, Deputy Clarke, for bringing forward this motion in support of the women of honour.  We fully support their call for a full statutory inquiry.  We commend their courage and bravery.  We believe them and we will continue to stand with them.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt of the massive toll this has taken on them.  Like many whistleblowers, they went through an incredibly difficult process to bring this to light and, like many whistleblowers, they were driven by what is right.  These women have helped to blow the whistle on extremely serious allegations of abuse, sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination.  The fact that an organisation set up to protect could enact this kind of treatment on those within its own ranks is dumbfounding.  Like so many whistleblowers before them, the official channels failed them.  <\/p>  <p>  The measures proposed by the Minister to investigate these allegations are so inadequate as to be almost offensive.  They are, in the words of these women, ineffective and powerless to get to the real heart of the issue.  These women deserve a hell of a lot better than this.  These issues are long-standing; we all know this.  Dr. Tom Clonan's research into this kind of abuse laid it out in painstaking detail.  As part of his research, 60 female soldiers, sailors and air crew were surveyed.  Of these, 59 reported they had suffered abuse or discrimination and 12 said they had been sexually assaulted or raped.  At first, there were attempts to discredit this research before eventually the findings were accepted and we were told it would never happen again.  Yet, as Dr. Clonan said, the culture continues.<\/p>  <p>  It was only a couple of weeks ago that members of the Government said in this House that we had to change how women are treated in this State.  It is now within the power of the Minister to change how all women are treated.  It is within his power to change how women in our military are treated.  These women should be given the statutory inquiry for which they are calling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800026#Z00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1644340500,"counter":346,"content":"<p>We are finally, as a whole of society, shining a light into the very structure of our society and, in particular, on the role of women and how women are treated here.  Decades of campaigning for equality, during which incremental hard-won steps were made on that journey, still leave us a long way to travel.<\/p>  <p>  This House reflected the shared outrage of the Irish people at the brutal murder of Ashling Murphy recently.  Many more incidents of assault and harassment have come into the public domain since those statements were made here.  That day, we committed to the people of Ireland that the issue of violence, abuse, domestic or otherwise, and sexual assault would be rooted out of all areas of Irish life.  All of us, across all of these benches, committed to keeping a firm and constant focus on these matters.  I believe this motion falls squarely into this commitment, and I commend those who have moved it.  <\/p>  <p>  Military structures have been, for generations, overwhelmingly male and hierarchical.  That is true worldwide.  The opening of the Irish military to women, when 38 women became the first female recruits into our Defence Forces in October 1981, marked a sea change.  All institutions reflect the societies they exist in, good and bad.  If bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and discrimination are issues for our society as a whole, they are likely to be issues for institutions in that society, such as the military.  In fact, they are likely to be amplified by an institution that is structured on a hierarchy with a strong code of internal discipline and loyalty.  <\/p>  <p>  In that context, we, the public and their representatives depend on brave individuals to call out wrongdoing and stand up and demand proper, impartial and thorough investigations, the only function of which is to determine the truth, wherever it may lie and wherever the chips may fall.  The women of honour are those brave women.  They are willing to stand up and demand that their voices and those of others be heard and fully acted upon.<\/p>  <p>  I was privileged to draft and guide through these Houses the protected disclosures legislation, the so-called whistleblowers Act.  During that process, I listened to many cases of suppressed truth.  I examined many legal models to try to provide the best possible assistance to any person in a workplace, be it private or public, who witnesses or experiences wrongdoing and wants to call that out.  It is clear to me, after all of our debates and determination to build the best legal protection, that actually taking the step of calling out wrongdoing is very hard.  It is always infinitely easier to stay silent, to not draw attention to oneself and to endure, rather than to step out from the crowd and say that something needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>Too often - we have seen examples - the price paid by the whistleblower is a very high price indeed.  Therefore, in justice and in fairness what should our response be to the matters before us now - the brave and shocking testimony of women who shared their experiences of physical abuse, harassment, coercion and sexual assault?  There are others.  Men have also experienced abuse within our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to be a decent and fair-minded man.  He has proposed an independent judge-led review.  The day that he announced the review he stated, \"We need to establish this critical Independent Review to ensure that the Defence Forces is a safe workplace for all current serving members while also reviewing historical allegations\".  The Minister of State has outlined this review to the House.  He set out its membership and said that an interim report is to be provided within six months and a final report within 12 months.  However, the stated intention of the review as set out by the Minister is in fact two separate and distinct aims: first, to ensure that the Defence Forces is a safe workplace, which must be a priority; and second, to review so-called historical allegations.<\/p> <p> Many of us have long experience in this House.  Most of us know that without all the powers of compellability, taking sworn evidence in public and so on available to a statutory inquiry, an adequate investigation of the serious cases of abuse and misconduct that have been set out by the Women of Honour is highly unlikely to be fully ventilated.  That is our shared experience.  If we want to know the full facts, and find how these things happened and what the consequences are, we need a statutory inquiry to look into these matters.<\/p> <p> Separately, there is an urgent requirement to achieve the Minister's first stated objective.  He is an employer.  He is obliged morally and legally to provide a safe workplace for the members of the Defence Forces who turn up every day to do the unique work they undertake.  I firmly believe that the Minister needs to think again.  He is a decent man, as I have said and he is well intentioned.  I believe he has listened carefully to the voices of those who have suffered, but it is clear that each of his aims cannot be achieved by the mechanism he is now proposing.<\/p> <p> Having regard to the Women of Honour and their experience and having regard to the thousands of women and men currently serving, a different model is required.  Perhaps a twin model is required, one to examine the cases of abuse and a second to swiftly put in place robust and acceptable mechanisms for addressing complaints which replaces the current practices and mechanisms which clearly are not fit for purpose.<\/p> <p> The fact that in recent days we have heard further allegations of sexual assault, which nobody can categorise as historical, requires us to take action and requires the Minister to take action.  It cannot be delayed.  The overwhelming majority of our defence personnel need to be assured that they have a safe working environment and that whatever culture existed in the past which undermined that safe working environment must be eliminated.  We need robust mechanisms to deal with them.  Therefore, the Government needs to put in place a safe working environment.  That can be done swiftly.  Separately, it needs to establish a statutory inquiry to provide the full unvarnished truth to those honourable women who have set out their experiences for all of us to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800026#Z00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644341100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in and in particularly Deputy Clarke for tabling this motion today.  It is certainly a timely debate that needs to be had.  The very antithesis of restorative justice is to retraumatise the victims.  That is not the first time I have used those words in this Chamber related to a group of people, in particular women, who have been wronged in a most gruesome fashion.  I have said that the interaction they have had with the State has compounded their suffering as they have sought justice for the wrongs inflicted on them.<\/p>  <p>  I thought about that statement again last week when, at the invitation of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, I along with Opposition Deputies sat in the audiovisual room of Leinster House and listened to the testimony of three incredible people who are part of a collective of survivors of abuse in our Defence Forces who came to be known as the Women of Honour.  Honourable those women certainly are.  Having first become aware of their experiences through the RT&Eacute; programme of the same title presented by Katie Hannon and then through an exchange of emails with the group and through the extensive media coverage since, I thought I was familiar with the harrowing truths they were once again sharing with a room of strangers in search of justice and necessary reform of our Defence Forces.  However, there is something altogether different about sitting in a room with women outlining their experiences of harassment, bullying, sexual assault and rape which shakes the body to its very core while staring into the whites of their eyes as they outlined their case.<\/p>  <p>  Adding to the sense of anger in the room was the fact that the women in front of us had just returned from another unsatisfactory meeting with the Taoiseach that very same day.  In previous days they had taken a decision to walk out in frustration from a meeting with the Minister for Defence, having felt that the promises made to them previously as to their involvement in the drafting of the terms of reference or the form of the inquiry into the abuse which they suffered would take had been reneged upon.<\/p>  <p>  Sitting in that room last Monday, I and other Deputies present could not help but wonder why the architecture of our Republic always makes it so bloody difficult for those wronged while in the care or employ of the State to make right the wrongs which they have experienced once they have been brought to light.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for the establishment of a commission of investigation into abuse, assault and rape experienced by the Women of Honour and other men and women in our Defence Forces.  It is a motion supported by the very people who experienced those horrors while in the service of the State.  I see no reason to debate any further avenues, which survivors have already expressed no confidence in.  That we are even here today debating the reasons an internal review into abuse, sexual assault and rape is not a satisfactory avenue for justice for the people who have experienced that very same abuse raises fundamental questions for me about in whose interest we seek to govern here and what exactly it means to be a custodian of a Department in our Republic.<\/p>  <p>  The women of honour we speak of today and other men and women wronged while in the Defence Forces at every level have called for a commission of investigation with statutory powers.  Neither the State nor any of us in this Chamber has any legitimacy in denying them that right and insisting upon a style of inquiry in which those who seek truths have no confidence.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that as we speak here today there is an ongoing debate on the role, purpose and capacity of our Defence Forces.  As I sat before the Women of Honour last week, I wondered why anybody would choose a life in our armed services at this moment.  Women and men subsequently came to me and outlined the corrosive culture where bullying exists and where internal reviews are not done in a satisfactory way.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I find it almost insulting that I had to leave one committee meeting on foreign affairs to come to another really important D&aacute;il debate on an issue of incredible importance.  I cannot be at both.  If I, simply as a spokesperson for my party on these issues, cannot be in two places in once, how can a Minister think they can control both of those Departments when so many ongoing issues of importance are happening?<\/p>  <p>  In a Republic, I fundamentally believe that institutions decay in the absence of ministerial control.  Today's newspapers carry another report of a lockdown party outside McKee Barracks where a female soldier was assaulted by a military officer.  We see the commission into the future of our Defence Forces finding that our Defence Forces are in disarray be that air, sea or land.<\/p> <p>They have absolutely no capacity.  Retention levels among their personnel are at an all-time low, and we must wonder why that is.  I would surmise that some of the experiences we are hearing about have led to that.  If nobody is in control, accountability does not exist.  From the very office of the Minister right down to the rank and file, there seems to be an absence of leadership and of investment not only in the capacity of our Defence Forces but also in the morale of those we ask to stand forward and serve.  All these conversations about how we defend ourselves have to start with how we look after, manage and respect the very personnel we expect to put themselves in harm's way.<\/p> <p> I know very well, coming as I do from an inner-city environment, where many people, young fellas in particular but young girls too, aspire to be in the Defence Forces, that there is a great pride in going into our Defence Forces.  People to this day are proud of that.  We had a trip to Haulbowline several months ago and I went down to a naval base that is almost dystopian in the sense that it has ships that cannot go out to sea because we do not have the personnel to manage them.  The members of the Navy sitting there wanting to go to sea are really proud to be in that environment and to represent and to serve our country.  We talk about the overseas missions in which they have been involved, in particular in taking people from the waters.  However, they also talk about the fact that they cannot provide for their families and find it difficult to pay their rent.  Some of them are putting off having families because they cannot afford to do so.  They talk about the conditions.  I remember that a couple of years ago, when the Pope visited, armed personnel were asked to sleep on the ground.  Then we go further into this and find that not only do the conditions they speak of exist but the conditions of bullying, harassment, assault in some cases and a horrific misogynistic culture still exists in the Defence Forces and nobody seems to have their foot on the brake.  What I witnessed last week, staring into the eyes of the Women of Honour, was an endemic culture in our Defence Forces that is simply toxic.  There are so many proud people in the Defence Forces, but the infrastructure of the State does not seem willing to support them.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a motion seeking a statutory commission of investigation.  We cannot deny that.  It echoes the sentiments that have been expressed by people who have suffered abuse of the most horrific form in the Defence Forces.  It is incumbent on us to go back to the drawing board.  If people who have experienced this abuse are telling us they have no trust or confidence in the manner in which that will be reviewed, there is absolutely no legitimacy in denying them that - none.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800027#AA00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644341700,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister will agree that many of the allegations of the Women of Honour relate to incidents that are heinous in nature.  Women have been subjected to gross violations.  A culture of sexism is absolutely unacceptable in any workplace.  This cannot be seen in isolation; it must be seen as society-wide and in the context of how sexism and misogyny circulate in society.  When women come forward, they do so to challenge terrible historical and present abuses.  We have seen that through the #MeToo movement, whereby women across the world challenge terrible sexism and violations committed against them.<\/p>  <p>  There is an obligation on the State to investigate the allegations of the Women of Honour.  That is most important.  There needs to be rigorous scrutiny in that regard.  That can be done only through a public inquiry.  That is what the women want.  They are the most important voice in this debate.  The independent review, as far as I understand, cannot compel witnesses to testify - the Minister might correct me if I am wrong on that - which means that it brings on a different definition.  There was no consultation with the Women of Honour on the terms of reference of the review.  They were largely ignored, which is very unfortunate.  The women at the heart of this discussion were not consulted on those terms of reference.  The women said this review or a public inquiry does not have to take years but must have teeth and must compel people to come along to testify on the reasons they engaged in this behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  When the report is finalised - I think a period of six to nine months was referred to - it will not detail any specific incidence that happened, which is again very unfortunate.  It is disappointing, to say the least, that the review will not make any recommendations on the assessments to which these women were subjected.  Overall, and as we have said in the past few minutes, we need a public inquiry because that will ensure robust scrutiny of what has gone on and is probably still going on in the workplaces of the armed forces.  A review is just not good enough at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800028#BB00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1644341700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>\"Allegations such as those revealed at McKee Barracks should not remain within the military system to investigate ...  A similar regime was operated within the [Catholic] Church in which canon law was applied in horrific cases of sex abuse.  It was not tolerated there, and it should not be tolerated in the Defence Forces.\"  Those are strong words today from Women of Honour group.  As for the comparison with the Catholic Church, my understanding is that they are talking about an institution which is not covered by the civil law but has its own set of laws - Canon law for the church, military law for the Defence Forces.  Those are strong words and I endorse them.  I also note that we have today another case coming to light of a female apprentice in the Air Corps repeatedly being sent unsolicited lewd images from a colleague.  These cases point to a rotten culture in the Defence Forces.  Clearly, it is not a case of just one or two bad apples.  A rigid, hierarchical command structure, low pay, poor conditions and the denial of trade union rights are a lethal combination, certainly for vulnerable women members of the forces.<\/p>  <p>  An ICTU survey in 2019 found that four fifths of workers experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace do not report the incident to their employers.  If that is the case in unionised workplaces, what is the position in workplaces where trade union organisation is banned and the workplace is run by command?  The case of the Women of Honour needs to be treated more seriously by this Government.  There must be no cover-ups.  There should be a statutory inquiry with the ability to compel witnesses to attend and to give evidence and the ability to access in full all relevant documents and material.<\/p>  <p>  This year, International Women's Day, 8 March, must be a day of protest and of action on the streets of Ireland to demand real action on the issue of gender violence.

I thank Deputy Clarke and her party for bringing it forward.  It is very important matter to be discussing here this evening.  I thank the Women of Honour group and the other groups that came forward to tell their harrowing stories over recent weeks and months.  I have three points to make in the time allowed to me.  The first is that we have to accept that we once again have a problem with sexual harassment and sexual assault in the Defence Forces.  It had reduced radically in the noughties but, unfortunately, it is back.  The main reason it is back is because it is now a problem across society.  If it is in society, it is in the Defence Forces because the Defence Forces are a microcosm of that society.  It is in most workplaces in the country.  We even had our own difficulties here in the parliamentary community last year.<\/p>  <p>  I will identify a couple of risk factors.  Obviously, there is no excuse whatsoever for sexual harassment or sexual assault but, if we are to look at improving and targeting particular areas to stamp it out once again, we should consider this list of risk factors.  The first is accommodation.  It is very unusual in an Irish workplace to have accommodation, beds and ablutions on site.  It is an area we have to focus on in order to stamp this out.  The second relates to alcohol.  It is very unusual to have alcohol in a workplace.  I have been on a number of overseas tours of duty myself and, when there is alcohol, there is trouble.  The best trips are those without it.  I commend the recent decision to make the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, trip alcohol-free for Irish troops.  That is a very good and positive step.  It is something that should be considered for all overseas trips at this stage.  Another risk factor is that women are very much in the minority.  Only 6% of members of the Defence Forces are female.  That needs to improve.  A critical mass is needed so that they have supports available and are not seen as a minority group.  The extended periods of time spent away from home are also a risk factor.  <\/p>  <p>  The most important and biggest risk factor I have identified over the last ten years is the major upheaval the Defence Forces have been through in that time.  It is not an excuse in any shape or form but it is a contributing factor.  Many seasoned commanders and many seasoned, experienced and highly qualified enlisted leaders who would have properly supervised their troops and pointed out where they were going wrong and any inappropriate behaviours and attitudes have left.  That critical piece is missing.  The turnover rate in the Defence Forces is approximately 10%, a rate that shows dysfunction.  Statistically, almost the entire population of the Defence Forces is renewed every ten years.  There are people in the organisation who are strangers because they have just come in and there is very little mentoring or supervision.<\/p>  <p>  How do we address this?  I am in favour of the four Ps - perhaps Deputy Clarke has heard of them - of prevention, protection, prosecution and policy intervention.  The prevention piece is very important.  I presume and hope there is to be an awareness campaign within the Defence Forces as soon as possible to change the attitudes and behaviours of a minority, which need to be addressed.  From a protection point of view, there needs to be safe areas in military installations.  From a prosecution point of view, we need a dedicated subunit within the Military Police Corps to investigate specific sexual harassment and sexual assault cases.  On the policy intervention piece, we need to review our policies to make sure they are in accordance with the best international standards and are effective on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces is reporting tomorrow.  That document needs to be implemented as soon as possible.  From what I have heard and what I have read in publicly available reports, I understand that it calls for a significant increase in the number of women in the Defence Forces from the current 6% to something like 25%, 30% or whatever it says.  That is the kind of intervention that is required to make sure that women are not a minority in their own organisation and to make sure they know they belong.  <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the clock.  To repeat myself, we all need to fully accept that there is an issue in the Defence Forces in respect of sexual harassment and sexual assault.  There is hope because the Defence Forces have improved in the past.  The issue was almost entirely eradicated in the late noughties but, unfortunately, it is back.  We have to do everything in our power to ensure that our armed forces display the standards, ethics and morals we expect of the armed forces of this type of country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800029#CC00100","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1644342300,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that the Minister for Defence is not here.  Perhaps there is a reasonable excuse for that.  Maybe he has an important job to do.  However, this is a very important debate and one of enormous gravity.  It is a debate on a matter the Minister is directly responsible for so it is disappointing that he is not here.<\/p>  <p>  The Women of Honour are simply women who wanted to work in the service of the State.  These women put their lives on the line and at risk for the rest of the citizens of this country.  Shockingly, their service was met with assault, rape, abuse, bullying and discrimination in a State service.  Given that their employer was the Government itself, it is incredible that this was allowed to happen.  When they sought justice within their employment location, justice was blocked and prevented.  On many occasions, instead of the perpetrators of the abuse being punished, the women themselves were punished while seeking justice.  It appears that there was a culture within the Defence Forces which sought to protect the organisation against attack.  Where have we seen that before?  Unfortunately, practically every organisation instinctively feels the need to protect itself from those who are seeking justice or reform of the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  These women were forced to break their anonymity and to tell their absolutely harrowing stories.  It is extremely hard for anyone to open up publicly about the shocking wrongs done to them.  I give full credit to these women for the work they have done.  This country owes a serious debt of gratitude to those women for what they are seeking to do and the manner in which they have sought to do it.  Some of these women have taken on the equivalent of an unpaid full-time job to achieve reform in the Defence Forces.  In case the Government has not noticed, that is its job, for which its members are very well paid.  I also give credit to Katie Hannon for her documentary, which first gave voice to these women on the national airwaves.<\/p>  <p>  The Women of Honour group met with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, a number of months ago and he promised to finally listen to them.  He also committed to giving them a role in the path to justice.  He stated that he would facilitate their shaping of the terms of reference of any investigation that happened.  I have worked closely with the Women of Honour over recent months and I was quite shocked that this was the Minister's response.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Government was doing this because, in my experience, governments do not do that.  Governments normally protect the organisation that is under strain.  For decades, governments have protected organisation after organisation against those who have sought to reform them.  However, my cynical distrust of the Government has proven correct.<\/p>  <p>  In practically a mirror image of what is happening to the women involved in the CervicalCheck scandal, Ministers have spoken in the media and in this D&aacute;il in measured tones about their shock at what is happening to people in this country.  They have said that they will root out the causes of the difficulties and make sure they never happen again.  However, similarly to the 300 women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal who find themselves having to go before the High Court to seek justice, the Women of Honour have been let down with regard to the promises given to them by this Government.  The Government's words in respect of the Women of Honour have proven meaningless.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s credibility stands in stark contrast with the actions of the Women of Honour.  His credibility has been hammered.  He has reneged on the promise of a fully independent and external commission of investigation into bullying, discrimination and sexual violence in the Defence Forces.  He has also reneged on his promise to tackle the systemic resistance within the Defence Forces which prevents victims and survivors from achieving justice.  I ask the Minister of State to make sure we draw a line and to ensure that Ministers' actions match their words and that the Government provides justice for what probably  would be the first time in the history of our governments.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State go back to the well, speak to these women again, allow them to have influence over the terms of reference and ensure they are provided with what they deserve, namely, a full commission of investigation into what is happening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800029#CC00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644342900,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Berry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800030#DD00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1644342900,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I have already spoken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800030#DD00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1644342900,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Okay.

The group has criticised this approach and said that such investigations into alleged sexual assaults &quot;still remain to be dealt with within the military system&quot;.  It has further said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is time for an independent public statutory inquiry and for the civil and criminal laws of the State to be applied to the Defence Forces ....

It has further stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMilitary police, in reality, are subject to the chain of command and act on behalf of the Defence Forces, investigate internal matters and then send a file to the Director of Military Prosecutions.

It believes that &quot;the frequency of [these] dreadful allegations&quot; has resulted in &quot;a toxic culture of [the] acceptance of cover-ups and victim blaming&quot;, which should of course not be tolerated.

To be quite honest, this matter sounds as bad as it gets.  We are talking about people who work hard in their jobs and then to think that this type of abuse is going on.  While this case is slightly different, it is unfortunate that it is not the first time that treatment of the Defence Forces has reached rock bottom.  In July 2019, the Minister of State was recorded as saying that \"morale [was] at an all-time low\" under the then Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  I refer to it being suggested that issues concerning pay, recruitment and retention were being shockingly handled by the then Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  That was scandalous, but these current public allegations must be dealt with immediately.  I call on the Minister of State to do everything in his power to ensure that a full commission of investigation is set up.

I have to take issue with him on that unless he can show me the evidence.  I would like to know what analysis exists on the number of men and women who left the Defence Forces in that time due to sexual harassment, assault or a prevailing culture of fear of reprisals.  It is a legitimate question to ask.  What analysis has been done on the downgrading of accusations of serious sexual assault to minor breaches of discipline under a particular section of the Defence Acts?  How many persons have had such minor charges laid against them after being accused of serious assault and have then been transferred or relocated?  These are essential questions if we are to take at face value what the Deputy said.<\/p><p>I am not personalising this in respect of the Deputy.  It is just that he highlighted this.  When he said, and he is correct, that there has been a decline, what he is saying really if he looks at the facts is that there has been a decline in the number of investigations.  In the 1980s, there were 54; in the 1990s, 35; in the 2000s, 20; and in the 2010s, 17.  The number of investigations has reduced but we have to ask why.  Were the women or, indeed, men afraid of reprisals?  What are the reasons?  What analysis has been done?  It is a dangerous conclusion to come to in light of the ongoing reports of further allegations against women.  I take issue with that completely.  I would also like the Minister of State for clarification.  I think some of those figures came from an article in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>or <i>Irish Independent<\/i>towards the end of last year, based on a report that was given to the Minister.  Are any of the Ministers of State present aware of that?  Have they the report to hand?  Could they enlighten me?  Is that where all of these figures have been set out?  What conclusions were drawn from them?  Were they the conclusions Deputy Berry is entitled to draw or are there other conclusions that should be drawn from them if we are going to learn?<\/p><p>I have the greatest of respect for the judge.  She is an independent, female judge with lots of experience and she has shown her mettle.  If she can rise above the pathetic terms of reference, fair play to her.  Fair play to her if she can produce a report within the time allowed, which seems to change depending on which Minister is talking - a draft one at six months, something else at nine months, something else at 12 months.  If that can be done within the terms of reference I will take my hat off and I will be the first to apologise here.  We have the three overall aims of the independent review, which I have quoted before and will not quote again.

I will come back to the Women of Honour; should the men and women decide not to participate who should go forward, the others, if they decide not to, that is it.  Goodbye.  There is nothing that can be done about that.  Term of reference No. 13, at the bottom, finally refers to historical matters, &quot;to advise whether further work is required to examine the issues of an historical nature and to make any recommendations regarding how this might pursued&quot;.  Of course, that is No. 13.  Perhaps the Ministers of State will tell me the recommendations are not ranked but it is interesting that it is coming last.  It is interesting that the time is a movable feast.<\/p><p>Most significant and beyond interesting is that the women who had the courage to come forward are not going to participate, which makes the whole inquiry very difficult.  That might be an understatement.  If they are not going to participate and they are responsible for highlighting all of this, it begs the question as to how it can work.  The very terms of reference, if the Ministers of State look at them, state that they are going to examine the policies, practices and procedures on the ground to see if they align with dignity.  We know well they do not align with dignity because we have had a whole series of allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault down to rape.  Now we are going to look at the policies.  We are not going to look at what the women and men have told us about what happened to them.  We believe them.  The three monkeys come to mind - hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil - but do the evil and have no accountability. <\/p><p>Forgive me for my cynicism.  Before I speak, myself and my assistants in my office usually try to look, study and examine the necessary documentation.  I have done that.  When I look back to see if my cynicism and my questions are justified, going back to Tom Clonan in 2000, I see what happened to that man.  His research was discredited.  When he stuck to his guns and the discrediting programme did not work, a review was set up which I will come back to.  Subsequently Tom Clonan, I understand, said he understood and believed that the changes had occurred, in good faith.  Then I realise he had been duped.  Maybe that is too strong a word.  Maybe his belief that systems could change was not based on reality.  My experience in a number of different roles is that institutions do not change.  If institutions changed, we would not have needed Katie Hannon's documentary on RT&Eacute; or the women's courage in coming forward.  That is what has led to this.  To add insult to that, we do not allow them to take part in the discussion on the terms of reference.  The Minister of State spoke about having met them on a number of occasions, or the Taoiseach and the Minister, which was very nice.  The important thing was to have them engage in the terms of reference, which did not happen.<\/p><p>Let us look back.  We have Tom Clonan's research.  A number of his findings have been cited in respect of the situation at the time.  &quot;Women in combat: The status and roles assigned to female personnel.&quot;  This featured anonymised interviews with 60 female officers, 59 of whom suffered abuse or discrimination and 12 of whom said they had been sexually assaulted or raped.  This also included bullying and sexual harassment including rape and so on.  In 2019, Tom Clonan said that he believed the Defence Forces had taken it on board.  That was done some time after 2000.  Clearly they had not.  Following his research in 2002, an independent review panel was set up.  There was one external woman on it out of five people.  It was set up to review existing policies and procedures.  That was 20 years ago; we were reviewing existing policies and procedures and now we are going to set up another independent review to review it.<\/p><p>Following on from that, we had a monitoring committee, which was excellent.  The Minister for Defence seems to misunderstand what a monitoring committee does.  It produced three reports.  On the last occasion in 2014 it made three specific recommendations.  No Minister here today has referred to that.  The Minister used words to the effect that it did not do its job because the culture had not changed.  The culture had not changed because the Ministers over the years had not done their job.  Army management had not done its job.  The only ones who had done their job were the members of the monitoring committee that highlighted what still needed to be done.  What do we do?  We abolished it and did not re-establish it, notwithstanding that Mark Mellett wrote to the Minister of State with responsibility for defence at the time, in January 2019, asking for it to be re-established.  At that point they were investigating 15 cases of alleged misconduct by personnel in 2019.  <\/p> <p> I am nearing the end of my time.  I am speaking on the basis of having done research and thought about this subject and out of respect for the Women of Honour group, whose members have come forward in this public way to tell of the most horrific abuse.  We get a review of policies and procedures to see if they align.  I cannot imagine how more insulting it could get.  At the very least, I would have expected a detailed speech on the actions to date following on from the various reports, why the independent monitoring committee was not renewed and why the recommendations were not acted on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800031#EE00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644344100,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for presenting the Government's opening statement.  Unfortunately, due to a change in times by the Business Committee, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is unable to present the closing statement.  He sends his apologies to the House.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputy Clarke for raising this matter under Private Members' business.  This discussion is important and deals with serious issues that are a priority for the Minister for Defence.  I assure the House that the Government is committed to providing a safe place of work for members of the Defence Forces, with a zero-tolerance approach to unacceptable behaviour, while also examining ways of addressing allegations of an historical nature.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the strong views of a number of colleagues in the House, including calls for a statutory inquiry.  I echo the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers's comments that the Women of Honour have displayed tremendous courage in sharing their experiences and that the matters they have raised are serious.  I also extend my appreciation to the members of the Men and Women of Honour group for coming forward to share their experiences with the Minister, departmental officials and, more recently, the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the references in the motion to the legal and moral obligations to all members of the Defence Forces.  It is for this reason that the Minister is proceeding with this independent review.  My colleague has an immediate duty of care to serving members of the Defence Forces to ensure that they can carry out their duties in a workplace that is safe and has a culture underpinned by dignity and equality.  This is what the review group is currently examining and why the independent review is so important.  Recent media coverage of an alleged incident last year has only reinforced the thinking on this.<\/p>  <p>  In taking this first critical step, the Minister has the full support of serving personnel and other stakeholders, including the Men and Women of Honour group.  It is what they need and expect him to deliver.  Their views and the views of the representative associations have informed the terms of reference.  In those terms, my colleague has specified that the Department of Defence will be included in the scope of the review group's work.  This was a particular request of the Women of Honour group.  I do not accept, therefore, that the terms of reference fail to recognise the seriousness of this issue.  They offer sufficient scope to determine the scale and depth of the problems across the Defence Forces.  The terms of reference are wide ranging and provide the review group with the scope to examine the end-to-end process for making a complaint of unacceptable behaviour and to assess whether there are barriers to serving personnel making complaints and fully and actively engaging in the process.  The review group will also examine the extent to which reprisal, the fear of reprisal or the existence of a culture of silence or complicity may act as a barrier to reporting or investigating as well as any indication of inconsistencies or challenges in the application of policies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to incorporating a number of views from stakeholders, the independent review's terms of reference are based to a large extent on those developed by the departments of defence in Canada, the UK and the USA where similar serious workplace issues were identified to those encountered in the Irish Defence Forces.  The Attorney General's office provided the Minister with advice on a range of matters, including the terms.  My colleague was also advised on this approach by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  I am fully satisfied, therefore, that the terms are sufficiently broad to allow the independent review group members significant latitude to explore the areas that they need to explore and to make recommendations for future actions.  I should add that the secretariat function will operate independently of the Department of Defence under the direction of the membership of the review group.  The review group is led by the recently retired High Court judge, Ms Bronagh O'Hanlon, who will bring valuable independent, external and unbiased expertise to this body of work.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague has set an ambitious timetable for the review group.  He looks forward to receiving the interim report in six months.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have confirmed with the Women of Honour group that the Government is not ruling out an inquiry in future.<\/p>  <p>  Former members of the Defence Forces have been incredibly courageous in coming forward to share their experiences.  The allegations of an historical nature are not being ignored, but we have to take this first step.  The independent review group has been specifically asked to consider if a further body of work will be required.  If such a recommendation is made, the Government will consider it.<\/p>  <p>  The interim supports that the Minister put in place last October, to which my colleague, the Minister of State, referred, are there for people who have been affected by these issues.  The confidential contact person and the 24-7 Inspire counselling service are important support mechanisms and they are being utilised.  In addition, the personnel support service, PSS, within the Defence Forces assists members and their immediate families through the provision of information and advice on areas, including stress management, counselling and referral options.<\/p>  <p>  The serious issues raised by the Women of Honour and serving members will not be resolved overnight.  It will take time, but we have made a start.  While I understand that the Women of Honour are disappointed that a statutory inquiry is not being established at this time, I hope that they understand the need for this independent review as a first step in meeting our immediate obligations to serving members.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference provide that submissions can be made to the review group and that former and serving members of the Defence Forces may engage with it and share their experiences.  I hope that all stakeholders, including the Women of Honour group, will avail of this opportunity and engage with the process.  Their contribution will be important in moving this forward.<\/p>  <p>  I echo what my colleague, the Minister of State, said in his contribution.  Those who may have suffered serious wrongs of a criminal nature, whether recent or historical, should report their concerns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has the lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate such matters.  I strongly urge anyone who may have been subject to any such alleged abuse or harassment to seek professional help and guidance, which is available from State agencies such as the HSE or from registered charities that specialise in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate in the strongest possible terms the Minister, Deputy Coveney's commitment, and that of the Government, to addressing these issues in the most comprehensive and efficient way possible.  I assure colleagues that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will engage with the independent review group in respect of their respective roles and functions now that the review is under way.  Therefore, I ask the House to allow the independent review group the time to undertake this important work and to support the Government's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800032#FF00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344100,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I do not doubt that the Minister has determined to look into a system to deal with these complaints and the long-term issues that have been highlighted by the Women of Honour, but the fact remains that we in this State have a long history of failing those who have suffered abuse, of not learning from the past and of not putting in place systems that work.<\/p>  <p>  The criterion that matters in this situation is the statement by Women of Honour that this approach will not cut the mustard.  Like many others, I commend the Women of Honour on their bravery in highlighting these issues, which have lasted for many years and have not been addressed.  Regardless of whether the Government or the Department had intentions of dealing with this and putting in place a system that was fit for purpose, we have not gone far enough.  This is like some of the conversations the D&aacute;il has had in recent years about historical abuse by the State and how the State is still failing to do that piece of work whereby the people who have suffered such abuse are taken across the line to a system that is fit for purpose, works for them and can provide them with the answers they require.<\/p> <p>That they have not added their voices to that of those who may believe what has been offered can do the business it is meant to speaks for itself.  The Women of Honour are the people the Government needed to sign off on this, but they have not done so.  That is where most of the Irish people will lie in regard to this issue.<\/p> <p> We all accept the need for a proper system for complaints against those who have engaged in sexual harassment or abuse so people will face the repercussions necessary.  We need to ensure in the longer term that this work is done; however, first and foremost, we are starting from a bad place in the sense that what has been proposed is not being accepted by Women of Honour.<\/p> <p> We have all engaged in the wider conversation on violence, abuse and the issues with which women across society must deal.  The problem was highlighted to us by the dreadful murder of Ashling Murphy.  Reports on other alleged attacks of women have also entered the public domain.  We are listening more keenly now.  I have been always aware of the work done locally by the likes of Women's Aid and Rape Crisis Centre North East but I am more keenly aware of it now.  I am aware of their underfunding and of services that are not fit to deal with the issues that arise.  If we are truly serious about this entire matter and wish to deal with it, we will have to carry out a needs analysis, have the genuine conversations and ensure we provide resources.<\/p> <p> Whether we are talking about the Defence Forces or wider society, we all accept that we have to do specific work that involves everyone questioning themselves regarding how they operate, what they call out and what they have failed to call out to date, thus creating a culture that does not allow for any gender-based violence, harassment or abuse, or any such behaviours that are utterly unacceptable to the vast majority.  We just need to ensure we leave no space for these behaviours in society.<\/p> <p> As regards the issue in question and Women of Honour, what the latter deserve and what they are getting are not the same.  They have been failed by the State over and over.  They are not happy with what is being put on offer at this point.  Therefore, the Minister needs to re-engage and get their endorsement.  That is an absolute requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800032#FF00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, confirm whether he is here as Minister of State at the Department of Defence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":371,"content":"<p>When he referred in his opening statement to meetings he and his colleagues have had with stakeholders, was he doing so as Minister of State at the Department of Defence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00400","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Questions are not permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00500","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The reason I ask is that in a reply to a parliamentary question by my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, Deputy Coveney, who is the Minister for Defence, stated, \"No functions of the Minister for Defence have been delegated to the Minister of State and full responsibility for defence policies, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces remains with Minister Coveney who will continue to represent Defence at Cabinet.\"  That is further evidence of the lack of seriousness in the Government's approach to this issue.  That is deeply disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said in his opening statement that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has an immediate obligation to serving members to ensure the workplace is safe and that there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour in the Defence Forces.  If the Minister is so concerned with the speed of change regarding that duty of care, does he not see that the commencement of an effective and accountable statutory inquiry would lead to an immediate change of behaviour, meaning the culture of unaccountability effectively would be over?  Does he not see that the resistance to the inquiry might embolden those who behave unacceptably, based on the perception that the Minister somehow has their back.  <\/p>  <p>  I take issue with the fact that the Government amendment states that \"unfortunately the systems, policies and workplace culture in the Defence Forces have not, and are not, serving all personnel well\".  It is not unfortunate that somebody may be raped, that somebody may be harassed and that there are women in the position of Ms Diane Byrne, who ended up taking the State to court over the way she was treated when she was pregnant as a serving member of the Defence Forces; it is an absolute disgrace.  So, too, is what happened to Ms Yvonne O'Rourke, who had to take the State to the Workplace Relations Commission and who won in December 2020 after years of battling.  At that point, Mr. Bonnlander, from the Workplace Relations Commission, stated, \"It beggars belief that women should have been serving in the Irish Defence Forces for decades, without the Forces' systems and instruction ever having been appropriately updated to ensure they reflect anti-discrimination law as it applies to pregnancy and maternity.\"  Where was the urgency there?  I have asked the Minister.  Distinct recommendations were made by the Workplace Relations Commission, one of which was to make a payment to Ms O'Rourke for the delay in the investigation and hearing.  The Defence Forces did not withdraw their jurisdictional objections earlier than the closing arguments at the hearing.  That is not unfortunate; that is an absolute disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission ordered the Defence Forces to carry out measures to combat pregnancy-related and other forms of discrimination, with all such work to be complete by December 2021.  In March 2021, I asked the Minister about this.  I was told it was currently being considered.  In September 2021, I asked again and was told the directions were being implemented by the military authorities.  Therefore, the arguments of concern and wanting to see systemic change immediately for serving members simply do not hold up to scrutiny.  The Minister of State knows as well as we do on this side of the House that the only genuinely effective mechanism to bring about the systemic change needed is a statutory inquiry.  Failing to deliver on that is failing to meet not only the needs of the Women of Honour but also the needs and expectations of those who serve today, be it in the Army, Naval Service or Air Corps.  It will fail to serve them in the future.  That is truly not what the Minister wants as a legacy.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00600","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644344700,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00800","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2022: Messages from Select Committees","time":1644344700,"counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1644344700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2022: Votes 20, 21, 22, 24, 41 and 44.<\/p><p>The Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the service of the year ending on 31 December 2021: Vote 29.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800033#GG01000","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1644345300,"counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800034#HH00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","time":1644345300,"counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800034#HH00200"},{"type":"question","time":1644345300,"counter":380,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[6457\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800034#HH00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps that are being taken to increase places at third level for in-demand courses to address skill shortages and take unnecessary pressure off the leaving certificate system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1644345300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>The Government has decided to deny the students the choice when it comes to this year's leaving certificate.

One such course is medicine.  I fully agree that from a public health policy point of view, we need more doctors.  As she will be aware, it is not just a case of creating a college place, because for every place on a medicine course, a training hospital place is required.  It is a similar story with dentistry and a number of other courses.  What my Department has been doing for the past number of months, and is intensifying now, is trying to work with Department of Health to identify whether we can provide X number more of funded medicine places in September across our college system and the Department of Health can provide Y more training places.

I have some positive news and perhaps we can build on it.  Inclusion is a core goal for my Department, for the House and for Members on all sides of this House.  It is about ensuring that there is access and equity of access for all students of both further and higher education.  It is most likely that we will publish a new national access and inclusion plan with a budget of &euro;5 million to deliver on measures in 2022 in March.<\/p> <p>While higher education institutions, HEIs, are autonomous, the approach of my Department has been to offer a range of supports that enable them to meet national objectives, including those relating to inclusion and supports for people with disabilities.  Last year, for example, we provided &euro;5.8 million in funding for initiatives in 24 HEIs aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education.  That has delivered a variety of projects, including sensory spaces, training of staff, development of assistive technology, mental health supports, development of wayfinding apps to help students with disabilities navigate their way around campuses, and capital accessibility improvements to campuses.  This strategic projects fund was additional to the standard fund for students with disabilities.<\/p> <p> As regards the specific question on buildings and estates, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is in the process of finalising what it describes as a detailed space survey of the higher education estate.  As part of this survey, HEIs have been asked to indicate the compliance of their buildings with part M of the building regulations, which addresses access for people with disabilities.  The survey will be regularly updated and progress on the issue will be monitored and reported going forward.  Institutions can address issues of non-compliance - of course, people have to be helped to become compliant - using funding from devolved capital grants or as part of a broader building upgrade project.  In this respect, I am pleased I will this week launch a new phase of capital investment calls that will include an emphasis on alignment with universal design principles and fostering inclusion in all its facets.<\/p> <p> The Deputy is onto a very important issue here.

It is welcome that will include this emphasis on universal design principles.  What both I and the Labour Party spokesperson on higher education, Senator Hoey, have been hearing is that many students and potential students who are not even counted in figures kept by universities and colleges on students with disabilities require greater levels of accommodation and support.  It is thought that as many as 20% of students currently in higher education have a disability.  That is a sizeable minority of students, not all of whom may have indicated to college authorities that they are in that cohort.  There are potential students who would like to go to college but need greater encouragement, facilitation and support to do so.  My experience of engagement as a college tutor for many years with the disability office in Trinity College Dublin is that the office is superb but students with disabilities do not want to have to raise concerns about access at every interval.  That is why universal design principles are so crucial.  They should be accommodated in building design so that students do not have to keep asking.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the capital funding allocations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800035#JJ00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1644345900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I find myself in full agreement with the Deputy.  To be honest, one of my concerns in respect of the national access plan, which has achieved a lot, is exactly what she and Senator Hoey have identified, that is, there are people with disabilities not counted within those figures.  I think of students with autism or those with intellectual disabilities or dyslexia.  There are others who are not counted.  There is more work to be done in respect of students with visual impairments and the likes.  I had a very good meeting recently with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, and the Dyslexia Association of Ireland regarding some of the assistive technology they introduced during the pandemic and how they wish to now make that permanent and spread it.  I have had very good meetings with, and visits to, the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities, which the Deputy knows very well.  It is quite an inspiring place.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the capital plan, she should expect a more comprehensive definition of a student with a disability in the national access and inclusion plan, as she and Senator Hoey are suggesting.

Building on the remarks of the Minister, it also reported that the number of students with disabilities in third level is growing, which is very welcome and largely to do with the successful access programmes and disability offices and centres such as the inspirational centre at Trinity College Dublin to which he referred.  However, the number of students with sensory disabilities, visual or hearing impairment or severe speech impairment is not growing at the same rate.  It is clear the access programmes for students in those particular groups are not having the same effect and that needs to be examined.  There are several related issues in respect of facilitation in studying abroad and engaging in work placements, all of which would be of significant support and benefit to any student who is able to participate.  Again, of course, those with disabilities may find additional obstacles facing them in taking up places on Erasmus+ programmes, internships or work programmes.

Many students in general, but particularly students with disabilities, have told me they would like things that became commonplace during the pandemic, such as recorded lectures, to become embedded.  Obviously, that requires discussion with staff representative bodies but we want it to happen.  I refer to initiatives such as the wayfinding app, where people have been able to use assistive technology.

However, the Deputy will appreciate that education and training providers have been closed for extended periods since March 2020 on public health grounds and that during periods when apprenticeship classes were permitted, they were running at half capacity under social distancing measures.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed and comprehensive emergency plan to tackle apprenticeship waiting lists has been under way across further education and training since August 2021, when some training facilities started to reopen.  At that point, 11,859 apprentices were delayed in their training.  Since then, a &euro;20 million additional capital investment has provided a large increase in workshops and equipment in every training location in the country.

A great amount of work has been done, a very small percentage of people have gone back to further education through the colleges, and their lives have changed dramatically because of that.  We as a society need to be very mindful of that.  We must also challenge all of Government - this Department and others - to ensure we are looking towards the people who are not engaging with further education, how we can make it more accessible, and how we can devise a programme and strategies that will ensure the best possible outcomes for people with learning difficulties and every kind of challenge who are on the margins of society.  The Minister needs to focus on that.<\/p>  <p>  On the submissions, is the Minister still taking submissions on this strategy or has this process closed at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800036#KK01200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1644346500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The submissions process has formally closed but it is never too late to submit a good idea.

One of the things a group or stakeholder driving the strategy said was that there needed to be additional priority groups.<\/p> <p>As I was saying in my response to Deputy Bacik earlier, we have made good progress on a number of category groups.  There are more students with a disability in higher education than ever.  However, that masks another reality.  We are not measuring all disabilities, so we expect additional priority groups.<\/p> <p> On the outcomes piece, that is exactly it.  We cannot just say, and this came from the feedback and the consultation, that it is great a student with a disability got into college.  Of course it is, but that is the student's right.  What we need to do is see what the student's college experience is like.  That brings me to the Deputy's next point, because the plan will require joined-up thinking, including with the Department of Education on the transition planning between second level and third level and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on what happens in terms of job opportunities afterwards.<\/p> <p> On the point about further education and training being the Cinderella of education, from a capital point of view that has been correct, but the Deputy can expect a significant uplift in capital funding in a new capital call.

In addition, on the disability side, it is necessary to ensure there are outcomes for them there.  There is a fundamental attitude across society that has to change.  While the Minister says the figures have increased, it is from a very low base.  We must be able to say that everybody has a role to play in society.

I passionately believe we have to reduce the cost of education.  We have already taken a number of steps since the Government took office just under two years ago.  I will not go through them all in the time available.  There is the first increase in the SUSI grants.  I accept that some of them do not take effect until September, but some of them have taken effect this year.  There have been increases in the student assistance fund, and the Deputy and I have engaged on this.  Indeed, the Government will consider the cost of living in the round at a Cabinet committee later this week.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am conscious that when we talk about a sustainable funding model for higher education it cannot be just a model that is sustainable for the institutions, although that is very important.  When I consider what a sustainable model would look like, I think of it as having three parts.  It looks at the level of investment we need to put into higher education now and into the future to ensure it can meet the needs of our society and some of the issues the Deputy and I were discussing earlier, and how we can know it is adequately and sustainably funded.  The second issue is how the grants system can be completely overhauled.  We have a SUSI review to go alongside that.  The third is the cost of education.  I believe we need to do work with regard to the registration fee.  The factual answer, as of now, is that I updated the Cabinet committee in December.  I am engaging bilaterally with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and I will shortly bring forward proposals on what that sustainable funding model looks like.  I must say again that we have ruled out student loans.  That is very important.  I do not believe it works; it is a failed model.  Students should not be leaving college heavily indebted and paying back the Government for loans, at a time when they might well want to be saving for other things in their lives in terms of progression.<\/p>  <p>  We have made a number of changes to the SUSI scheme.  There have been changes that have taken effect, including in respect of postgraduate students.  There are more to come in September.

That is worth saying whilst trying to improve them.  More than 65,000 students not only do not pay the highest tuition fee in Europe but pay either no tuition fee or a significantly reduced rate of fees.  These costs are covered by my Department through the SUSI scheme.

As Minister, I am asked how many extra college places will be created, which is important, and more places will be created.  The more important question, as raised by Deputies Gannon and Conway-Walsh, is how to provide these places in targeted areas where we need more people.  We are working with the institutions and my colleague, the Minister for Health, to see if we can provide additional college places, particularly in the health service area, and whether it can then provide additional training places.  Of course, for every additional nurse or doctor place, a training placement is required also.<\/p>  <p>  We are very actively engaging with the Department of Health, as we have been for some time, on determining the longer-term skills needs of the healthcare services and the role the further and higher education sector can play in meeting those skills needs.

We also have the figures for midwifery.  Could we look at improving access via this route of QQI level 5 courses?

All of us, including me, regularly tell students about the options and pathways that further education has.  It is true those pathways are not as developed as they need to be for nursing.  I will not name the institutions in this House but I have been in parts of the country where the college of further education is in one place, You can see through its windows the university or institute of technology, and the venue for pre-nursing and-or the university degree is adjacent but there is no pathway in place.  One of the conversations I am having is, instead of having a global figure of increase this year, whether we can ring-fence some of those places to increase pathways from further education.<\/p>  <p>  It always happens, regardless of points, that some people who would make a very good nurse or midwife go the further education and training route.

I had a chance to engage with students about some of their pathways and options after school and to see the new and exciting plan for Carrigtwohill Community College.<\/p>  <p>  I, along with everybody in the House, am highly conscious of the rising cost of living and how we must work together to ensure cost is not barrier in education.  Costs in education can come in many forms, as the Deputy correctly suggests in his question, including as a student contribution charge.  There can also be costs for accommodation and living away from home as well as for books and supplies.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that student contributions are a significant cost for those who pay them.  It is worth stating, nonetheless, that more than 65,000 students in higher education and their families receive support from SUSI and either pay no contribution or a reduced contribution level.  I would like to see that number increase, and that is why in the budget we voted to increase the income threshold so more families would not have to pay the contribution fee and would be eligible for the maintenance grant.  It is also why we have put in place measures to increase the SUSI grant by &euro;200 across the board from September.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically on the question of adjacency, we have decreased the distance very significantly from 45 km to 30 km.  It is an important move and we must do even more on that.  More students and their families will now qualify for the higher rate of grant as well.<\/p>  <p>  I have already said in this House, and I will do so again, that as we work on a sustainable funding model for education, it cannot just be about how we better fund institutions.  It must also be about how we can better support students and their families with costs.  I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and all of the Government in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of student accommodation, we changed the law not just once but twice last year to ensure no student could be asked to pay more than one month's rent and deposit.  Students were being asked to pay a lot upfront, such as four, five or six months of rent.  That was not on.  We also changed the law to ensure a student in student accommodation only had to give 28 days' notice because many students were losing money if, for whatever reason, they needed to return home.  We want to build on this in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800038#MM02200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1644347700,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and acknowledge the work done by him and the Minister of State in the area, especially with regard to travel distance.

We are trying to start a conversation by recognising that not every student is 18 or 19 years of age, and not every student wants the traditional full college experience.  More and more we are going to see students in full-time employment, with dependants, with a job or with a mortgage, who will need to access part of the education system.  This is where the hybrid model becomes very attractive, or indeed the remote learning option.  We introduced a range of emergency measures during Covid across education to keep the show on the road.  We now want to sit down with education stakeholders to see what good learning can be had from that, that we want to see embedded in the education system.

The Government has increased the number of places in higher education by approximately 6,000 over the past two years.  Obviously, that is a global figure.  I would also make the point, which might be somewhat reassuring or informative to leaving certificate students this year, that, as of the CAO deadline last week, the number of students who had applied to the CAO relative to the same time last year was down by 1,141.  We will have to see how this plays out in the weeks ahead, but there is a slight decrease this year in the number of students applying through the CAO compared with last year.<\/p>  <p>  We have made a number of significant increases in the overall places, and we have made targeted increases in specific places, including nursing and midwifery, where places have grown by 325 over the past two years.  The Government, the Minister of State and I are very conscious of the need to do more.  This is why we are working very closely with the Minister for Health and the Department of Health to identify if our sector is in a position to provide further places is the HSE and the Department of Health in a position to provide matching training places.  As Deputy Moynihan will be aware, when it comes to healthcare studies the college place is one part, but often the more important component can be the hospital training place.  I expect very good progress on that, and I acknowledge the very close working relationship with the Minister for Health in respect of it.<\/p>  <p>  While the initial CAO deadline was last week, we will find out the breakdown of courses, exactly how many people actually applied for the courses, and types of course, in March when the deadlines for higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, applicants also passes.

I will revert to Deputy Moynihan on that.  If there is a willingness and a desire to do more locally, then I am very happy to work with the Deputy to deliver on that.  I imagine that we could certainly do that.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question is, truthfully, trickier.  We have dealt with it a couple of times in the House this evening.

That figure will grow further.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot give the Deputy a commitment on the record of the House until I can be sure that I can deliver on it.  I can tell the Deputy that it is an absolute focus of my Department in our conversations with the universities that we do not just look for an increase in the global figure when it comes to nursing and midwifery, as relevant to this question.  We also look to see how we can grow the number of places that they set aside from that additionality for the further education and training pathway.  I am very confident that we can and will be continuing to expand the number of students we will be taking into our PLC courses for nursing.  We are investing record amounts there, but quite frankly I believe that we can do even more on that with the budgets we have and the facilities we have.

Expanding apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy has widened its impact in areas of skills shortage such as engineering, technology skills, logistics and fintech.  Under the plan there will be an increase in the online visibility of apprenticeship engagement and apprenticeship development processes for employers and sectors that wish to assess the potential of new apprenticeship development.<\/p>  <p>  The development of new apprenticeships is employer-led, with consortia comprising employer groups and educational providers coming together to identify a skills need and appropriate apprenticeship responses in a sector.  It is open to any industry that wishes to explore such options to bring forward a proposal.  Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing all employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 62 apprenticeship programmes on offer, comprising 25 craft programmes and 37 programmes which have been introduced since 2016.  Eight new programmes were launched in 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic: arboriculture; equipment systems engineer; healthcare assistant; principal engineer; professional doctorate; recruitment executive; sales; scaffolding; and supply chain associate.  A further three programmes are close to launch, namely, wind turbine maintenance, bar manager, transport operations and commercial driving.  There are 17 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics.  A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.  <\/p>  <p>  To meet our targets, we require an apprenticeship system that is flexible and responsive and provides a strong value proposition for employers and potential apprentices.  It must be attractive and easy to engage with and deliver high standards and sought after qualifications, therefore embedding apprenticeship as a preferred route to skills development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800040#OO00400","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1644348900,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Not too long ago, I visited DCU's school of education and had a very interesting engagement with Professor Anne Looney and others on this and on how one teaches the teacher of the future in order that he or she can in turn pass on that learning and the new ways of learning mathematics and science subjects and technology in general.

Cork County Council had refused planning permission, as had the board's inspector.  The council's response was an adamant and definite refusal.  The council's planner said that the plans would \"materially contravene the stated Objectives of the Cork County development plan\" and \"provide for a highly intrusive visually domineering form of development that debases the integrity and the landscape character\".  The council was very adamant.  These towers, whose tip height would reach 178 m, would dominate the landscape in the area.  It is acknowledged that alternative energy sources are need and that wind energy is going to form part of that.  A great many wind farms have already been built across County Cork, including seven locally, but this is a question of the suitability of the Gougane Barra area.  You cannot make another Gougane Barra but you can find other locations for a wind farm.<\/p>  <p>  When you think of Gougane Barra, you think of the secluded valley, the tiny oratory on the big tranquil island and the tall cliffs around it.  It is an isolated lost valley.  There is a real opportunity to develop the whole area, right the way down the Lee Valley from Gougane Barra, through the Gearagh and on to Blarney Castle, for tourism.  An awful lot of people rediscovered the area during the pandemic but Gougane Barra had already established its identity, nationally and internationally, well before then.  We want to see tourism developed in the area.  When An Bord Plean&aacute;la examined this application, it would have looked at F&aacute;ilte Ireland studies from 2007 and 2012.  Even with those, it was not satisfied.  It would have had to supplement them with studies from Scotland because the others were from so far back.  How much consideration was given to tourism when this decision was being arrived at?  <\/p>  <p>  The proposed development on the southern slopes of Derreendonee in Curraglass are right on the rim of Gougane Barra.  If you imagine Gougane Barra like a horseshoe with the lake in the middle, these towers would be on the far side of the cliff, on the southern side as you approach from the Wild Atlantic Way from the Bantry direction.  To put the 178 m height of these towers in context, the spire in Dublin is only 120 m tall.  Liberty Hall is 59 m tall.  These towers would be as tall as Liberty Hall with the spire on top of it.  Towers of that height situated 300 m above sea level would be seen from a very long distance away.  They would have a very significant impact.<\/p>  <p>  The local community is very much against it.  Coiste Forbartha B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha'n Ghaorthaidh is now faced with having to put together funds to possibly take on a judicial review.  The council has identified Gougane Barra and only a handful of other places in the county as tourist attractions of special quality.  These include the likes of Garnish Island, Blarney Castle and Gougane Barra.  This development would stand out like a sore thumb.  What consideration was given to the tourism value of the area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800043#RR00500","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speech","time":1644350700,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Aindrias Moynihan for raising this matter, which is very important to his community.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's role in relation to the planning system is primarily to provide a policy and legislative framework under which the planning authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Office of the Planning Regulator perform their statutory planning functions.  The legislative framework chiefly comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  The Department has also issued planning guidelines under section 28 of the 2000 Act that planning authorities and the board are obliged to have regard to in the exercise of their planning functions.  However, the day-to-day operation of the planning system is a matter for the planning authorities, and for the board where planning appeals or strategic infrastructure development are involved.<\/p>  <p>  In making decisions on a planning application, a planning authority or the board, as appropriate, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.  Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is specifically precluded from exercising power or control with regard to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is, or may be, concerned.<\/p> <p>Consequently, it would not be appropriate for me to comment regarding any individual planning case or cases. <\/p> <p> It is important to be aware, however, that Ireland has set an increased goal under our revised climate action plan for the generation of up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by the end of the decade.  An electricity grid powered by renewable energy sources will contribute to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets by substituting primarily wind and solar electricity generation for fossil fuel electricity generation, as well as displacing emissions in other sectors, for example, through the electrification of car transport and residential heating.<\/p> <p>  The renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, is Ireland's flagship policy to deliver on this up-to-80% target and to set a pathway to a net-zero economy.  The first RESS auction for onshore wind and solar projects was held in 2020.  The second RESS auction process has begun, with the qualification application window having closed in January.  The auction is scheduled to take place in May and the final notice of award in June, which is three months ahead of our previous plans.  It is anticipated that RESS 2 will deliver a major increase in renewable electricity generation by the end of 2024.  The RESS programmes, including the launch of the second onshore auction and the forthcoming offshore auctions, are a major step forward in meeting the Government's ambition of reducing emissions by 51% by 2030 and delivering up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030.<\/p> <p> A cornerstone of the RESS is the provision of pathways for increased community ownership of, participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects.  To facilitate delivery of this objective, an enabling framework for community participation has been developed.  This framework includes a preference category for community projects to ensure a route to market for communities; a community benefit fund for all projects to ensure that benefits are distributed to the local communities hosting these projects; and a suite of supports, such as information toolkits, trusted intermediary advisers and financial grants, to help communities to develop their own generation projects.  Furthermore, a supportive spatial planning framework for onshore renewable electricity generation development is critical to ensure delivery of the electricity targets set out in the climate action plan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800043#RR00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644351300,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Almost all the Minister of State's response focused on the need for energy and climate action requirements.  There is widespread recognition of that aspect from locals and the planning authority in this case.  There are, however, places that are more suitable for different uses.  It must surely be recognised that tourism is to be considered in this context as well.  Gougane Barra has to be regarded as a stand-out area for tourism.  Just because a national policy is in place to approve wind farms, that does not mean that every application submitted, even in unsuitable locations, must be encouraged as sites for wind farms.  Gougane Barra must surely be recognised as being more suitable for tourism.  The county council was adamant about this point and even An Bord Plean&aacute;la's own inspector recognised this.  It is not possible to make another Gougane Barra.  It is not an option available.

In the context of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, after almost two difficult years, it is appropriate that we should focus on the issue of the Irish diaspora.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to the House.  I wish him a renewed vigour in the context of his work now, considering he probably was not engaged in the type of travel over the past two years that he might otherwise have been in his role.  I wish him a successful and busy year in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the election of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the USA brought a renewed focus on the special relationship between Ireland and America.  The history between our two countries is rich and enduring.  First and foremost, it is a people-to-people relationship.  It is also complemented, however, by deep political ties and a vibrant political relationship from local authority level, here and in the US, right up to the White House.  Over the years, millions of Irish people emigrated to the USA.  They eked out livelihoods there and built homes.  More than 10% of the population of the USA, almost 33 million people, claims to be of Irish descent.  Pre-Covid-19, more than 1.5 million people visited Ireland annually from the United States for tourism and business or to visit relatives.  The strong people-to-people contacts I mentioned are also accompanied by dynamic economic and social contacts.  Some 800 US firms across Ireland directly employ 180,000 people.  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, ACCI, states that another 140,000 are indirectly employed.  Equally, more than &euro;3 billion annually is added to the Irish Exchequer in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, what I want to discuss with the Minister of State and ask him to examine are the possible elements of an enhanced package of measures on immigration, which I trust he would examine in conjunction with his Government colleagues.  I refer to a new programme, or an extension of existing programmes, to those who wish to live, perhaps work or even retire to Ireland.  It would be targeted specifically at US citizens.  I am calling for a package of measures for those demonstrating real and close ties to Ireland.  They might be joined by a spouse or partner.  <\/p>  <p>  There would, of course, be conditions.  The people concerned would have to be of good character.  There would also be certain income criteria to be met.  Equally, there would be a pathway to citizenship after several years.  Let us look at the success, for example, of the various schemes which run for a shorter time, such as the Fulbright programme.  What I would like to see is a bespoke residency scheme for US nationals.  The programme would be US-specific and not available for the nationals of any other country.<\/p> <p>It would of course have to comply with EU law.  It would require amendments to our employment work permit schemes.  We are going to be doing that in any event having regard to the shortage.  I ask the Minister of State to give this appropriate consideration.  Perhaps between now and the summer we can see how best we can enhance and develop that really important relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800044#SS00500","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644351900,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this topic and I pay tribute to the work which he undertook, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and as Minister for Justice and Equality, in regard to facilitating a whole-of-government response to issues affecting the Irish abroad, whether in the context of recent emigrants or the broader diaspora issues he is raising this evening, particularly with regard to those seeking to return to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's new five-year diaspora strategy, which I had the honour to launch in November 2020, owes much to the vision and strategic thinking underlying his work.  A key pillar of that strategy is our people.  This includes our goal to \"empower vibrant Diaspora communities that are connected to each other and to Ireland\" and the related commitment to be a voice for Irish citizens who wish to find pathways to legal migration, especially the undocumented in the US.  The proposal which the Deputy has raised this evening touches on both of those areas.  Under the existing scheme, which was developed by the Department of Justice under the Deputy's direction, the financial threshold for American citizens looking to take up residency in Ireland was set at &euro;50,000 per person per annum, in addition to proof that they would have access to sufficient funds to cover any unforeseen major expenses.  To a large extent, this adjustment of the threshold has meant that the majority of Irish Americans without Irish citizenship who are looking to retire to Ireland are in a much better position to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The reciprocal agreements that we have with the US in regard to taxation and social security are another important aspect that needs to be borne in mind.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I am supportive of looking at how that scheme has operated to see whether additional modifications could appropriately be made to improve it further.  I agree with the Deputy that there is particular scope to look at how we improve the provision of relevant information and communication in countries such as the US that are home to significant Irish diaspora communities about these opportunities, whether this relates to retiring to Ireland, returning here to set up a business, which is a programme for which we have doubled the funding this year - it is a very successful programme and we are hoping for even more success out of it this year - or to students travelling under the working holiday authorisation.<\/p>  <p>  Irish America - comprising those who are Irish born, those who claim Irish ancestry and those with a strong affinity for Ireland - is of tremendous importance to Ireland.  As the Deputy knows, we work closely with grassroots organisations and community groups right across America in support of Irish citizens.  In 2021, my Department provided more than &euro;4.22 million from the Government's emigrant support fund to support diaspora organisations in the US.  This represents one third of our total expenditure on emigrant support.  I had the opportunity to be in New York to announce some of that funding.  Our relationship with our diaspora and emigrants in the US, as the Deputy said, is greatly important.  The Deputy mentioned Covid.  A dedicated Covid response fund was also set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are most vulnerable, including the undocumented.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have also expanded and reinforced our network of diplomatic missions across the US, including opening a new consulate general in Los Angeles in 2018.  We will be opening a new consulate general in Miami this summer. We have established Ireland House operations in New York, Austin and San Francisco to provide for a team Ireland footprint.  This includes not just our diplomatic but our economic State agencies.  We have also worked closely with Culture Ireland to deepen our cultural ties by appointing dedicated cultural officers in the consulates in New York and Los Angeles.<\/p>  <p>  Returning Irish emigrants or those of Irish heritage bring with them skills and knowledge gained abroad that help develop both the national and local economies.  They help maintain and strengthen bonds between the Irish at home and abroad.  Thankfully, as we move away from the restrictions, we will have a greater opportunity to engage with our diaspora.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800045#TT00200","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1644351900,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the very positive nature of his reply.

There is a need for that recognition that the Deputy talked about that it is very much a two-way street.  We must deepen and strengthen ties with our diaspora but we must also be willing and open to bringing our diaspora back and to recognising that there is a large percentage of people who want to come to Ireland for many reasons, to study, work or live, who are part of that diaspora.

It is critical for that in terms of the new diaspora strategy that I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, that is all about recognising the deepening of our ties, reaching out to elements of the diaspora that we have not engaged with in the past and particularly that facilitation of people, be they Irish born or part of our greater affinity diaspora, who want to engage with Ireland in terms of being able to come here and experience what Ireland is all about.

I acknowledge that there is unanimity among the Deputies and I appreciate the passion with which they speak and the necessity for their constituents.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been seeking to acquire a site for a primary care centre at Collinstown Park Community College.  This school site is in the ownership of the Minister for Education.  Discussions have taken place with the HSE regarding the disposal of part of the site to the HSE for the development of the primary care centre.  Discussions between the HSE and Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education Training Board, DDLETB, have been ongoing for a number of years and, more recently, with my Department.  The initial proposal developed from an engagement between DDLETB, the school and the HSE was that the HSE would construct a facility adjoining the primary care centre for the use of the school.  The site for this development is separated from the main school building by an internal access road.  Initially, this facility was intended to be a library, but it then evolved into a multifunctional space that could be subdivided, if required.<\/p>  <p>  Following a review of the proposal by my Department in consultation with the HSE and ETB, it was determined that the provision of additional facilities for the school that adjoined the main school building would be more effective and provide a value-for-money solution.  The Department of Education has engaged with the HSE and the ETB concerning the delivery of the facilities at their revised location adjoining the school as part of the disposal agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Following further engagement with the HSE and ETB, I am pleased that it has now been decided that the disposal of the site for the primary care centre will proceed separate from delivery of the facilities to the school.  This is a significant positive.  My Department will proceed to progress the disposal of the site to the HSE in line with the protocols for the disposal of sites between State bodies and subject to the sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education is in discussions with the ETB regarding the provision of additional facilities for the school.  The ETB will be submitting an application for the proposed additional facilities shortly and this application will be processed promptly upon receipt.  It is anticipated that the Department will be in a position to advise the school and HSE of the outcome of this engagement with the ETB soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800046#UU00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1644352500,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It is always good to get positive news, even if it is only half of the way.  That the transfer to the HSE will proceed is welcome.  I invite the Minister to go a step further and try to give the four Deputies present an indicative timeline for the transfer and indicate whether she anticipates a speedy approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Crucially, if we had a notional timeline for when the transfer would take place, that would keep all of us content this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800046#UU00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1644352500,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I welcome that the disposal of the site for the development of a primary care centre in Collinstown will proceed.

It still does not give clarity as to when this will happen.  We could have been discussing this matter five years ago and the same answer might have been given.  I am slightly concerned about the ambiguous nature of the Minister's response.  At the end of the day, the people who will benefit are the people of north Clondalkin, who badly need this centre.  I suspect that, if this were to happen in a more affluent area of Dublin, there would be a different response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800046#UU00900","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1644352500,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I wish to be clear, as there is no ambiguity in this.  To be fair, I have had a short amount of time to move this project along.  It is a progressive and positive step, and should be acknowledged as such, that the disposal of the site for the development of the primary care centre will proceed separately from the delivery of facilities to the school.  This means that there is now the impetus for that project to move ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate how the timeline is an issue for the Deputies' constituents.  The Department will proceed to finalise the head of terms with the HSE for the disposal of the site.  The Department will also obtain the necessary sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal of the property.  As with all property disposals, due diligence is required, which the Deputies will appreciate.  This can give rise to added complexities.  Therefore, it is not possible to give a definitive timeframe.  However, the Department can provide the HSE with the necessary licences to enable it to commence development work on the site pending completion of the sale.  That is fair progress.  In tandem with that, my Department will process the application from the ETB for additional facilities for the school.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputies that officials in my Department will endeavour to progress and expedite both matters as quickly as possible.  This is significant progress for both projects, which are of particular significance to the Deputies' constituents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022020800046#UU01000","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1644352500,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ag 8.20 p.m. go dt&iacute; 9.12 a.m., D&eacute; C&eacute;adaoin, an 2 Feabhra 2022.\r\n\r\nThe D&aacute;il adjourned at at 8.20 p.m. until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 February 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
