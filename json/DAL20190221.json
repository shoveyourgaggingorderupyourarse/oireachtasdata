Under the scheme, the profits or gains accruing to a writer, composer, visual artist or sculptor from the publication, production or sale of his or her work is exempt from income tax.  Under section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Arts Council and the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht drew up guidelines for determining whether a work within specified categories is an original and creative work and whether it has, or is generally recognised as having, cultural or artistic merit.  On receipt of an application for the artists tax exemption scheme, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is empowered to make a determination that a certain artistic work is both original and creative and has, or is generally recognised as having, either cultural or artistic merit.  A work shall be regarded as original and creative only if it is a unique work of creative quality brought into existence by the exercise of its creator&rsquo;s imagination.  A work shall be regarded as having cultural merit only if by reason of its quality of form or content or both it enhances to a significant degree one or more aspects of national or international culture.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination only in respect of artistic works in the following categories: a book or other writing, a play, a musical composition, sculpture; or a painting or other like picture.  Where a determination is not made, in effect, the application is rejected.  There is a right of appeal to an independent appeal body in the event that Revenue declines to issue a determination.  The exemption only applies to income taxes and does not extend to VAT.  The maximum amount of income exempted from tax is &euro;50,000 per annum.  The names of recipients of the artists exemption together with the art work for which the relief is claimed are published on the Revenue Commissioners website.  I wish to advise the Deputy that although I have not discussed the expansion of the exemption with the Minister for Finance, these matters are kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100003#A00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1550745000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is welcome that the matter is kept under review because, as the Minister is aware, the arts have expanded in terms of the mediums and forms in which art is created.  We now have sound, multimedia and performing artists and it is very important that the scheme is updated to take account of contemporary art practice.<\/p>  <p>  A recent review of pay and conditions by Theatre Forum found that low pay, poor conditions and precarious work for the performing arts are having a serious impact on artists and arts workers.  Some of the statistics it uncovered are frightening.  Some 30% of performing artists earned less than the minimum wage in 2018.  Some 83% are paid flat fees rather than for hours worked.  Some 53% of art organisations do not have a pension or personal retirement savings account arrangement for their staff, while four fifths of jobs in performing arts are precarious.  Artists working through various mediums have raised the issue of working conditions with me.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept that the artists tax exemption is a complicated area on which the Minister must work closely with the Minister for Finance, but it may be one avenue which could be used to address these issues.  Culture 2025 committed the Government to a critical analysis of direct and indirect supports funding arts and cultural activities and to improve funding structures through multi-annual and cross-stream funding and investment in regional and local services.

My Department received a 13% increase in funding in the Estimates for this year.  There has been a &euro;6.8 million or 10% increase in funding for the Arts Council, while &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht has been allocated over the ten years to 2028 as part of the national development plan.

It is stark and frightening that some artists are unable to afford certain basic services such as rent, childcare and healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  Global Ireland 2025 committed the Government to implementing a range of further measures internationally, including the promotion of Irish arts, heritage and culture to new generations and audiences across the world.  One of the key issues raised by the representatives of Theatre Forum in January is the position of Irish artists in Ireland compared to the esteem in which they are held when they represent Ireland abroad.  This is a valid issue.  When artists attend embassies or go abroad, they are held in high esteem, but the reality when they come home is that many cannot afford rent, childcare or healthcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100003#A00800","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1550745600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I do not believe Fianna F&aacute;il is in a position to lecture this Government on the funding of the arts or artists' pay and conditions.

The most recent guidance of the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations, which I published on 8 January, highlighted the fact that the decade of centenaries created unprecedented opportunities for people of all ages to consider and explore some of the most significant events and themes in the history of modem Ireland.  The group recommended that this positive engagement and the associated tangible, long-term benefits continue to be supported beyond the conclusion of the decade in 2023 and that State support be considered for specific, significant decade of centenaries permanent legacy initiatives.  This is a view that I very much share.<\/p><p>One such legacy initiative is Beyond 2022: Ireland's Virtual Record Treasury, which the expert advisory group has endorsed as a potentially very significant and lasting decade of centenaries legacy initiative, combining historical research, archival conservation, technical innovation and international collaboration.  This project seeks to reimagine and recreate, through virtual reality, the Public Record Office of Ireland and its archival collections, which the Deputy may know were destroyed on 30 June 1922 in the opening engagement of the Civil War.  It is recognised that, while incomparable with the loss of human life, this cultural loss was one of the great tragedies of the Civil War.

In its second statement of principles, published in October 2017, the advisory group expressed the strong view that &quot;the opportunity to encourage scholarship at national and local level must be used as fully as possible, with particular emphasis on archival investment and development.&quot;  This significant capital investment will ensure that our cultural institutions and archives will continue to have a central role in continuing the process of broad public engagement, creating an important, tangible legacy that endures well beyond the decade of centenaries for generations to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100004#B00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1550745600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I understand the need for digitisation.

As the Deputy will be aware, this is a very complex and sensitive area.

Obviously the period between 1916 and 1923 was very turbulent throughout the country but particularly in Wexford.  In 1916, Wexford rebels took Enniscorthy town during the Easter Rising and subsequently Wexford was very active in the War of Independence and the Civil War.  During the War of Independence there were numerous attacks on Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, the Black and Tans were introduced and there were raids and counter raids.  It became quite vicious.  Many people in Wexford were imprisoned and often mistreated and tortured.  Many escaped from these prisons.  After the treaty was signed, the IRA in Wexford was very much split down the middle and Wexford was very heavily involved in the subsequent Civil War.  In their book, local historians Nicholas Furlong and John Hayes state the split between anti-treaty and pro-treaty adherents was countrywide but County Wexford became one of the most violent counties in the Civil War.  The conflict, which scarred and divided families, followed the pattern of guerrilla warfare.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister outline what the Department intends to do in terms of commemorating in County Wexford events from the War of Independence and the Civil War?

The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, seem to be on for it and I am really hopeful that we could engage.  Were the Minister in a position to give me the name of a person the groups could contact or to whom they could make their views known, that would be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100011#J01000","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550750400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1550750400,"counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100012#K00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1550750400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>As of today, we have 36 days to go before the Brexit deadline.  As if that was not enough worry for many of our farming and rural communities, this morning they woke up to a story on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>suggesting that rural communities and the beef sector in particular, will become the latest pawn in this Brexit debacle.  The <i>Irish Independent<\/i>has reported that the British Government is suggesting the introduction of a range of what it terms are tariff rate quotas to allow produce into the UK without tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The suggestion being picked up from a speech made by the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, is that those tariff rate quotas will be particularly attractive to countries like Brazil, with which we are in intense competition in the British market.  While we all know and accept there is no comparison between the quality of our beef and beef from countries such as Brazil, that will not make any difference on the supermarket shelves of Britain if their produce comes in on a tariff-free basis compared with ours.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste does not need to be told about the importance of the beef industry in Ireland.  Each year, &euro;2.5 billion worth of beef is exported, 52% of which goes to the UK.  That is &euro;1.25 billion worth of our economy currently in peril and awaiting clarity over the course of the next 36 days.  Leaving Brexit aside, the beef sector is under enormous pressure, and beef farmers are hugely angry and frustrated at what they see as inaction on the part of the Government to resolve the pressure they are under.  <\/p><p>Teagasc suggests that average incomes on cattle-rearing farms in 2018 is just over &euro;10,000 per annum.  Cattle prices are down in the beef sector by up to &euro;200 per head, year on year.  Thousands of farmers are turning out across the country in the hope of getting some sort of knowledge or indication from the Government that it understands where they are at, the pressure they are under and the importance of their sector to the Irish economy but they are not getting any signals of that understanding.  All they are seeing is a Government and a Minister that take the attitude that it will be all right on the night and will be fine but no practical measures are being taken to support them.  To add to that frustration, the remarks of the Taoiseach about cutting back on beef consumption did not help their case or situation.<\/p><p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on that story in the first instance.  Has he any knowledge, through his interactions on the Brexit issue, of Michael Gove's plans post 29 March?  What plans has the Government in place now to assist the Irish beef sector and to assist Irish farmers in the coming days and weeks to get extra supports from Europe to get through this particular challenge?  What work is being undertaken to deal with this threat to our sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100012#K00400","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1550750400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>First, I thank the Deputy for raising this hugely serious issue.  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I assure the Deputy that I and Deputy Creed and the Cabinet as a whole are more than aware of the potential threats to the agrifood industry and the beef sector in particular.<\/p><p>There are about 130,000 farm families in Ireland and about 100,000 of these get income from beef.  Some 60,000 to 70,000 get all of their farm income from beef.  When it comes to Irish agriculture in terms of numbers, beef is the most important issue and we are aware of that.  That is why the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has done a detailed assessment of what the impact a no-deal scenario could be in a worst-case scenario.  That is not a report that shies away from outlining the stress and pressure that this sector could be put under if it is not supported and managed by the Government and by the EU in that worst-case scenario.  As result, we have been speaking to the European Commission very directly and to the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan.  We have made it clear, and the Commission has made it clear that it will support us, that we can, if it comes to it, support and protect a sector to ensure it survives through a Brexit transition period.<\/p><p>We are, of course, all working to ensure that no-deal Brexit does not happen.  We have heard various rumours at different stages coming out of the UK.  At one point, I was being informed that the UK Government was going to look at having no tariffs at all.  Then we saw Michael Gove making announcements that he intends applying WTO tariffs on agrifood products.  On top of that, we are being told that within certain sectors like beef, they may look at tariff-free quotas for certain volumes of beef.  If they were to do that under WTO rules, they would not be able to apply a different tariff system or quota system to Ireland or to the EU, as they would to other parts of the world.  The only thing that would then differentiate Irish beef from beef from other parts of the world would be quality restrictions, which of course are a factor.  In of themselves, however, this will not be reassuring to Irish farmers, as we indeed see in the editorial of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>today.<\/p><p>The one thing I want to say on behalf of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is that we have been aware for many months of the vulnerability of agriculture.  That is why in the last budget, the beef sector was targeted in a positive way for more supports.  If it comes to it, the Government will not be found wanting to support and work with this sector through a very difficult period, should a no-deal Brexit materialise.  That will involve a significant amount of money and a relaxation of the state aid rules that would allow us to be able to support the vulnerable sectors through the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100012#K00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1550750400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The concept of the sector being under potential stress and pressure is ridiculous.  They are under stress and pressure as it is.  This statement from Mr. Gove this morning is adding to this stress and that pressure.  What has the Government done in the last number of years to get access to other markets to reduce our dependence on the UK market?  I put a question to the Minister, Deputy Creed, on lairage in Cherbourg and I got an answer back from him on Tuesday evening more or less shrugging his shoulders and stating that while there is an issue, it can be resolved privately.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be a lot more proactivity and involvement on the part of the Government in dealing with blockages in the system.  There needs to be a lot more proactivity on the Government's part in standing up to factories that are not paying decent prices.  We have the lowest cattle prices in the EU, far lower than in the UK, and meanwhile the Government is just shrugging its shoulders and hoping it will be all right on the night.<\/p>  <p>  President Juncker has said this morning that he is not very optimistic about a deal at the moment.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste has seen those remarks.  The Government needs to give certainty and clarity to farming families and not speak about stress and pressure as something that might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It is happening and is real.  If he wants to understand frustration I advise him to look at the minutes of the Oireachtas joint committee meeting on agriculture last Tuesday.  He should read the presentation that was given by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on beef and examine the reaction of members, including those from his own party, to the poorness of that presentation and the complete lack of understanding of the pressure the sector is under and, frankly, the lack of any plan to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100012#K00600","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1550750400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government understands only too well the pressures that the sector is under.  It has been a difficult year for beef on many levels.<\/p><p>Regardless of the question marks and frustrations that some people may have concerning factories, their interactions with farmers and so on - that is an ongoing and testing relationship, as it should be - something much more fundamental needs to be dealt with in the context of Brexit, and that is the issue on which we are focusing.  This is a Government that has always prioritised agriculture and farming and always will while my party is a part of it.  Given that we realised and focused on the vulnerabilities of the agriculture and farming sector at an early stage in the Brexit discussions, we will be prepared if necessary in the context of there being no deal.<\/p> <p> The Deputy asked for certainty and clarity, but one cannot provide absolute certainty if the other partner in the decision making - the UK - cannot provide it either.  We have always approached Brexit by necessity, having to adapt to decisions that are being made in Westminster.

We can all agree on that.  Every Deputy knows patients and families struggling to access appropriate care and help for themselves and their loved ones and children.  We are all aware of the inadequate staffing levels across CAMHS that make it impossible for the services to meet demand.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 2,560 children and young adults are on the CAMHS waiting list.  Those 2,560 are being failed.  Almost 300 of them have been waiting for more than a year to be seen.  These figures are shocking and unacceptable, and this situation needs to be addressed.  Early intervention is crucial, but early interventions in mental health cases are not possible when there are extensive waiting lists and a sheer lack of capacity within the system.  CAMHS is not meeting the needs of a large cohort of our children and young adults.  The situation has been this way for far too long.<\/p>  <p>  Children and young adults who are desperately in need of care and help and who are reaching out for same are not getting the appropriate support in a timely manner.  This is primarily due to the failure to recruit the staff needed to operate CAMHS teams.  Some services are operating on barely half the number of staff identified in A Vision for Change.  When that policy was launched, it was supposed to be a ten-year plan.  It is 12 years since it was launched, though, and it has ceased to have any real meaning because it has been left unimplemented for so long.<\/p>  <p>  In my area of CHO 1, which includes Cavan, Monaghan and the north west, there are ten vacant CAMHS posts and 240 children who are waiting to be seen.  This is not acceptable.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that, given that the situation in his area is even worse.  In CHO 4, which covers Cork and Kerry, 650 young people are on the waiting list, and more than 100 of them have been waiting for longer than a year to be seen and supported in respect of their mental health.  It is little wonder that this is the case in Cork and Kerry, given that CHO 4's staffing is at roughly 56% of the recommended level.  Approximately 74 CAMHS positions are vacant in Cork and Kerry.  This is shocking and confirms the serious lack of capacity in the system.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of our children, we cannot allow this situation to persist.  Where children or young persons need care and help, they cannot be forced to stay on an extended waiting list that puts them and their mental health at serious risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100013#L00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1550751000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Time is up, Deputy, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100013#L00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1550751000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I will finish on this.

I do not believe that anyone in this House, and certainly not on this side, would contest that.  However, it is an area into which we are putting many more resources.  In the budget, an extra &euro;55 million was assigned to mental health services, bringing the overall budget for 2019 to nearly &euro;1 billion.  It is not like financial resources are not being increased.  That said, it is not just about financial resources.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of CAMHS are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved access to age appropriate units.  In 2015, the executive introduced a new standard operating procedure for inpatient and community CAMHS.  This has contributed to improving services overall, including a reduction in inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units.  It is also designed to reduce CAMHS waiting lists, particularly for those waiting longer than a year.  Access is based on professional clinical assessment and urgent cases are seen as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, 114 new assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists were recruited to HSE primary care services to help relieve pressure on the specialist CAMHS.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, recently approved ten new advanced nurse practitioner posts to improve CAMHS.  On the policy front, work is ongoing to complete and refresh A Vision for Change and to produce a draft report, which will be completed shortly.  I do not have a draft timeframe, but I will try to get the timetable for the Deputy, as this is not the first time he has raised the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The key objective - it is the only objective, really - is to enhance services overall.  There is a recognition that we have had recruitment difficulties in this area.  We have provided more funding to address that and recruitment is happening.  It needs to continue to happen so that we provide consistent timelines across the country and there are no black spots where young children wait for far too long to get the support and care they need.  It is an ongoing process to improve those services by increasing funding and recruitment.

Even if we do not agree on the causes of the problems, I am sure the T&aacute;naiste agrees that Venezuela is not the only divided country with economic problems, but it is the only one in which there is an unelected, self-proclaimed President who has been recognised as a head of state without any basis in law, including by Ireland.  It is the only one which the US military is circling.  We believe it is landing in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Colombia under the guise of delivering humanitarian aid.  It is eerily like the weapons of mass destruction lie that was used to sell the Iraq war and it is happening on a continent where the provision of humanitarian aid has been used as cover for death squads by the same Elliot Abrams who is now at the head of the US operation in Venezuela.  This is incredibly serious.  One does not need to be a genius to work out that the humanitarian aid narrative is just a Trojan horse.  Even the official organisations, the International Red Cross and the United Nations, want to have nothing to do with it, as it is not aid but provocation.

Surely that is what a neutral country should be doing.  Anything less is a facilitation of the latest resources war.  We know that Venezuela has the largest oil resources in the world.  We know that because President Trump and John Bolton have told us that they are in discussions with American oil companies to take the oil from the Venezuelan people.  We know that they have wanted to do this for a long time.  We also know that they tried to overthrow Hugo Ch&aacute;vez and about the sanctions that followed, but this is a turning point.

We have spoken out and will continue to speak out against military intervention.  As the Deputy will be aware, the most recent EU 28 statement on Venezuela was delivered by the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, on 26 January.  It reiterated that \"a peaceful and inclusive democratic solution is the only sustainable way out\" of the crisis in Venezula which, by the way, is the worst political, social, economic and humanitarian crisis in its history.  Some 3 million refugees have left the country in the past three years and moved to neighbouring states.  It was clear that if no announcement on the holding of fresh elections was made by President Maduro in the days after that EU statement, the European Union would take further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country's interim leadership.  I have been strongly in favour of co-ordinated EU action on Venezuela and fully subscribe to the European Union's common position.  Far too often, the European Union speaks with multiple voices and, therefore, has no impact or effect.  Instead it allows other countries to have that impact and effect.<\/p>  <p>  On 3 February, in the absence of an announcement by President Maduro calling fresh elections in Venezuela, a number of EU member states began to issue statements recognising Juan Guaid&oacute; as interim President of Venezuela with responsibility to facilitate the holding of democratic elections and nothing else.  Not to take a decision lightly, I took a number of days to consider our position and on 6 February decided that Ireland should join the vast majority of its EU partners, including Spain, Croatia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Finland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Slovakia and France, all of which recognise the interim arrangements and support the call for free, fair and democratic elections.  They include neutral and independent countries, countries with socialist and EPP governments and so on.  There is a collective effort within the European Union to try to create pressure.  In our view, the only way to resolve the issue is by facilitating the holding of free and fair presidential elections which we have not seen in Venezuela for many years.  I join the other EU member states mentioned in acknowledging and supporting Juan Guaid&oacute; as interim President of the democratically elected national assembly to enable him to call free and fair democratic elections.  We share this position with 24 other EU member states, virtually every state in South America and many others in different parts of the world.  I cannot be neutral on the dramatic humanitarian crisis unfolding in Venezuela.  If any Member of the House have evidence to the contrary, I encourage him or her to share it.

The very mention of Brexit two years ago seems to have given factories across the country the right to cut the prices on cattle.  Prices have fallen by 20 cent to 25 cent per kilogram or in the region of &euro;100 per head.  This leaves many beef farmers unable to cover their costs and causes them to sell their cattle at a serious loss, which leads to huge stress in these family farms.<\/p>  <p>  Factory prices currently do not meet the costs of producing the cattle.  Some beef producers are also fattening some of their own cattle in their own feed lots.  It is estimated that up to 20% of finished cattle are coming from factory controlled units.  This is putting farmers in west Cork and throughout the State at a serious disadvantage.  Some factories were found to be underweighing the cattle, thus underpaying our farmers for their meat.  Little or nothing is done for the farmer in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  For a farmer to break even, he or she needs to be getting &euro;4.60 per kilogram but at the moment, the farmer is getting &euro;3.40 per kilogram.  Who is creaming off the farmers' back?  The T&aacute;naiste and I know who it is but nothing is done to stop this carry-on.  Factories are arrogant in this country and have been left arrogant by the Government as we stand idly by and see many farmers who have farmed for generations go out of business.  All we have to do is look across to the UK where farmers are getting &euro;150 per head more for their cattle than Irish farmers get.  How can this happen there and not here? Our farmers are putting out the best quality cattle and getting a shockingly poor return.  Here lies the crisis for our farmers to simply survive.<\/p>  <p>  The last budget was a great opportunity for Ireland to stand up for these farmers by giving them a &euro;200 suckler cow grant.  The Government, however, failed these farmers by only giving them &euro;40.  Many believe it would not be worth the trouble financially of weighing the cow and calf to just get &euro;40 in return.  The Government has had ample opportunity in the past three years to turn the fortunes of the beef farmer around but on the ground nothing has happened.  This morning we see a new crisis looming for farmers as reported in leading articles in national newspapers.  It looks like our friends in Britain are upping the ante in the battle over the Brexit backstop.  Their plan aims to allow beef-producing countries such as Brazil to dodge the brunt of new import taxes or tariffs after Brexit.  This will mean huge quantities of Brazilian beef being pushed into the UK market and quality Irish beef being priced out.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture and fisheries are two of the major industries in Ireland but at present, one senior Minister is responsible for both industries.  This may have worked in the past but now with a very serious Brexit looming, the situation has changed completely.  I see the crisis we are in and the bigger one facing us.  I have called for a senior Minister to be responsible for each of the two industries and I call for that again today.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and the Government see what Ireland sees and appoint a stand-alone Minister with responsibility for agriculture and food to fight to save the livelihood of thousands of farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100015#N00400","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1550752200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that I understand only too well the pressures of the beef sector.  I chaired a beef forum for a number of years and I know the personalities in the sector well on the factory side and on the farm side.  We have supported and will continue to support the beef sector through the rural development programme, where we have invested &euro;300 million in the current development programme to support the suckler sector.  Another &euro;20 million was announced in the last budget and another &euro;25 million was added to the area of natural constraint, ANC, payments, primarily focused on beef suckler farmers.  The Government has not and will not be found wanting in support for this sector, especially when there are pressures from outside, such as those decisions we do not control that are linked to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question, I do not believe it would make any sense for us to restructure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine right now, with regard to the fish sector.  There have been conversations and preparations under way for many months around Brexit and that Department has focused on the pressures and vulnerabilities for both fishermen and farmers.  The idea that we would go through some kind of restructure now with 36 days to go to a no-deal Brexit would not make any sense.  That is about as polite I can be about that.<\/p>  <p>  I have had the discussion with the Taoiseach and with others at different times on whether we should separate the fishing portfolio from agriculture.  Having thought about it I do not think we should.  It is the food sector and I believe that fishing in particular is enhanced in its representation around the Cabinet table by being linked to the broader food sector, especially when it comes to exports and Brexit, with the potential need for compensation packages and EU intervention in both sectors to ensure they can survive should we have a worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit.  Incidentally, I do not believe it will happen but if it did, we would need to be ready and we have a Department that is working night and day to put contingency plans in place should it come to that.  The idea that we would restructure and change our personalities at this late stage is not a decision we should be taking now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100015#N00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1550752200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Approximately 170,000 people are employed directly in the agrifood sector and 250,000 people employed indirectly in the wider rural areas in agrifood production.

We will be asking them for more co-operation next week on the legislation being published tomorrow.  I met Michel Barnier on Monday and received reports from the Juncker-May meeting yesterday.  Our position has been consistent for many months and will not change.  The backstop is a necessary guarantee to reassure people on this island that they will not face the re-emergence of border infrastructure between the two jurisdictions on this island as an unintended consequence of Brexit at any point in future.  That is also the EU's position, which is why it has said that it is not willing to reopen or renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.  The agreement is already a finely-balanced document involving compromises on both sides to achieve important outcomes, in particular from an Irish perspective.  The focus now is on how to give the House of Commons the reassurance it needs around the temporary nature of the backstop which will hopefully never be used but which needs to be in place unless and until it can be replaced by something more permanent which must do the same job the backstop has been designed to do.  That is where this issue of alternative arrangements comes in.  Alternative arrangements are already catered for in the existing withdrawal agreement and in the future relationship declaration.  If there are alternative arrangements that can replace the backstop, as long as they do the same job, they can, of course, be considered.

Section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides a list of traffic offences that CCTV evidence may be used for, for example, speeding.  It is not, however, possible to use evidence from these cameras to enforce the following offences: parking in bus lanes, which is prohibited under SI 182 of 1997, Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997; parking in cycle lanes, which is prohibited under SI 274 of 1998; driving in bus lanes, which is prohibited under section 32 of SI 182 of 1997; and driving in cycle lanes.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, these laws related to cycle and bus lanes are frequently violated and present a significant inconvenience to bus drivers, the people who use buses and to cyclists.  In the case of bus lanes, the presence of non-authorised vehicles slows down bus traffic and it takes longer for service users to get to their destination.  It can also result in bus drivers having to swerve unexpectedly to avoid them.  This presents a considerable challenge to bus drivers and clearly poses a safety risk to both car and bus users.  In the case of cycle lanes, the presence of vehicles also presents a significant risk as cyclists must swerve into traffic to avoid parked vehicles.  Ireland's cycling infrastructure is wholly inadequate as it is without it being rendered unusable by the presence of parked cars, skips and multiple other items being put in the way.  These are widespread issues.  I frequently take Dublin Bus.  One morning, I spotted at least 15 cars parked illegally in a bus or cycle lane in a relatively short distance between Portobello and College Green.<\/p><p>We need to drastically improve our detection of these traffic violations.  I believe that this could be done through the use of CCTV cameras to reinforce these new road traffic laws and increase detection of these offences.  For example, Dublin Bus vehicles could be fitted with CCTV cameras to detect violations of these laws.  This is already the case in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and many other jurisdictions.  Evidence from these jurisdictions suggests that this enforcement works.  In the borough of Gateshead in the United Kingdom, there was an initial surge in the number of fixed charge notices issued to motorists, which quickly fell by nearly a half.  It is evidence that as drivers became aware that they were taking risks by using the bus lane, they wanted to avoid a fine.<\/p><p>A report last week by INRIX, a global company which specialises in transport analytics, confirmed that Dublin is now the slowest city centre in all of Europe.

Many of us had raised all of those issues, including the issue of the potential for conflicts of interest arising from Dublin Airport being a source of revenue for the council.  The reality is that the Minister made this decision in haste.  I believe that is fair to say.  He left it too late.  All along he had been planning for the Irish Aviation Authority to be the competent authority.  When he realised it was not permitted to carry out that function because it failed the independence test, he then rushed to Fingal County Council, completely ignoring the concerns it raised, the same concerns which many of us had raised.  One has to ask again: how can Fingal County Council be truly independent in regulating an entity from which it receives an income?  That income is quite substantial.  The Minister may say that it is only 8% but 8% of a council's overall budget is pretty substantial.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has said that neither the Commission for Aviation Regulation nor Fingal County Council had the relevant expertise.

The amendments passed include provision for a review to take place of the performance by the regulator of its functions under this Bill.  The first such review must happen within seven years, and every five years thereafter.  That first seven-year period is necessary to ensure the regulator and the appeals body have one full regulatory cycle under their belts, so that the first review can look at all aspects of how the structures have worked, including the assessment process, the consultation, the decision-making, any appeal and the monitoring.  In practice, I expect the first review will happen sooner than this, but there is no point in forcing a review after three or five years and finding that it is too soon to provide a full picture of how things have worked and are working.  The outcome of the review would be formally reported on that report to be published.  If there are any matters of concern arising from the review, I would fully expect the Oireachtas committee to examine the matter further.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the amendments passed last week also provide that the regulator will produce an annual report detailing the work it has undertaken in the previous year and setting out its programme for the forthcoming year.  This will be entirely separate from and in addition to any annual report produced by the council with regard to its other work.<\/p>  <p>  I want to quickly come back to the matter of the references to health, which was an important debate.  As I said, this Bill must be read in tandem with Regulation (EU) 598\/2014 itself and with other related EU directives, including the environmental noise directive.  All of these apply to Fingal County Council as the new noise regulator.  I want to assure the House that in this Bill, as it is now drafted, whatever is decided at EU level in relation to the WHO guidelines will have full applicability to Fingal County Council, in its role as noise regulator.  I have tried to explain that Ireland cannot move unilaterally on that front, when giving effect simultaneously to Regulation (EU) 598\/2014 in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Going back to the matter in hand, amendments Nos. 51 and 90 to 92, inclusive, introduce a practical and workable complaints procedure.  In the first instance, under amendment No. 51, it would be a matter solely for the noise regulator to consider if there are grounds to review a noise assessment, where circumstances may have changed.  It also gives power for the regulator to direct the airport authority to provide it with any necessary information it requires to undertake such an assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Under amendment No. 91, a new subsection would be inserted into section 2, the section which relates to the regulator's monitoring powers.  Under this new provision, any person can make a complaint to the regulator and ask it to review the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures which are in place.  This provides for a mechanism by which a person with a genuine complaint has somewhere to go and be heard.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment Nos. 90 and 92 are consequential to amendment No. 91.  I note that my amendments have the effect of replacing Deputy Clare Daly's amendment on Committee Stage.  The intention of that amendment, however, is retained and expanded on.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, only the regulator can consider if there is good reason to open a regulatory decision in between the five-year regulatory cycle, but any person can complain to the regulator at any point and request an investigation into non-compliance with a regulatory decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100026#Y00350","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1550757900,"counter":356,"content":"<p>It is unfortunate the way this group of amendments have morphed a little bit and strayed.  When this Bill was first drafted there was no facility whatsoever for residents to make representations to the competent authority.  The Bill provided that the DAA could go to the competent authority and ask it to assess the situation.  The select committee agreed with my amendments on Committee Stage and put in a provision for residents to be able to do that.<\/p><p>However, there was another part to that, that the decision on whether or not to investigate a complaint rested solely with the competent authority, which would decide whether or not to conduct an assessment.  I do not have a particular problem with that.  There may be spurious complaints and we do not want the authority to have to go through a full investigation.  However, what I am merely providing for is that in the event that it decides not to carry out an assessment, it needs to inform the person in writing as to the reason for that.  The way the Department has drafted these amendments means there is no facility that bit to go in, unless it goes into the original text, which the Department has dramatically changed by splitting it into two parts.  I want to hear from the Minister that the bit about it being in writing will be resubmitted with amendments Nos. 90 and 91 in the Seanad to properly deal with this issue.  If it is not, we have a bigger problem, and I will come back to that.<\/p><p>On the matters the Minister spent most of his time dealing with, clearly the officials had time to write the speaking note to deal with some of the issues he was not able to deal with when they were raised on the floor of the House.  We have a substantial problem, as do the residents, with the perceived lack of independence of Fingal County Council being the competent authority.  The Minister's responses to us have not been adequate.  He got very blustered and <\/p><p>said that it was all history because when Fingal County Council's senior official wrote expressing these concerns, the Attorney General came back and said that there were no conflict of interest.  Therefore, the matter was over.  The Minister is, however, patently ignoring what the official said.  She did not just raise an issue of a conflict of interest.  She also raised the issue that Fingal County Council did not have the requisite competencies available of aviation operations noise and economic feasibility assessments and that another independent organisation would be better.  That was in November 2017.  On 30 January, the Minister announced Fingal County Council as the competent authority.  In terms of freedom of information, and conveniently the freedom of information officer is on holiday this week, so cannot clarify this, no records have emerged to date of any meetings between Fingal County Council and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to address those issues the Minister said were extensively discussed with the three candidates, the other two being the EPA and the Commission for Aviation Regulation Ireland, CAR.  Interestingly enough, there is no information under freedom of information about any intensive discussions with them either.<\/p><p>Can the Minister explain how, between November and his announcement in January, all these issues were addressed, particularly when we have correspondence under freedom of information where his senior official wrote back to Fingal County Council?  This was in May more than two weeks after he made the announcement about Fingal County Council.  It read:<\/p><blockquote>Hi AnnMarie <br \/><br \/>See the link below.  This issue about independence is likely to have prominence.<\/blockquote><p>The link was to a debate that took place in Fingal County Council, where the elected councillors expressed concern about the lack, or perceived lack, of independence of their council.  The official in the Minister's Department went on to say that the Minister was, of course, defending this robustly.  I have not seen much evidence of that but we will park that.  The letter stated, &quot;Any help you might be able to give around defensive points would be appreciated&quot;.  It further stated: &quot;For example, as a starting point, I do not know if the proportion of Fingal rates that is claimed by the DAA of 20% is correct.&quot;  If the senior official dealing with this issue, after the date the Minister announced Fingal County Council as the competent authority, did not know the level of rate base of Fingal County Council, and its reliance on the DAA, and the Minister does not think that is a problem, then I think there is something seriously wrong with him, to be honest about it.<\/p><p>It is a fundamental problem and shows that the points about Fingal County Council's independence have not been adequately addressed.  We do not have to rely on that correspondence alone.  We also have correspondence from the EU expressing its concerns about the issue of independence.  The Minister is saying that everything is okay and the issues have been addressed because the Attorney General said that there was not a conflict of interest.  Let us say that we accept that, but the Attorney General did not say that there would be a conflict of interest with the Commission for Aviation Regulation or the EPA either.  The conflict of interest issue is not the only consideration, as the competent authority also has to have expertise.<\/p> <p> We now have a major problem because of the manner in which this issue has been handled.  In that sense, the complaints procedure takes on even greater prominence.  When the Minister's own Government colleague and Chair of the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport asks questions about letters and this information not being brought before the committee, it is an unprecedented problem.  The manner of the Bill's handling in the House has been shambolic from start to finish.  In some ways, my heart goes out to the officials.  It is a difficult job, but we have tried to engage.  I recognise that we have made improvements to the Bill, but if the Minister believes he can shout and roar in the Chamber and say that there is no conflict of interest and that the Attorney General will address the issues we have raised, he is wrong.  Will he please address the issues that Deputies across the Opposition benches have raised about these points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100026#Y00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550758500,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Darragh O'Brien, whom I will be calling on in approximately a minute to adjourn the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100027#Z00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1550758500,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Clare Daly, in that the structure of the competent authority has not been clarified.

A great deal more work is needed on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, amendments were passed regarding the making of complaints.  It is good that we will have an authority to which residents can make a complaint, as that has been a major issue, with the DAA effectively being the only avenue open to people to date to make complaints.  Most of us would agree that the majority of complaints have not been heard fairly.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of complaints receiving written responses if the competent authority decided that a complaint was spurious or that it would not proceed with an investigation was the spirit of the Committee Stage debate.  My colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and I supported Deputy Clare Daly strongly on that amendment.  While we acknowledge that there will be somewhere to make a complaint to and that the competent authority will be able to decide whether there is enough in the complaint to take the matter a step further, we agreed on Committee Stage that, if the authority decided that it could not or would not proceed, a written explanation would be given.  That should be the bottom line.  We understand that spurious complaints can be made and, hence, we were not saying that the competent authority had to investigate every complaint, but if there is a reason for it being unable or unwilling to investigate, that needs to be explained to the complainant in writing.<\/p>  <p>  I support the request that, when the Bill is before the Seanad-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100027#Z00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1550758500,"counter":360,"content":"<p>We need a commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100027#Z00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1550758500,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Yes.

Much of the delay is probably inevitable, but arrangements should be made to deal with a number of issues which I believe the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, could address with some speed.  She is not present for the discussion, but she must bear in mind that we now know that there are approximately 150,000 adoption files held by Tusla, of which 50,000 or more are since adoption was legally introduced in Ireland in 1952.  I have been asking questions and campaigning on this issue for a long period and one of the problems is that in most cases many of the parents of the children are now deceased, while many of the children are much older.  The unfortunate part is that the Minister is continuing to cling to a social worker-led model when people just want to receive their information.  They want to receive information on the mother and baby homes, with their personal information and files.<\/p>  <p>  Since we last discussed this matter, the information on burials at Sean Ross Abbey has come to light, with suggestions the number of children buried there is far more significant than previously believed.  This is very distressing for all of the people connected with Sean Ross Abbey, but everybody was aware of the information.  Certainly, my mother used to say to me when I was a child that children had died like flies in these institutions.  They died from what are now treatable illnesses such as gastroenteritis.  They also died from a range of other illnesses which nowadays can still take babies' lives such as meningitis.  If there was an infection in a home, it appears that it spread like wildfire.  I welcome the Minister's decision to have excavations carried out at Sean Ross Abbey.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest mother and baby home in the Dublin area was St. Patrick's on the Navan Road.  I was always told and people connected with the home have repeatedly said approximately 2,000 babies are buried in the Holy Angels plot at Glasnevin Cemetery.  In fact, others have suggested the figure is higher.  In addition, many people living in Dublin at the time, particularly poorer people, who lost a baby buried him or her in the Holy Angels plot.  That issue must be addressed.  It is part of a very sad history in Ireland, but the people affected deserve to have it addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I have with me the reply I received from Tusla last June about the number of people who were seeking to trace their origins.  The numbers are extremely high, but, more importantly, where the process is still ongoing, the number amounts to many thousands.  Last year the Minister made a public announcement on the 126 files related to St. Patrick's Guild which ran a home on Temple Hill in Blackrock.  I am aware of many people from St. Patrick's Guild who have been approached with a letter from the Minister and Tusla offering social worker services.  People do not particularly need social worker services unless they ask for them.  They are adults.  The people referred to were born between the late 1940s and the late 1960s; therefore, almost everybody is well over 40 years old.  Some might need counselling and the help of a social worker, but more than anything they need information.<\/p>  <p>  My view is, given the way it is set up, Tusla will never be able to deal with more than 10% to 20% of the inquiries it faces.  Before Christmas we received the news that St. Patrick's Guild which was one of the biggest adoption societies in Ireland had gone into liquidation.  That means that almost 100 years of its history is gone.  I believe Tusla has the records, as the Minister can confirm, but the position is far from satisfactory.  I understand there were legal cases, some of which were in the public domain last year, and that the guild may have had to make legal redress to some of the people involved.<\/p>  <p>  What is the current position?  We are in the middle of a detailed mother and baby homes investigation which is being carried out by some eminent and trustworthy people, but the problem with the Government is that it is not prepared to expand its remit to address very important issues, some of which are relatively resolvable in the time that is left.  I refer, first, to Bethany Home.  After almost three years in office, the Government has not addressed the issues involved.  Almost every Member is aware that the people from Bethany Home are now mainly of considerably advanced years and deserve to be addressed in a fair way.  I ask the Minister of State to convey that message to her senior Minister colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  Second, with regard to St. Patrick's Guild and the files on the 126 people mentioned, I introduced a Bill to deal with informal, false and illegally registered adoptions.  It would provide people with a mechanism to approach the court to have their circumstances validated.  There are a number of people who were registered as the natural children of their adoptive parents.  I assume that the nun gave the happy parents the baby they were going to adopt and told them to register him or her.  They probably never knew that they were doing anything untoward, but there must have been arrangements which facilitated it.  An increasing number of cases came to my attention following publication of the Bill.  Ms Anne O'Meara is a barrister who was adopted and whose birth certificate turned out to be illegal.  She has spoken on the Sean O'Rourke radio programme and spoke at the launch of the Bill.  She is quite clear that she was adopted by a very loving family who brought her up, with her siblings.  However, when they were given her, they went and registered her as their natural born baby.  Therefore, her birth certificate is invalid.  In addition, she was born in Belfast.  As in most cases, her adoptive parents always told her that she had been adopted.  She was adopted in Belfast.  She must have a remedy whereby she can go to court to have her life validated as it has been lived, in other words, that she was adopted by her parents.  The registration of her birth was false and wrong and she needs a mechanism to resolve the issue.<\/p><p>I really plead with the Minister of State because I know she knows a lot about this issue, to get the Government to act on the legislation I have brought forward.<\/p> <p> Regarding St. Patrick's Guild, we are told there are another 746 cases that are of concern, to use the words of the Minister.  As St. Patrick's Guild is just one of many adoption societies, if one uses one's imagination one will know this affected many people.  I have dealt in recent days with a case of someone whose original birth certificate, when they obtained it, had been utterly falsified.  Again, there was something irregular about the birth certificate they got.  However, there is no remedy whatever available to this individual, and what is more, they do not even know how they should have registered their children in terms of their children's parentage and their own identity.<\/p> <p> There is a lot that could be done about this.  I stress that we can work together on this and with the various organisations which have been lobbying on this issue.  We can help people without having to say, as is inevitable, that they will have to wait three, five or seven years for a social worker.  That is just neither a practical nor a realistic solution.<\/p> <p> The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection handles vast amounts of people's data, as do other Departments, such as the Department of Health.  It is possible to have access to one's own data, and that is a human right, for information purposes.  It is proposed, however, to put up a roadblock and say all data must go through some social worker model.  The children who are young now and have difficulties are the people who need the social worker and the family support, whereas the Government just has to make a decision on the people who are more mature and want their information.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, was very vocal about this when she was a Senator.  She supported me on a lot of legislation which was socially very advanced for the Ireland of the time, such as legislation providing for marriages to be celebrated by civil solemnisers and humanists and, similarly, legislation providing for transgender people to be allowed a birth certificate in their required gender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100031#HH00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550761500,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100032#JJ00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1550761500,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Yes, I will.

Since then, we have had four interim reports: two in 2016, one in 2017 and one in 2018.  The final report was due on 17 February last, but now this extension has been asked for.  It further pushes out the process until February 2020.  We are told it is to ensure there will be an accurate and comprehensive final report but the whole history of this matter has been one of delay after delay over many years.  It is even a number of years now since the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, apologised to the ladies of the Magdalen laundries, who still face a number of outstanding issues.  This is all related: the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and the industrial schools.  It is the treatment of unmarried mothers that was inhumane.  This included treatment by their families, the fathers of the babies of those unmarried mothers, many people in the clergy and many people in officialdom.  They were not all unmarried mothers.  One of the saddest stories I heard was of a lady I met who had been put into an institution by her father because his second wife did not want the children from the first wife living with them after that first wife had passed away.  It is quite incredible to think Irish people could behave in such a cruel and inhumane way.<\/p>  <p>  I must mention the mixed-race people because I was very privileged to meet them and it is so good that they are involved.  Two of them are chairing particular groups.  Their stories are even more heartbreaking because of the additional pain, trauma and stigma they faced, being from a mixed-race background.  I found it a very humbling experience to meet them and others I have met in my time here.  They have survived with dignity and compassion, and I think we all benefit from that experience and from their insight.<\/p>  <p>  We know there are survivors who are extremely angry about the way they have been treated, and that anger must be acknowledged and respected.  Now, to add to the exasperation already being experienced, there is further delay to people getting information, as they found out through the media that an extension was being sought for another year.  Will the commission be looking for another extension this time next year?  Perhaps an extension is really needed in order that all the information be available, but surely it is just a matter of courtesy that those who are most affected, namely, the survivors, would hear first and in an appropriate way of any extension.  It should not have happened the way it did.  I know that on 13 February, the Minister did express her sympathy with survivors' concerns that their ages and health profiles mean there is an urgency to resolve this situation.  I hope this means there will not be any more unnecessary delays.  Dr. Shannon has been asked what can be done with the current legislative framework in respect of collecting biological samples and safeguarding those samples.  Eight weeks from now, before Easter, we should have that report from Dr. Shannon.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the commission had a very extensive body of work in meeting former residents and those connected to the institutions being investigated.  We know there are more individuals awaiting hearings, and they must be heard.  Then there is the analysis of the documentary evidence, the cross-referencing and the forensic excavation of the burial ground at the children's home in Tuam.  We were told the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs provided a lot of material, but why was some of it received so late by the commission, with possibly more material to come?  It is almost like a drip-feeding of information to the commission.  It is hard to understand all the requests for the extensions and why an exercise was not carried out at the start of the process that would have come up with realistic deadlines based on the amount of work that was to be done and the expectations involved.  The deadlines were never going to be met and they are still not being met.  With each missed deadline trust is being eroded, and with each delay confidence in the process of realising justice has been seriously undermined.  Then there is a question of the cost of each delay.  Is there a costing of where we are to date with the extra delays?  Are there further costs for staff and for the premises being used?<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the invaluable work of Catherine Corless, in the discovery of the remains of 796 children in 2014, and that figure could be conservative.  It is really hard to comprehend and envisage almost 800 children buried in the one area.<\/p>  <p>  The excavations yesterday at Sean Ross Abbey indicated there may be 269 buried there.  How many more bodies are going to be found?  The campaigners' research would indicate that as many as 800 children may have died there.  In the case of Bessborough mother and baby home, the register shows 470 infants and ten women who died there between 1934 and 1953.  Behind each body is a real person with an identity, but that identity has been eroded.  Apart from not having a life, even in death these people did not get recognition in the form of a plaque, a monument or a stone with their name on it.  We have been rightly horrified by the mass graves in Rwanda, Bosnia and Syria.  It is just so ironic, so incredible, that we are looking at a similar situation, similar graves, here in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Tuam Home Survivors Network has said, \"Results from our ageing and, in some cases, frail membership should be banked to eliminate any delay in returning human remains to identifiable relatives for dignified burials.\"  Those human beings were not given any respect or dignity in life, so surely the request for dignity in death and burial can be expedited.  We are all very disturbed by those who would deny the Holocaust, for example.  It is important we do not do the same here and deny or try to hide behind what has happened.  Again, Catherine Corless's point is that our history is never forgotten.  The relatives and the survivors are entitled to comprehensive information, and if they do not get it, that means that the ill-treatment, the mistreatment and the abuse continue.<\/p>  <p>  I have a positive view of restorative justice.  I have seen its effectiveness in the healing process.  However, for it to have a chance to help or to heal, information is vital, and the information must be available.  The question then is, can justice be achieved if none of the information being sought by the survivors is forthcoming?<\/p><p>People talk about closure, but I dislike that word.  It almost suggests that the door can be closed on the past and the pain, which I find disrespectful.  The pain can be eased, however, and it can be released but the experience will live with people for ever.  The release and relief will come when those affected have all the information.  We seem to have a terrible fear of acknowledging, facing or coping with the truth, not only in Ireland but also in other places.  I am reminded of another group with which I am involved, namely, Justice for the Forgotten, which represents the victims of those caught in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and their relatives.  They have waited 45 years for the truth, as are the families of those who were killed in other atrocities in the Troubles.  Authorities have sat on the information and the truth, which is disrespectful, indifferent and callous to the pain and heartache of those affected, who are waiting on the truth.  While apologies, redress and financial payments are important, the truth is paramount.  Nevertheless, this continued secrecy remains, whether in the case of the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries or Justice for the Forgotten.  The secrecy and lack of access to information and truth continues the abuse.<\/p> <p> We might reflect on the Holocaust and how it has been remembered through memorials and preservation, whether in the Holocaust museums in Berlin and Jerusalem or the concentration camps, all of which face the truth.  All the information is available and the victims' names are printed in order that people can see.  For the same reason, we need a repository for all the records and an appropriate, dignified memorial.  The most effective redress is access to information, which means not being afraid of the truth.  That leads us to the subject of access to birth and adoption records.  Some of those who had been adopted did not know, for various reasons, that they had been, some did not know from where they had been adopted, while the parents of others passed away before the information could be passed on and, therefore, no records were left.  I acknowledge the work produced by the Justice for Magdalenes, the Adoption Rights Alliance and the Clann Project following extensive interviews and conversations with people who sadly had been separated from their family members and communities through an appalling system, which took children into institutions such as mother and baby homes and enforced secret adoptions and disappearances.  It was such a blight on Irish society.<\/p> <p> In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, welcomed the Clann Project submission and the courage it took to provide the testimony.  I had asked what would happen to the records and the Minister replied that it would be a matter for the prescribed Minister.  She is supportive of transparency and the importance of the truth but those two words - \"transparency\" and \"truth\" - demand acknowledging the pain.  That is more important than closure.  It is an extremely dark aspect of our history and we cannot just close the door on it.  We must acknowledge and recognise it.  A suitable, appropriate memorial, which concerns the access to truth and everything that happened, would be fitting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100032#JJ00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550762100,"counter":401,"content":"<p>My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, welcomed the commission and its establishment as a vital recognition of the considerable harm that mothers and their children experienced in mother and baby homes throughout the country.  We saw the commission as a means to bring justice to the victims of these homes.  However, while the commission was established in February 2015, which was four years ago this month, to investigate the concerns related to the institutional care of unmarried mothers and their babies, we must recognise and acknowledge why it was set up.  It was established on foot of disturbing reports that a significant number of human remains had been discovered at the site of the former Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.  Like previous speakers, I pay tribute to Catherine Corless who did exemplary work to ensure that the story got out and that the victims would have the opportunity to be treated with dignity and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The deeply saddening discovery of five years ago, the aftermath of which continues, underscores the importance of the ongoing commission of investigation into mother and baby homes throughout the country.  The initial report of the commission was originally due in February 2018 but it was granted an extension.  It is a little disappointing that the commission now has another year to publish its final report, which will now be available in 2020 at the earliest.  The Government has stated, however, that it can make no decision on compensating the dwindling band of former residents until the commission has delivered its final report.  Some survivors of these institutions who are in their later years are losing hope that they will ever see a report from the commission.  Fianna F&aacute;il is disappointed to see yet another extension to the commission of investigation's timeline, particularly for the survivors and their families, who have waited for the report for one year and will continue to do so for another year.  The Government must do everything in its power to ensure the report is completed as soon as possible.  I take on board Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point about closure.  There will never be complete closure but there is a way to recognise what women and their children went through.  We must try to acknowledge what happened and restore some dignity to the survivors.  That is extremely important.<\/p>  <p>  Although we must try to reach some type of conclusion in supporting the survivors who have waited a long time and must establish some type of dignified memorial on the site, we are speaking about historical abuse of women and children.  We cannot lose sight of women and children who are suffering today.  Some 1,400 children are in direct provision, while almost 4,000 children are in emergency accommodation.  While it is important that we look back on the wrong deeds that were done to the children of years past and a previous generation, there must be a renewed focus on supporting children who are currently in direct provision and emergency accommodation.  I have no doubt that in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, Deputies will stand in the Chamber and discuss what was done and not done to help those children.  A commission may be put in place at that point to investigate why more was not done for them.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for listening.  I have no doubt that she will convey our messages to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100033#KK00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1550762100,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The issue is close to me because I know a number of women who were residents of the homes and who raised various issues with me.  Their lives, as well as those of their families and others around them, were traumatised and they feel aggrieved that the situation has been pushed back again.  They had expected and looked forward to the conclusion of the issue, not now but sooner.  In the case of two women I have come to know well, their upbringing in the traumatic circumstances of the homes affected them, their relationships with their children and their relationships with others in their families.  They believe the State has not provided for them and that it has instead turned its back and walked away.  The situation has been allowed to continue and the commission has not achieved the results it was expected to achieve.  While I understand many people have been interviewed and much work has been done, in reply to various parliamentary questions tabled by my party colleagues and others about whether everything was on stream, whether the report would be finished on time and whether the commission was working, we were assured at all times that everything was hunky-dory and that there was no problem.<\/p><p>At the 11th hour of the 11th day, it is postponed again for another year.  Many of these people are of advanced years and failing health.  It is not just about their physical health.  Many of these people have had very traumatic lives of very poor mental health.  Mental health issues are prevalent in many of these problems that many women involved have suffered.<\/p> <p> I have been conscious of a number of people who were children who grew up in some of those homes over periods and have ended up out in the community.  I spoke about it before.  In decades gone by, many children who came from the homes were put out with families and farmers, and worked with farmers.  In my area, they were known as home boys.  While some of them were treated very well in some places, in many cases they were not and had very difficult lives.  They grew up in an institution, had no experience of family life and no experience of how to interact in a community.  In many cases, they were the butt of a joke, made fools of and were maligned in the community.  My mother often talks about how, when she went and worked in England, she met them in the dance halls.  They were equal there as with all Irish immigrants but it is the first place that they found equality.  Many of those young men grew up and have a very bitter attitude towards the country that they came from.<\/p> <p> I know many in my community.  I remember there was an old man, when we were going to school, Eddie Whiffen, who had a big long beard, big long coat and a slight twang of an English accent.  Everyone laughed and joked about poor Eddie but Eddie was one of those people who came from a home and suffered greatly throughout his life.  There were many others throughout rural communities all over the country.  Many of them were treated very badly.  That was a reflection of the society that we lived in at that time.  It was a cruel, difficult Ireland.  We have an opportunity to acknowledge that, accept that significant wrongs were done and move forward.<\/p> <p> Much of this is about the unfortunate children who did not survive in those homes and who died there, as we have seen in Tuam and many other places.  While that has been exposed, most of us are aware that much more is to come with regard to all of that.  It is clear that the Government has to step in and not just acknowledge what has happened but actually do something for them.  The bodies of the victims in those situations need to be given proper, dignified burials.  There needs to be acknowledgement of the wrong that was done to them, sometimes by religious institutions but also by the State.  All of this has to happen in a way that reflects the new Ireland that we want to be and the future that we want to build.  We have to leave that past behind and grow up out of it.  If we are to grow up out of it, we need to make this happen very quickly.<\/p> <p> Waiting and waiting is telling these people who are victims of it that they do not matter.  I think they matter.  They are equal citizens and have an equal right to a space in our society and community as everyone else does.  They need to be acknowledged and the only way to acknowledge them is to lift them up.  The issues that many of them faced are in their past but they still relive it.  While they may never be able to get over it, the only way for us as a society to get over it is to do the right thing.  Unfortunately, what we see happening here with this being pushed further out all the time and a lot of vagueness about where it will end is that many of these women come to the conclusion that they do not matter, that their lives do not matter and that the children they saw die in the homes do not matter.<\/p> <p> There is a significant responsibility on the Government to do the right thing here.  The direction it has gone so far makes many wonder whether Government is really committed to doing the right thing.  The sooner we can get to a conclusion, the better.  Pushing it out for another year without any sense of delivery is not the way forward.  That has to be acknowledged by the Minister.  Having said that, we in Sinn F&eacute;in want to support anything that can be done to drive this forward, but the right thing needs to be done and it can no longer be hidden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100033#KK00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550762700,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Retraumatisation is a conscious or unconscious reminder of past trauma that results in a re-experiencing of the initial trauma event.  It can be triggered by a situation, an attitude or expression, or by certain environments that replicate the dynamics and the loss of power, control and safety of the original trauma.  Not being believed or listened to is another factor in trauma and retrauma.  The whole issue of the experiences of people who were incarcerated, locked away and hidden behind the walls of the so-called mother and baby homes is only one part of a legacy of incarceration that is an open wound in this country.  It is a wound that we continue to leave untreated because the State has consciously avoided it and is now conducting a tactic of delay until they die.<\/p><p>The most recent delay has caused a great deal of distress for those survivors and their families who are still waiting for acknowledgment, for an apology and for redress.  To be clear, redress is not just about financial compensation.  It is also about acknowledging what happened, accepting responsibility and someone being held accountable.  Until we do that, the State continues to drag people through more traumas and cruelty every day.  We saw the awful way in which a small group of Magdalen survivors were wrongfully excluded from the redress scheme and the Government was heavily criticised by the Ombudsman for that exclusion.  It was unjustifiable and, in a similar way, the exclusion of a tiny group of survivors from the Protestant Bethany Home should also be heavily criticised.  The latest delay by the commission has a consequence of continuing that exclusion for that small group of people.  There is no legitimate reason for them to have been left out in the first place and it is absolutely shameful that the Government is not intervening now.  There is ample evidence of cruelty and neglect of children and babies at the Bethany Home.  There is also evidence of the State's involvement in placing children in this home, of funding this home and of concerns flagged about the conditions there.<\/p><p>In 1939, the clerk of the Rathdown Board of Assistance wrote to the secretary of local government, raising concerns about a child in poor health and rickety condition, and specifically asked that provision is made for inspection of the Bethany Home.  In 1940, a request directly to the medical inspector of local government asked that the matter be inquired into as several children have been sent to the nurse in the district from time to time from this home suffering from rickets.  Between 1922 and 1949, 223 children from the Bethany Home were buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in unmarked graves.  Some 175 were between four weeks and two years old, 25 were aged from a few hours to four weeks old, and 19 were stillborn.  The causes of death recorded tell a story of neglect, with 54 from convulsions, 26 from malnutrition, 12 from delicacy, seven from pneumonia, and 19 with no cause given.  That the State played a role in the use of the Bethany Home structure is undeniable.  Correspondence in 1946 from the secretary of Monaghan County Council states:<\/p><blockquote>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to refer to the County Manager&rsquo;s Order (no. 4711) and to state that he will not object to payment being made at the rate of 15 shillings per week in respect of patients maintained in Bethany home Rathgar.<\/blockquote><p>Last week, a survivor, Joyce McSharry, got in touch with us.  She sent her story.  She also sent it to the Minister in the hope that it would be read and viewed with some empathy as it deserves to be.  The response from the Minister's office was, sadly, a typical bureaucratic reply that did not acknowledge the story that Joyce went to great lengths to write and explain that it had actually been read.  I have no doubt that it was a very difficult and traumatic thing for Joyce to have to put down in writing.<\/p><p>I do not have time to read it all but here is a selection from her letter:<\/p><blockquote>My birth mother Emily Sheppey was born in Islington in London in 1928 she was a member of the Church of England.  She gave birth to me in 1951 in the Protestant Bethany home in Dublin where I remained with my mother until the following December, at which time I underwent a peculiar irregular adoption.  Over the last thirteen years I pieced together my roots with some success.  I have two life stories, one told to me and one I discovered.  I am unable to obtain a long version of my birth certificate, as the state has only an irregular version of my details.  My adoptive parents informed me that my mother died in 1951.  They said that a social worker visited a flat in which a woman was found dead in her bed from TB.  I was reportedly discovered in the bed beside her.  I was brought to St Ultan's hospital and then to the Bethany Home.  These details were elaborated upon as I grew.  The story is a lie.  I was shocked to discover in 2013 that my Parents always knew it to be a lie.  My mother Emily did die in a flat, but aged 48, lonely and alone, apart from her pet dog, a poodle, in Weston Super Mare, UK, in August 1976.  My second Presbyterian baptism was designed to erase the fact that my mother, Emily Sheppy, resided in the Bethany Home and was not dead.  In 2013 and 2014 I obtained adoption documents from PACT (formerly the Protestant Adoption Society)  One of them was an 'agreement' from 1951.  Its content is deeply upsetting.  It indicates that my mother was probably pressured into giving me up.  My adoptive parents participated in this charade and were therefore aware that my mother was alive.  I may have been told the &lsquo;death-of-TB-in-a flat&rsquo; story in an effort to prevent me from searching for my mother, and the document may have been designed to frighten my mother into not seeking me out.  Besides stipulating that I was to be brought up Protestant, the penniless Emily was threatened in the 'agreement' that should she attempt to contact her daughter, she would be liable retrospectively for &pound;26 minimum per annum (valued at &euro;913.25 in 2013), plus educational, medical, clothing and other costs.  An owner of the solicitor firm who drew up the documents was appointed as my mother&rsquo;s 'attorney', but not to represent Emily's interests.  It was designed so as to avoid contacting Emily under anticipated Adoption Act legislation.  This was explicitly stated.  This man (Ralph Walker) was a nephew of Bethany Home Residential Secretary, Hettie Walker, who also signed the 'agreement' ..... Thirteen years ago, In January 2002, I began attempting to trace my roots by contacting PACT (Protestant Adoption and Counselling Trust), which holds Bethany Home records.  For a &euro;100 fee, they first gave me a copy of a single line in a register and, in May 2003, my first cousin Pam's UK telephone number.  I therefore rang Pam cold.  She was astonished to hear this strange lrishwoman, about whom she had recently learned.  What astonished me was that Pam knew my mother, who was alive for the first 25 years of my life.  I did not know in 2002 that my (by now deceased) adoptive parents also knew.  Finding out in this way made me start to question all I thought I knew.  I was emotionally drained and extremely upset.  In fact I became very ill ..... I contacted Pam again in 2013.  We spent months talking on the phone getting to know each other.  It was decided I would go over to London to meet her and the family.  I had also contacted my mother&rsquo;s other brother, Fran, who lived in Shrewsbury.  I told him I was coming over and would like to meet him ..... Uncle Fran was always aware of my existence.  Fran gave me a very special and to this day treasured gift from my mother, 12 photographs of me from my Christening to six months old.  It was the first time I had seen photographs from this part of my life.  Fran kept them perfectly preserved after my mother died nearly forty years earlier in 1976.  She kept them all of her life.<\/blockquote><p>Joyce concludes her letter by saying how she would &quot;love to contact any other mothers who were present in Bethany between April and November 1951. It may help me to better understand the awful circumstances my mother endured there.&quot;  The heartbreak of her story, the damage of forced separation, the lies and cover-ups, the dodgy arrangements around illegal adoptions, are all connected back to mother and baby homes, and the Bethany Home behaved in the same manner as the other homes, the pain is no less for the survivors because they were Protestant rather than Catholic.  It is long overdue that we call a halt to this cruel exclusion of the survivors of the Bethany Home from redress.  I ask the Minister of State to read Joyce's letter in full and give her a good response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100034#LL00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550763300,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace for telling us Joyce's story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100035#MM00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1550763300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I might say a few words before reading the response from the Minister's office.  I thank Deputies Burton, Maureen O'Sullivan, O'Loughlin, Martin Kenny and Wallace.  I am sorry if I left anybody out.<\/p>  <p>  We all know about the unbelievable cruelty that happened in this country in the past and is probably still happening in some places and the loss of those children's lives and the loss for the parents of being able to hold their babies and of having their babies taken away from them.  As most speakers said, time is running out and it is up to us in government and elsewhere to make sure these people have the answers they deserve before they depart this world.  Deputy Wallace's contribution uncovers a story that most of us have sadly seen on television in the past year, where people are united not only with their parents but with siblings they did not know they had.  When watching programmes like that, I realise how lucky I was as a child to have the parents I had and to have known them as I did.  For many children, sadly, that did not happen.  I have taken some notes - I hope I can read my bad writing.  I thank the Deputies for their honesty and their in-depth knowledge of what happened and the discovery of the unbelievable records that we have and do not have and about the fact that so many children and mothers are buried in unmarked graves.  That is a real darkness that hangs over the country and all of us, as politicians and as members of society.  I assure all the speakers that I will bring some of the matters raised back to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, when I have had a chance to read my notes and put them in an email to her.<\/p>  <p>  I will read the prepared statement, but as I have only two minutes, I will not read it all.  On behalf of the Government, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has asked me to thank the Deputies who made contributions to the debate this afternoon and previously on 7 February.  Unfortunately, she cannot be here, which she regrets.<\/p>  <p>  The Government understands and shares the frustration and disappointment felt at the extension to the commission's timeframe.  The commission's work is a key step in our determination to establish, confront and accept the truth about this dark chapter in our recent history.  By remaining committed to this statutory investigation and by allowing an additional year for the commission to complete its work, we can achieve the necessary holistic understanding of what went wrong in the country.  As a country and a society, we shy away from establishing these deep truths at our peril.<\/p>  <p>  The options facing the Government were either to insist on the timeline and accept incomplete reports next month or allow the important work to be finalised.  The  Government believed the public interest was best served by facilitating the commission to complete its important work.<\/p><p>However, the Minister sought and received assurances that work which was completed in the meantime would be published.  A significant step in that regard will be the publication of a burials report in March.  It will give not only more background information on the site in Tuam but also on other sites of former mother and baby homes.  It would be wrong to predict or speculate on what the report will state on any particular site, but it is a significant piece of work as we continue towards establishing the truth about that period of our history.  The Minister has committed to bringing the report to the Government as soon as possible after it has been received, with a view to publishing it with Government approval.<br\/><br\/>The terms of reference for the inquiry were rightly ambitious in terms of their scope and timeframe.  Nobody thought it would be easy or quick.  Let us not forget that the commission is seeking to investigate circumstances and practices which, in some cases, were deliberately hidden and certainly not subject to intensive scrutiny at the time.  There are no short cuts to establishing the truth.  The Minister has asked the commission to make every effort to deliver its reports as soon as is practicable and in advance of February 2020, if possible.  In considering the time required to conclude its reports we must acknowledge the volume and complexity of the work before the commission.<br\/><br\/>In its report the commission acknowledges the extensive material provided by the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  While the report states the first tranche of discovery was delivered in March 2017, the commission has acknowledged that this is incorrect and that, in fact, the discovery of records commenced in February 2016. <br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The delivery consisted of more than 200 files that had been selected by the commission as a matter of priority.  The joint discovery process between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health is now complete.  In respect of the discovery of records from the HSE or any third party to the commission, it is important to state this is not something in which the Minister or her Department has a role.  The Minister is, however, satisfied that the commission has all of the necessary legal powers to obtain the records and testimony it needs to inform its investigation.<br\/><br\/>In response to the recent requests to begin collecting DNA samples of survivors and relatives the Minister has asked Dr. Geoffrey Shannon to examine whether it is possible to meet this request within the current legislative framework.  The examination will be carried out in the context of what is scientifically possible.  The terms of reference for the examination are available to view on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<br\/><br\/>Deputies have noted that there was upset among the survivor community as a result of finding out through the media about the commission's request for an extension.  For survivors to find out this upsetting news through the media was not what anyone wanted.  I have been assured that the information did not issue from the Minister's Department.  Communicating with former residents is a key concern of the Minister and the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100035#MM00300","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Prohibition of Above-cost Ticket Touting Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1550763900,"counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100036#NN00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550763900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550763900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I am not really sure where I was in my contribution.

In fact, I absolutely hate paying above the odds.  I remember being outside the old Lansdowne Road stadium in the early 1980s when tickets were being sold at an awful price and I could not afford to buy them.  I got a fellow to give me a leg up onto the wall and then the roof.  When I jumped down, I was seen by a garda who chased me as fast as he could.  I ran up the ramp of the south terrace and the place was jammed.  I put my head down to knee level and went right down into the terrace as fast as I could.  Of course, the garda never caught me.<\/p>  <p>  I remember another day on which I could not get a ticket and decided to try my luck.  I went through the turnstile as if I had a ticket and gave the man in it a tenner.  He let me in as it was a tenner for him and he did not mind one bit.  One could probably have called it bribery.  <\/p>  <p>  I remember attending the World Cup final in 1982 when Italy played Germany and won 3-1.  Rossi, Tardelli and Altobelli were the three scorers and it was a powerful win.  I did not have a ticket, but on the Saturday evening it was announced that tickets for the game, to be played on the Sunday afternoon, would go on sale at the stadium at 8 a.m. on the Sunday.  When I went there at approximately 7.45 a.m., without exaggeration, the queue was 2 miles long.  I did a count and there were about 6,000 people queueing for the 1,500 tickets available.  I went up to an Italian fellow who was fourth in the queue and asked if he knew how many tickets he would be allowed to buy.  He could speak a little English and said he did not know.  I told him that he would be allowed to buy four and asked how many he needed.  He only needed two.  I suggested he buy four and told him that I would give him 50% above the price of the other two.  Lo and behold, I got the two tickets I needed, unlike most of the people who had been queueing since the middle of the night.  One could have said it was also bribery, but I would resort to using any trick to get a ticket for a football match.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the subject of the Bill, the primary responsibility of any Government is to take the best care possible of those most in need of help.  I would say the same about legislators.  We should be putting all of our energy into dealing with issues such as the price of housing and dealing with homelessness.  Worrying about who can charge extra for a ticket should be down the list of our concerns.  This legislation is not workable and will only drive touting underground.  Making it illegal will not work.  As I said, it is illegal to sell drugs in Ireland, but there would be less drug use if they were legal.  Driving something underground does not work.  This is poor legislation.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to make better use of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100036#NN00800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1550763900,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Amusing as Deputy Wallace's stories are, it is regrettable that we have to spend time dealing with a useless piece of what I call \"soundbite legislation\".  I am getting sick at the number of times we have had to deal with such legislation.  I am awaiting the introduction of a Bill dealing with apple pie, something to which no one could possibly object but which would not bring apple pie to anybody.  This Bill will not deliver regulation of ticket touting either.  We are told that it will make it illegal to sell tickets for what are called \"major sporting, musical or theatrical events\" in venues with a capacity of more than 300 people at more than face value.  The Minister of State has said the 300-person limit will be raised to 1,000, just to make it really clear that nobody is really interested in what happens in small-scale venues or the grassroots arts.  It is all about big ticket events.  I am not really sure why the arbitrary 300-person limit was included in the Bill in the first place.  Is it the case that the promoters of the Bill want to see tickets for small gigs being sold at an exorbitant price?  What is the reasoning behind it?  If we are to ban above-cost ticket touting, I do not understand why we would not ban touting across the board.  Why make a distinction?  The only goal in having an arbitrary cut-off point seems to be to tell small-time artists and their fans that they do not really matter.  It is an unnecessary kick in the teeth for them.  The music industry is suffering as a result of this domination.  It is all about the big events and the media hype.  As a result, bands no longer tour in the way they used to.  They no longer travel around the country in a tour bus.  They play in one large venue and that is it.  The way in which the entertainment business is being organised does not harness creativity and waters down the experience of attending a live music event.  That is a debate we could be having.<\/p>  <p>  I go back to the random cut-off point of 300 which is soon to be raised to 1,000.  That tells us something about from where the Bill comes.  It springs straight from the hullabaloo about tickets for big events such as the U2 concerts in Croke Park or the all-Ireland finals when tickets sell for thousands of euro.  It is very amusing to see a Government that absolutely loves to charge Opposition Deputies with populism come here with legislation such as this.  As Deputy Wallace said, there are 4,000 children throughout the country who do not have a home.  The number of homeless families has quadrupled in a decade.  It is conservatively estimated that there are 10,000 people in the country who do not have a roof over their head, yet we are here talking about this legislation.  Last night the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il decried Sinn F&eacute;in's stunt of tabling a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  People in glasshouses really should not throw stones.  <\/p>  <p>  When the D&aacute;il resumed last month after the Christmas recess, we were told that the decks had to be cleared to deal with Brexit.  We were told that only the most pressing items of legislation would make the cut this session, that everything else had to be put into cold storage, yet here we are debating a Bill dealing with ticket touting.  It really gives us some idea of the Government's priorities at a time when nearly 1 million people are on HSE waiting lists.<\/p><p> In December, the Court of Appeal ruled, on foot of an appeal brought by Graham Dwyer, that our data retention law provides for a general and indiscriminate data retention regime.  There is a very real chance that one of the most high-profile persons accused of murder in the history of the State will walk free.  He will do so because the Government did not take the advice of a Supreme Court judge whom it appointed to look at our data retention laws in 2017 and informed us that our data protection laws were in need of radical change.  They were not changed and we are not changing them now.  I see no sign of the Government even stirring to save us from this.  I do not see any Bill amending our data retention laws on the priority list for this session and we are not debating such legislation here today either.  Instead, we are here dealing with somebody wanting to buy tickets to a concert or some other event - seriously.<\/p> <p> On Second Stage, the Minister signalled that she would bring forward a range of amendments on Committee Stage.  From trying to marshal and push the Coroners Bill through these Houses - not just in the lifetime of this Government but in the lifetime of that which preceded it - I know how absolutely, incredibly slow and difficult the process of getting amendments drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, can be. I would like an assurance from the Minister of State that the amendments under debate at present are not going to be given precedence over the Report Stage amendments to the Coroners (Amendment) Bill, which the same OPC people are supposed to be helping to draft.  We are three years waiting for mandatory inquests into maternal deaths.  Three years waiting for something that everybody in this House agrees is a priority, yet the drafters and amendment merchants are still plugging away.  It had better happen soon and this legislation, with all the amendments the Minister has flagged, had better not lead to it falling down the pecking order.<\/p> <p> The point is that it is a tortuous process.  Countless Private Member's Bills have passed Second Stage.  There are 69 of them before various committees, most of which require money messages from the Government.  Issuing such messages is something only the Government can do.  Of course, money messages will not be forthcoming, not because they are bad Bills - most of them are a hell of a lot better than that before the House - but because the Government believes it can marshal and bully its way through.  We talk about democracy in other countries and yet this stifling goes on here.  Very few Private Member's Bills pass through all Stages.  It is pretty regular now that the only ones that are getting through are from the Government benches, like the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill to which Deputy Wallace referred, a complete nonsense that will achieve absolutely nothing.  That is not the way in which things should be done.  Sinn F&eacute;in had a ticket touting Bill in respect of which the Government would not issue a money message and now we are here discussing this nonsense.  That is new politics - Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael's priority.  This is the first Bill in the history of the State presented jointly by Government and Opposition, or the confidence and supply parties or whatever, and it relates to ticket touting.  All those involved should all be absolutely ashamed of themselves.<\/p> <p> I find it grimly amusing that the arch free marketeers of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are full square behind a Bill that places a price cap on a commodity.  This tells us something about priorities.  They would sooner die than put a price cap on a good like housing or the price of a child going to primary school but they are very happy to intervene to keep the price of tickets for rugby matches down.  When it comes to housing, their attitude is, \"Sorry about that now, supply and demand, the State cannot be interfering with the market.\"  If I did not laugh, I would have to cry over this.  The Government flat out refused to introduce rent caps but now it is falling over itself to put a cap on the resale of tickets for football matches.  Are the Deputies opposite actually serious about this?  Refusing to introduce rent caps has pushed countless people into homelessness.  Refusing to put a cap on concert ticket prices will not put people into homelessness because they cannot cobble together a few bob for a resale ticket to see U2.<\/p> <p> What is more ironic is that the Bill is going to do nothing to address the fact that Irish people are charged exorbitant prices for tickets in the first instance.  If dealing with ticket prices was the priority, the Government could start with that because it might actually be able to do something about it.  Fatboy Slim is playing in the 3Arena the week after next.  Ticket prices run from &euro;51.50 to &euro;61.  A few weeks later, he is playing in Utrecht in the Netherlands.  There, the tickets are &euro;28, nearly half the price for the exact same gig.  Drake is playing in the 3Arena in April.  Ticket prices start at &euro;79 and go up to &euro;276.  To see the same artist in Belgium, people will pay from &euro;56 up to a maximum of &euro;106 for premium seats.  The Government should be asking if the touts are the real rip-off merchants here.  Should this not be the aspect to focus on if it really wants to bring down the cost of tickets?<\/p> <p> From listening to previous speakers, it appears that much of the impetus behind the Bill comes from what we could call the industrialisation of ticket touting, or large-scale ticket touting.  This has happened thanks to advances in technology and the concurrent explosion of ticket resale sites.  That is a fact.  As I understand it, tickets go on sale and then appear minutes later on a resale site for a higher price.  The Bill targets the people doing the selling and leaves the websites alone.  Let us see if that makes any sense.  The people who run these resale websites do not do it for the good of their health; they charge a transaction fee for each ticket sold.  In the case of Ticketmaster, it had two bites at the cherry until it shuttered Seatwave.  Ticketmaster got a transaction fee when it sold the original ticket and then got another transaction fee when that ticket was sold on.  No doubt when Ticketmaster sets up its \"fan-to-fan\" ticket exchange, it will continue to charge transaction fees.  If Seatwave is anything to go by, those ticket transaction fees will not be cheap.  In one case I know of, for an Electric Picnic ticket costing &euro;285, the transaction fee was &euro;52.99.  That was after Seatwave had already charged the seller a 10% success fee.  The word \"racket\" springs to mind.<\/p> <p> The sad thing is that the Bill is not going to stop any of this.  If its sponsors were actually serious about ending the industrialisation of touting, they would be banning resale websites from charging resale or transaction fees.  They are not doing that.  There is absolutely nothing in the Bill to stop me from setting up a resale website tomorrow, writing a computer script to snap up a few hundred tickets for the next big gig in Croke Park and flogging them all at face value on my resale site with an added 50% or 500% transaction fee.  The Minister has indicated that she is going to bring forward amendments to prevent bots from being used to buy tickets in bulk.  Is she really?  Given that there is no commonly agreed definition of bots and that the people who use them are smart enough to disguise their use, that is not going to get her very far at all.  Even if by some miracle, the Government manages to do what no-one else in the world can do, it would take two minutes for someone to pay a bunch of lads in Bangladesh tuppence ha'penny to go in and snap up the tickets manually.  There are loads of other ways around this legislation and I am not going to repeat the points made by Deputy Wallace last week.  Someone could get their ticket at face value and then pay &euro;700 for access to the pen, or a reseller could legally add in a lunch and stick on a few hundred euro for that.<\/p> <p> This Bill is not going to stop touting.  It will change touting, of course, but it will not stop it.  That is not the intention.  This is just to get a cheap headline, that is all, yet Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are the people going on about populism.  They are wasting our time because this is not even going to work and, particularly when there are some really serious matters that the State needs to get to grips with, it is highly regrettable.  The list is too long to deal with here.<\/p><p> It breaks my heart that we debating legislation relating to ticket touting on the same day that Philomena Canning felt she had no choice but to go public with the fact that she is dying from ovarian cancer in the hope that she can persuade the HSE to settle her case so that she can afford to buy Pembro, the cancer drug.  It makes me angry beyond words that this brilliant, caring and powerful midwife is being denied free access to this drug because she has \"the wrong type of cancer\".  If she had cervical cancer, she would be receiving Pembro, but she does not.  It is a thundering disgrace that the Government has entirely and arbitrarily created a two-tier system of \"deserving\" and \"less-deserving\" cancer patients, and that it has done so as a PR exercise.  Philomena Canning has been left to suffer.  She may die.  We could be discussing matters of that nature.  This woman has given her life in the service of other women.  Her livelihood was destroyed by the HSE when it suspended her with no notice in September 2014.  The High Court upheld the suspension, but, ahead of an appeal, both Ms Canning and the HSE commissioned a number of expert reports into the cases at issue, all of which stated that she had acted entirely professionally.  As a result, the HSE dropped its appeal three days before the scheduled hearing.  Her indemnity insurance was reinstated, but the HSE went on to conduct a systems analysis into her practice and found that she had made administrative errors-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100036#NN00900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550765100,"counter":417,"content":"<p>The Deputy is straying a long way from the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100038#PP00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1550765100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>-----not medical errors.

Ms Canning has been dragged through a four-year discovery process by the HSE and her time has run out.  She is dying, unfortunately, of cancer.  We need to rip up the HSE policy of deny, defend and waste time that has devastated the lives of so many people.  If one good thing could come from this afternoon, it would be if the Minister of State asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to intervene on Philomena Canning's behalf with the HSE in order that she can get the settlement she deserves before it is too late.<\/p>  <p>  Instead, we are here talking about ticket touts.  It is in indictment of the so-called confidence and supply agreement that this situation has arisen and that this Bill is the best that the Government can come up with.  I am actually genuinely embarrassed for the Government.  Deputy Rock went out on the plinth with a cardboard cut-out of what was supposed to be a ticket tout but what looked more like a flasher in a raincoat and a hat.  Deputy Rock was kicking him.  If any of us did that we would be condemned for inciting violence by kicking another human being.

It puts up a headline.  People do not want to be ripped off for concert tickets.  Of course they do not.  This, in a very populist way, suggests that ticket touting is being got rid of and that overpriced tickets and excess fees are being dealt with.  The Bill does not do that.  There are absolutely loads of ways around this legislation.  It is really regrettable that this Bill has made the cut at a time when the decks were supposed to be cleared to deal with Brexit.  Only the most important legislation was to make the cut, but the very fact that the Minister of State announced, without enough detail, that there are going to be substantial amendments to this Bill means automatically that she knows it is faulty and that it is going to have to be substantially redrafted.  The Government knows that redrafting takes a huge amount of time and that amendments take forever.  This nonsense is not going to progress.  It is before the House to create cheap and populist headlines.  When there are so many important issues to deal with, this is a bad indictment on this House.  We are often told that legislation like this sends a signal.  What signal does it send?  It signals that this is a really useless place that does not pay sufficient attention to the job that we were elected to do, which is to bring forward good legislation that stands up to scrutiny.  Instead, we bring in poor legislation.

This is a democratic system and everyone is entitled to speak.  That is the whole idea of electing legislators.  Overall this was a very well informed and constructive debate.

She agrees with the strong sentiment expressed by Deputies that ticket profiteering must be tackled in the interests of sport and music fans throughout Ireland.

Last night, within the nine stations in the north east a total of 22 staff should have been rostered for duty.  Unfortunately, there were only 12 and in most cases they were rostered on a single person basis.  Stations affected last night included those in Drogheda, Ardee, Virginia, Monaghan, Castleblayney and Dundalk.  Basically, this meant that in Castleblayney, where there should have been two staff on an ambulance, there was only one rostered on duty.  One staff member cannot man or take out an ambulance except to act as first responder in the event of a cardiac arrest.<\/p>  <p>  This problem began approximately eight months ago, when management informed the staff in Monaghan and Castleblayney stations that new rosters were to be introduced without delay bringing six new staff in total to the region.  Needless to say, this was welcomed by all staff and a roster was worked on to incorporate the new staff.  Around November of last year, management then said they had never agreed to six new staff and instead appointed two to Monaghan and two to Castleblayney.  New rosters were eventually agreed and put into place with management insisting that they were to become operational on certain dates.  I believe those dates were to be in January for Monaghan and from last Monday for Castleblayney.  The rosters have become operational but no new staff have been provided to populate these rosters.  It has been described to me as like putting an amount of orange cordial into a larger amount of water.  It might look all right but it does not taste the same.  The service now has the same staff attempting to fill a bigger roster.  They were already short staffed beforehand so this has added greatly to this serious problem.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing staff shortages are due to a combination of sick leave, annual leave and the simple fact that there are not enough staff.  In addition to these problems, this week paramedic staff were also on electronic patient care report training.  The staff had to be released to attend the training.  The training is to facilitate the move from paper to electronic care reports for patients.  Again, this is being completed to a management deadline with little or no consideration for the impact on already depleted services.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of an ambulance in Castleblayney is problematic.  The new roster came with the understanding by staff that an ambulance would be provided to complete the roster.  Staff were recently told that this ambulance is now not available and that they should use the ambulances they have.  That is all well and good except that on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday there is a 7 a.m. crew and a 10 a.m. crew for 12 hour shifts.  If both these crews are out on late calls at 7 p.m., then there would be no ambulance available to deploy even if there were staff on duty.  The practice has been that when a problem occurs with rostering, a text is sent out looking for staff to cover the shift.  This is a regular occurrence.  The core rostering system does not work and the failure by those in charge to engage with staff is adding to the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100039#QQ00300","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1550765700,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address, on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, the matter of the ambulance service in the north east.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is pleased to inform the House that six additional staff have been approved to be deployed to the Monaghan and Castleblayney ambulance stations.  The additional staff are expected to be in place in the coming weeks and will provide an additional emergency ambulance at both stations during weekdays.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to access to vehicles.  Significant capital funding has been allocated to the HSE National Ambulance Service annually to support the vehicle replacement policy.  The National Ambulance Service has undertaken a number of measures to address the issue of ambulance service provision in the north east.  There has been significant investment in manpower, fleet and technology in recent years.  An additional 25 patient and clinical care staff were assigned to the north Leinster region during 2018.  This region covers the counties referred to by the Deputy.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, acknowledges that in the Border counties the National Ambulance Service works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to provide a more responsive service for the region.<\/p>  <p>  The capital review published in 2016 identified particular difficulties in serving rural areas, such as the north east.  The capital review indicated that the only way to improve first response times in rural areas in particular is through voluntary community first responder schemes.  The National Ambulance Service continues to work with local CFR groups throughout the region to enhance services, with 29 CFR groups operating in the counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.<\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years and several important service innovations and developments have taken place.  The national emergency operations centre has been established.  Emergency calls are received and emergency resources are dispatched from the centre.  The National Ambulance Service now has full visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.  In addition, the National Ambulance Service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, thus freeing up emergency ambulances for the more urgent calls.  A permanent emergency aeromedical support service has been established to provide a more timely response to persons in rural areas.  Other recent developments include the development of alternative pathways to care.  The hear-and-treat clinical hub went live in the national emergency operations centre in March last year.  This service diverts some lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments, freeing up some emergency capacity.  The anticipation is that such initiatives will help to improve the availability of ambulance resources in the country, including in the north east.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, year-on-year additional investment has been directed towards the National Ambulance Service.  This year the National Ambulance Service budget has increased to an unprecedented &euro;168.6 million.  This will support the National Ambulance Service in continuing to deliver a high-quality service in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100039#QQ00400","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1550765700,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I welcome the fact that she has admitted there is an issue.  While some of the remarks of the Minister of State are at variance with the situation, I welcome the fact that there is commitment to implement the full complement of six staff as per her statement and the fact that additional ambulance vehicles will be made available.  I will be holding the Minister of State and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to account in this regard.  Having said that, rural Ireland and regional health services are not the same as in Dublin city, where there are up to six emergency departments.  Down through the years the Department of Health, in its wisdom, reduced the number of emergency departments.  In the north east we basically have an emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and Cavan General Hospital.<\/p><p>We introduced minor treatment units in Louth County Hospital in Dundalk and in Monaghan Hospital.  To leave people who have concerns and are vulnerable in rural isolation - it is perhaps not as acute in the north east as it is in other areas, although it is when compared with the facilities available in the Dublin region - is very unfair.  We need to have enough emergency medical vehicles, ambulances, paramedics and, indeed, advanced paramedics available.<\/p> <p> I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the issue of recruitment of ambulance staff, which is not like the recruitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but unfortunately it is being treated in the same way.  It is a national appointment.  A simple solution would be not having ambulance personnel travelling from places as far away as Donegal to work in Davitt Road in Dublin, for example.  Staff should be deployed in their localities.  The recruitment system for paramedics should not be national.  There could be a national application system, but people should be appointed locally and the rosters would work much better.<\/p> <p> I look forward to further communication with the Minister of State on this issue and on the concerns not only about the staffing of the ambulance service but the concerns of the people I represent who are vulnerable when it comes to the ambulance service as in the case last night where ambulances were not available and the roster was not sufficient to cover the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100039#QQ00500","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550766300,"counter":431,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, I assure the House that the National Ambulance Service is focused on improving the ambulance service in the north-east region and throughout the country.

Currently, an adult patient in the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, has to be referred to the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, while a paediatric patient has to be referred to Dublin.  Given the fact that Mullingar is a paediatric hospital for the midlands, this is simply unacceptable as it is causing seriously long delays for our patients.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Minister of State a brief history of this issue.  A number of years ago the HSE promised the community of Mullingar that if it paid for the scanner the HSE would stump up and build and staff the unit with the specialist staff required.  I want to acknowledge the Friends of Regional Hospital Mullingar, the group which was established, and I thank the many fundraisers, both small and big.  We had a fundraiser in memory of the late Johnny Murphy, which raised &euro;205,000, we had cake sales, 5K road races,; families climbed Croagh Patrick and schools had pyjama days and we had crazy hair days.  As a result of this array of fundraising efforts, the target has now been met and the MRI scanner funding is now in place to purchase this scanner.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department, which I acknowledged, has approved bringing the building to design and planning stage and the HSE officials have over the last number of months been engaging with the planning authority to try to address any of the obstacles that may be in the way when an official planning application is made.  I understand now that many of those obstacles have been addressed, many of the challenges have been ironed out and it is anticipated that a formal planning application will be made by the HSE to Westmeath County Council in a matter of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I raise this issue today is to seek assurances that once this planning application is approved - it is anticipated that this will happen in a matter of months - there will be no delay in advancing resources to bring this project to the next and final stages, which is the tender and construction stages.  This is an essential piece of infrastructure for early diagnosis, for investigation of many conditions, including stroke and cardiology and for people attending for surgery and the casualty units.  It is also critical as the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, is the main maternity hospital for the midlands.  Anybody with a knowledge of maternity care will know that best practice for babies born prematurely is to ensure they have an MRI scan.<\/p>  <p>  We have come a long way, thanks to the Trojan efforts of the Friends of Regional Hospital Mullingar committee but also thanks to the huge voluntary efforts of so many people who have arranged so many fundraisers.  The funding is in place for the MRI scanner.  We are ready to lodge a planning application to Westmeath County Council in a matter of weeks and we should have a planning decision within a matter of months.

I understand a submission for capital works to accommodate the provision of a second CT scanner for the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, is currently being prepared by the hospital management in conjunction with the local HSE estates office.  The submission will have to be considered by the HSE&rsquo;s capital steering committee before it can be approved.  The application for a second CT scanner for the hospital will also be considered in the context of all other priority medical equipment replacement requests across all acute hospitals and subject to the availability of capital funding.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of a new MRI at Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, is included in the proposed new extension of the radiology department at the hospital.  The project team is currently at an advanced stage in the pre-planning process with a view to lodging a full planning application in the first quarter of 2019.  The HSE intends to complete the design of the project in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Friends of Regional Hospital Mullingar, already referred to by the Deputy, has completed substantial fundraising to support the MRI facility and the Minister would like to acknowledge its contribution.<\/p>  <p>  The timeframe for the completion of these capital projects will be subject to the successful completion of the planning permission process and the availability of capital funding.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is happy to confirm that the provision of the new MRI facility at Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, has been included in the national development plan, NDP, announced last year, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative.  The NDP provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects across acute, primary and  social care.  The delivery of the NDP projects and programmes, including developments at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, will result in healthcare facilities that will allow for the implementation of new models of care and for the delivery of services in high quality modern facilities.<\/p><p> The Department of Health and the HSE are currently engaged in a process to finalise the HSE capital plan for 2019.  The plan will determine the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the total available capital funding and the relevant priorities of each project.  All health capital projects currently at various stages of development, such as those at Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, are included as part of this process.  Once the HSE has finalised its capital plan, it will be submitted to the Minister for Health for his consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100040#RR00600","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550766900,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I accept that the Minister of State is only present to represent the Minister, Deputy Harris, and that she does not have the authority to give definitive commitments.

Accordingly, our options are: to proceed with the project in two phases, which I suggested last year, and commence the badly needed and long overdue metro north element first; and to assess the various alternative routes set forth by the Opposition, thereby certainly delaying the badly needed and long delayed metro beyond 2027.

A third option is to run the risk of no metro project at all, which is the least desirable option.<\/p><p>I am running out of time, so I will keep my first question to the Minister simple.<\/p><p>Given the report in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that the Minister sought and had a crisis meeting with the NTA and given the report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>which details that the proposal which will come before the public mirrors my suggestion that the northside project proceed first, can the Minister confirm this is his current understanding of the forthcoming proposal?  If not, can he confirm what the forthcoming proposal from the NTA is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100041#SS01300","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550767500,"counter":451,"content":"<p>If it is the case that the proposal to dig up the Luas green line has been abandoned, I welcome that.  It was a crazy proposal considering that hundreds of millions of euro were spent on constructing a very effective and popular Luas line.  I ask the Minister to bring clarity to the matter because such clarity does not exist.  We have read reports in newspapers.  Does the Minister know whether the proposal has been abandoned?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also needs to recognise that a metro on the southside should not be abandoned.  As Deputy Lahart and I have repeatedly argued, Dublin is crying out for a metro service to places in the south west of the city such as Terenure, Templeogue, Firhouse and Rathfarnham, which are areas outside my constituency.  It is necessary to have a proper effective metro system in the city.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will also be aware that there is a proposal in respect of BusConnects.  Some of the proposals are useful.  We need to have faster bus traffic into the city and we need cycle lanes, but there is also a proposal that would significantly impact people living on Kimmage Road Lower, Rathfarnham Road, Terenure Road East and Rathgar Road.  In respect of the last three of those roads, it is proposed that the NTA compulsorily acquire up to 6 m from the front gardens of houses in the area.  This would cost a fortune is impractical and is vehemently opposed by people in the area.<\/p>  <p>  We need sensible joined-up thinking in respect of transport proposals for the city.  I ask the Minister to recommend to the NTA that it keep the drilling machine to be used for the metro project from the airport into the city centre and direct it south-west to those parts of the city that are crying out for public rail infrastructure.  As Deputy Rock said, that would be a great legacy for the Minister to leave.  However, he needs to identify what the political objectives are.  If he does so, he would secure support of local communities.  There is an opportunity to link up the metro system and the BusConnects system and solve a problem by coming up with a single integrated plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100042#TT00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1550767500,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this Topical Issue matter.  Obviously, I have read the media reports this week regarding MetroLink and the NTA's development of a preferred route for public consultation.  I can confirm that I met the NTA this week to be updated on the project.  Separately, I also met the chair of Transport infrastructure Ireland, TII, recently during which the issue of MetroLink was discussed.<\/p>  <p>  I have said repeatedly in the D&aacute;il that the NTA and TII are developing revised proposals regarding MetroLink.  It is obvious that those revised proposals will take account of the issues already raised by members of the public during last year&rsquo;s public consultation.  That should not be a shock to anyone here as it is the reason we have public consultations.  I welcome that State agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit are very proactive in engaging with members of the public and listening to their views.<\/p>  <p>  Last year&rsquo;s emerging preferred route gave rise to much public commentary, particularly regarding a number of different local areas across the city.  Major transformative projects will always cause impacts, although those impacts are ultimately intended to be positive.  We all know, however, that in order to get to that place, there can occasionally be unwelcome and sometimes unpalatable impacts.<\/p>  <p>  There is always a delicate balancing act between delivering an effective project and doing so in a way that minimises disruption.  I have made clear that it is very important that members of the public can continue to travel conveniently in Dublin.  That is essential, and travel disruption needs to be minimised.  That is precisely what the NTA and TII are seeking to do.  That are seeking to develop a new cross-city public transport corridor via Dublin Airport and out to Swords and, in doing so, increase capacity on the Luas green line.  In trying to achieve that ambition, they are also listening to the views of the public, particularly people living those along the Luas green line, on what level of disruption, if any, is acceptable to deliver the increased capacity the line needs.  We need to deliver, once and for all, the long-awaited cross-city link via the airport and out to north County Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on particular alignments or proposals while the statutory agencies are still completing their work.  As I have stated previously in this House, we need to move away from designing transport projects by press release and instead move towards what members of the public deserve, namely, planned and integrated development of public transport and land use strategies. We have a statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area which covers the period from 2016 to 2035.  That strategy is the basis for the development of an integrated transport system for the entire greater Dublin area.  It includes proposals across all public transport platforms, including metro, light rail and bus.  Development of the strategy was subject to a full public consultation period and any and all interested parties were able to make their views known.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies have specifically about the Rathfarnham-Terenure corridor.  I assure them that the needs of the entire city were considered by the NTA in drawing up its transport strategy.  That strategy included looking at present and future travel demands on all the key corridors.  The extremely detailed analysis conducted concluded that the actual and forecasted demand along the Rathfarnham-Terenure corridor does not meet the threshold that would justify a metro style service.  The corridor is relatively low density with limited potential for new development.  The present and future transport demand levels on the corridor are such that they can best be met through an improved bus service.  That is exactly what BusConnects will seek to provide.  MetroLink is a big project, one on which we all have views.  I reassure the House that, as Minister, I have two key priorities here, namely, delivering an improved public transport system to serve the needs of the public now and into the future, and making sure that the agencies do this in a way that avoids unacceptable travel disruption.  I have told my agencies that it would be unacceptable to have the Luas service closed for a significant period.  I have also told them that the suggestion Deputies have read about in the media that there would be closures for four years or something approaching that is absolutely off the agenda.  I will not countenance that sort of a delay or anything reflecting a fraction of it on any major piece of infrastructure or artery into any of our cities.<\/p>  <p>  I will encourage everyone to engage again with the NTA and TII when they launch their new public consultation after publishing their preferred route in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100042#TT00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1550767500,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Today was the first time I saw a reference to a delay of four years.

As the Minister rightly recognised, to shut it down for a period of even two weeks would be catastrophic for commuters.  He needs to clarify that.  He has not denied that the MetroLink project could close the line or parts of it for up to two years, which would be catastrophic for commuters.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also said - I am glad he put it in writing - that the Government does not support the provision of Luas or metro style transport to the various areas mentioned in my constituency.  I will bring that news back to my constituency.  The Minister made similar remarks when he launched Project Ireland 2040.  At the time, I stated in the House that Project Ireland 20140 had nothing for my constituency of Dublin South West.

I thank the Acting Chairman and the Business Committee for selecting this very important policy report for debate.<\/p><p>The joint committee was delighted to launch this report coming as it did after a significant period of consultation where we listened to witnesses from disability groups and transport groups.  More than 20 witnesses attended the committee's hearings last year, many of whom are in the Public Gallery this evening and we welcome them.<\/p><p>The Joint Committee heard some deeply moving evidence from many of those witnesses of their experiences around the inaccessibility of public transport and the challenges facing them, often on a daily basis, when trying successfully to complete bus, train and Luas journeys.  These are journeys that most of us take for granted.  I also thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, who appeared as a witness at our hearings, for accepting our committee&rsquo;s report, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s remarks.<\/p><p>This policy report, which formed a major part of the committee&rsquo;s work programme for 2018, sets out 16 key recommendations to pave the way towards equal access to public transport services for people with disabilities.  An accessible public transport system is vital to ensure that people with disabilities have full access to all spheres of Irish society: economic, educational, civic, social and leisure.<\/p><p>In order to develop these recommendations the committee met with a broad range of stakeholders to identify potential policy solutions to improve access to public transport services for people with disabilities.  These included disability activists and representatives including the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Deaf Society, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Council for the Blind Ireland and Inclusion Ireland.  Representatives from the various transport operators - Dublin Bus, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Transdev Ireland and the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland &mdash; also appeared before the committee, as did the National Disability Authority, the National Transport Authority, and the Minister, Deputy Ross.<\/p><p>The committee very much appreciates the deeply personal and moving accounts shared by witnesses with disabilities of the difficulties they personally encounter in using public transport.  Many of the witnesses described very concerning and completely unacceptable incidences of being stranded at a terminus at night, for example, with potentially no way of travelling home due to a lack of accessible buses.  They also described occasions of being left stranded on a train service with no means to disembark.  These stark experiences are evidence of the disadvantage, exclusion and unequal treatment that passengers with disabilities encounter while engaging with the public transport system.<\/p><p>The 16 recommendations contained in this report detail ways to increase the accessibility of Ireland&rsquo;s transport services, the aim being to achieve equal access for all to this vital and necessary resource.  First and foremost our committee calls on the Minister and the Government to fund adequately and to provide a clear policy plan to move towards full accessibility on all public transport.  It is time for us, as a nation, to prioritise the transition to a fully accessible public transport system for all and to put in place the resources necessary to deliver this as soon as is practicably possible.<\/p><p>Accountability too needs to be embedded into the very core functioning of our public transport system to ensure, for example, that there is redress for passengers in the event of stranding or other instances of poor or inaccessible service.<\/p><p>Other key recommendations in the report include equal access.  The committee calls on the Government to fund adequately and provide a clear policy plan to move towards full accessibility on all public transport, including details of funding breakdowns and project timelines.<\/p><p>Ultimately, a measure of achieving the policy ideal of equal access to public transport for all is the extent to which passengers with disabilities can undertake unplanned travel.  We must remove barriers to spontaneous travel for people with disabilities, such as requiring passengers to give advance notice of travel, by ensuring that the necessary accessibility infrastructure and assistance is available without pre-booking.<\/p><p>Accessibility requirements of people with disabilities must be a core consideration in the decision-making process for all public transport planning, funding and development.  Mobility for people with disabilities must be looked at on a whole of journey basis, meaning that the focus needs to be on ensuring accessibility from door to door rather than bus stop to bus stop.<\/p><p>To accomplish this, accessibility information on route linkages between public transport locations must be provided to passengers.  Providing details of step-free routes on journey planners will enable wheelchair users and passengers with mobility impairments to plan their journeys in advance.<\/p> <p> Our committee recommends the establishment of a single point of access hub to provide travel information and journey planning across transport modalities.  Vital to this is a dedicated customer service contact point using phone, text messaging, email and live chat to address specific queries in relation to accessibility for passengers with disabilities.  This information should be provided across a range of formats, including mobile apps, accessible leaflets, subtitled audiovisual content and Irish Sign Language videos.  As part of this centralised hub, the committee recommends the establishment of a clear customer feedback pathway on barriers to accessing public transport across all modes.  This contact hub should be responsive to passengers, with clear and transparent protocols for addressing the feedback or complaints received.  In the interest of monitoring performance, our committee also recommends that data should be collected to track both the types of complaints received from passengers and the nature of the responses to these complaints, in particular in relation to any actions undertaken to address them.<\/p> <p> A key concern for the committee is to ensure that accessible provision is in place in the event of service disruption, curtailment or cancellation.  That means where a train or bus service is cancelled, any replacement service should be accessible.  In the event that there are changes to the accessibility status of services, for example if an accessible bus service is replaced by an inaccessible service, these changes should be clearly communicated to all passengers.  Moreover, if it is not possible for operational reasons to source an accessible replacement option in the event of disrupted train or bus journeys, wheelchair accessible taxis should be provided by the relevant operator to facilitate passengers to complete their journeys.<\/p> <p> An important part of the process of achieving a fully accessible public transport system rests on developing performance measures to assess accessibility standards across transport modes, operators, infrastructure and facilities.  By monitoring these performance metrics against a baseline audit of public transport accessibility, we will be able to track the extent to which accessible public transport is being delivered across transport modes, operators and locations.  Ultimately, accountability must be embedded into the heart of public transport delivery.  Transport operators must have a formal obligation to deliver an accessible service, with sanctions applicable if they fail to deliver an adequate service.  For example, if an operator fails to provide an accessible service where a passenger has pre-booked a journey or if an operator fails to provide an adequate service thereby stranding passengers on trains with no means to embark, that operator must provide redress.<\/p> <p> The committee takes this body of work and important policy report very seriously.  I assure the House that the committee will not countenance the report gathering dust on a shelf, in particular within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Following the commitment he gave to us, we expect the Minister to come before the committee every six months to brief members in detail on the implementation measures initiated by his Department and other relevant Departments in respect of each of the committee's recommendations.  Periodic review of the progress of the Department in implementing these measures will ensure that transparency and accountability are embedded at the heart of our transport policy.  The Minister can expect an invitation from the committee to appear before us for the first update.  We look forward enormously to that first progress report.<\/p> <p> Before I conclude, I pay tribute to Senator Dolan on behalf of the joint committee for his input into this report.  Senator Dolan, who is with us in the Chamber this evening, is a tireless advocate for the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland and when he raised this issue with the joint committee just over a year ago, we had no hesitation whatsoever in agreeing it was one the committee must prioritise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100043#UU01300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550768700,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Before I do anything else, I echo Deputy O'Dowd's words of gratitude to Senator Dolan for the unique perspective he has brought to the Oireachtas on the disability issue.  He and his assistant, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Delaney, have highlighted and made all of us far more aware of the disability issue in recent times.  The fact that the report has been issued is a tribute to Senator Dolan and his office and to the rising awareness of disabilities in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the motion on the joint committee's report on the accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities, following its launch on 14 November 2018.  This time last year, I had the opportunity to engage with Members of both Houses when I appeared before the joint committee during the series of hearings it was holding at that time.  In addition to the publication of the committee's report, there have been a number of positive developments in the past year that I would like briefly to outline to the House.  In February 2018, I outlined how I had been particularly struck since becoming a Minister by the personal experiences related to me in my meetings with people with disabilities who use public transport.  I have had wide consultation with members of the disability community, many of whom have contributed to the report we are discussing here tonight, as well as with disability representative bodies striving to make an impact.  Following those discussions, I advised the committee that I had decided that no public transport company under the remit of my Department would in future function without a minimum of one board member with personal knowledge and experience of the needs and difficulties of people with disabilities who use public transport.  Following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service, I was pleased to be joined at a press conference in August last year by the newly appointed directors of those companies.  These were Diarmuid Corry from Bus &Eacute;ireann, Liam O'Rourke from the CI&Eacute; Group, Kevin Kelly from the National Transport Authority, Suzy Byrne from Irish Rail and Elaine Howley from Dublin Bus.  Members will be familiar with Mr. Padraic Moran who appeared before the joint committee during its hearings and who I have met on a number of occasions in relation to public transport issues.  Last year, I appointed Mr. Moran to the board of Sport Ireland, also following an open competition run by PAS. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to public transport infrastructure and facilities, it is worth reiterating that accessibility features, such as wheelchair accessibility and audiovisual aids, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage and that newer systems, such as Luas, are fully accessible.  Looking to the future, investment in public transport will be accelerated under the national development plan, NDP, to support the development of an integrated, accessible and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are planned under the NDP over the period to 2027, including BusConnects for Ireland's cities, MetroLink, priority elements of the DART expansion programme and sustainable projects, including cycling and walking.  In line with recommendations in the committee's report and as with all new and recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design.  The real challenge, as I have noted previously, relates to upgrading older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible for people with disabilities.  The difficulties and frustrations experienced by people with disabilities using such legacy infrastructure, including our Victorian-era train stations, were outlined very vividly during the committee's hearings.  Given the importance of the accessibility retrofitting programme in this regard, the Department was granted a trebling of the funding provided for the programme to almost &euro;28 million for the period 2018 to 2021.<\/p><p>The additional funding for the retrofit programme is facilitating the continued roil-out of programmes to install accessible bus stops on regional and rural services, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for more wheelchair accessible vehicles, WAVs, in the taxi fleet.  I am pleased that the 2019 allocation is &euro;7 million, which represents an increase on the figure of &euro;4 million last year.  Under the NDP, there will also be a continued investment programme to fund the retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to enhance accessibility.<\/p> <p> I will update the House on some of the accessibility developments taking place in the different public transport sectors.  Under the accessibility retrofit programme, last year &euro;1 million was provided for railway station accessibility upgrades.  That figure has been increased to &euro;3 million this year.  With increased funding from 2019, it is envisaged that larger projects will be undertaken at railway stations, including the installation of lifts and bridges to allow easy access across track platforms for wheelchair users.<\/p> <p> One of the primary difficulties faced by people with disabilities is meeting the requirement to give advance notice of intention to travel.  Members will be aware that people with disabilities repeatedly raise this issue and the difficulties it causes for them in trying to live their daily lives.  Following the completion of a six-month pilot project in 2018, Irish Rail reduced the period of advance notice from 24 hours to four for people with a disability who required assistance to use DART services.  The company is also rolling out the reduced notice period on the Maynooth and Northern commuter lines.  While this reduction is very welcome, it is not where we want to be and Irish Rail plans to further reduce the timescale until it is ultimately eliminated.<\/p> <p> As regards long distance rail services, Irish Rail is training customer service officers, CSOs, for deployment on all inter-city routes, which will mean that at all stops services with a CSO on board will be able to ensure ramp assistance is available.  The full complement of CSOs is expected to be trained and deployed on all inter-city services in 2019.  As a result, this development will eliminate the requirement for advance notice on such inter-city train services.  I allocated additional funding in 2018 to Irish Rail for the development of a new smartphone app to address some of the key communication breakdowns that occur when providing assistance for persons with disabilities.  I had the opportunity to discuss this development before the committee last December.  The company intends to deploy the app during 2019.<\/p> <p> As I outlined to the committee previously, 100% of the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets are wheelchair accessible, as well as approximately 86% of Bus &Eacute;ireann coaches which are wheelchair accessible by lift.  Our policy for quite some time has been that all new buses purchased by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann for urban centres must be low floor, wheelchair accessible vehicles.  The number of Bus &Eacute;ireann accessible vehicles will increase as more of its coach fleet is replaced with accessible vehicles during 2019.  Another concern raised by wheelchair users relates to the provision of dedicated wheelchair spaces on urban buses.  As a result of this concern, all of the Dublin Bus fleet purchased in the past few years has both a dedicated wheelchair space and a dedicated buggy space.<\/p> <p> While all Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann bus stops in regional cities are fully accessible, we must acknowledge, as the committee's report identifies, that there is a shortage of accessible bus stops in rural and regional areas.  The long-term objective is to install a wheelchair accessible bus stop in every town in Ireland.  This is being rolled out on a route by route basis, with Dublin to Donegal and Dublin to Letterkenny routes being focused on initially.  While this is a longer term objective, in the shorter term the NTA intends to provide an accessible bus stop, in both directions, in all 43 towns nationwide that have a population in excess of 5,000 people by 2021, which will result in 86 accessible bus stops.<\/p> <p> In addition to the phasing out of the requirement to give advance notice while travelling on long distance train services, the House will pleased to know that the requirement for advance notification will also be phased out on regional or commuter PS0 bus services, beginning this year.  This is resulting from the new single deck buses to be used on PS0 commuter routes up to 50 km.  The new vehicles will allow wheelchair users to board with normal ramp access, thereby replacing the high floor type coach on such routes which requires an external wheelchair lift and advance notice.  The first of the new buses are expected to enter service in the middle of this year.<\/p> <p> Another concern for people with disabilities which is also addressed in the report arises from problems with on-board audio and visual announcements on both buses and trains.  Since 2015 all of Bus &Eacute;ireann's new fleet has been fitted with high definition, HD, multimedia screens that have the capability to show route progress information, next stop information and expected arrival times.  However, before this system can become operational, all of the approximately 6,000 bus stops nationwide on the network need to be renamed, using a standard naming criterion, in both the English and Irish languages.  The NTA, in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann, has been working on the short common name, SCN, project and it is anticipated that the project will be completed nationwide during 2019.  Separately, the NTA is undertaking this task with all other transport operators.<\/p> <p> One of the success stories which tends to get overlooked is the services provided by private bus operators under the rural transport programme which operate under the Local Link brand.  Local Link services have expanded in recent years in line with an increase in funding which has grown from &euro;12.2 million in 2016 to almost &euro;20 million in 2018 and 2019.  The NTA advises that 80% of the fleet in use on Local Link services is wheelchair accessible.  Action 254 of the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development commits to ensuring Local Link vehicles are accessible, having regard to all passenger needs.  The objective is to achieve at least 95% fully accessible trips by the end of next year.<\/p> <p> Since the introduction of a taxi wheelchair accessible vehicle grants scheme in 2014, the number of WAVs in the fleet increased from 860 in 2014 to 2,201 at the end of October 2018, which represents 10.6% of the total fleet.  This is the highest ever level of wheelchair accessible vehicles in the small public service vehicle fleet.  It is intended to continue the grants scheme in 2019.<\/p> <p> As I outlined to the House previously, we are conducting a review of public transport policy.  As part of the review, my Department will be undertaking a public consultation process on different aspects of public transport, including the provision of accessible public transport.  I urge members of the public and especially representatives of the disability community to contribute their views to the process.<\/p> <p> I will conclude with what I hope the House will agree is a very significant development.  It is the NTA&rsquo;s decision to create a new position of transport accessibility manager.  Against the background of the delivery by the NTA of the largest ever investment in public transport under the national development plan and its role in seeking to continually expand and improve the network of public transport services across the State, it is critical that the needs of customers with disabilities be to the forefront in the design and development of public transport infrastructure and services by the NTA.  The role and responsibilities of the transport accessibility manager will be wide-ranging and include establishing a formal engagement process with key disability representative groups; developing and monitoring an improvement plan for existing services; assisting in the development of the retrofit programme and ensuring accessibility is built into all new public transport infrastructure; co-ordinating the accessibility programmes of transport operators and their access officers and establishing a contact and complaints handling system for users of public transport who have a disability.  The position of transport accessibility manager has been publicly advertised by the NTA and the process to fill the post is under way.<\/p> <p> I again acknowledge the work of the committee in producing the report, with all those who contributed to it, particularly the people with a disability who shared their experiences of using public transport.  In addition, I acknowledge the work the transport companies and the NTA are undertaking in seeking to improve accessibility for people with disabilities to the public transport system.  I take the opportunity to record my acknowledgement and appreciation of the co-operation of the employees in the transport companies and their staff associations, including the NBRU and SIPTU, in helping to make public transport accessible for people with disabilities.  Their support has been immense and immeasurable.  I particularly thank Mr. Dermot O'Leary for his constant championing of the cause of people with disabilities.  I notice he is present in the Visitors Gallery for this debate.  I welcome him and his colleagues.  It is a great tribute to him and others that while there might be political differences and differences between management and employees, they are transcended where people with disabilities are concerned.  They cause people to discard their prejudices and personal interests and work together for people with disabilities, for which I applaud and salute them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100044#VV00200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550769300,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I acknowledge all of the people who made submissions, particularly those who made presentations to the committee.  Some of the people who made presentations to the committee did so at some discomfort and inconvenience to themselves.<\/p><p>They shared very personal stories and first-hand experience with us as committee members, which very much enabled us to publish this report.  I also acknowledge Senator John Dolan and his assistant, Ciar&aacute;n Delaney, for their championing of this and ensuring that this report came to fruition.<\/p> <p> The Minister quite rightly says there has been progress, and it would be wrong not to acknowledge it.  The appointment of people with a disability to the various State boards is a welcome development and undoubtedly will ensure that any decisions taken at board level in the future will reflect the needs of people with disabilities.  What was reinforced to me as a committee member over the hearings was that there are vast differences in the experiences of disability and that it is therefore important to provide a diverse and flexible array of supports to cater for people with the varying disabilities and varying levels of disability.  There are mobility issues, people with restricted and limited sight and people with psychological and intellectual disabilities.  Speaking of intellectual disabilities, I acknowledge the work that has been done on the promotion of the \"just a minute\", JAM, card which the various bodies need to acknowledge, take on board and implement.  Quite often not every disability is obvious to the person one is dealing with, and we need to acknowledge the diverse levels of disability out there.<\/p> <p> Accessibility is a precondition for persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully and equally in society.  Without access to the physical environment, from transportation to information, communication and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, persons with disabilities would not have equal opportunities to participate in their respective societies.  I am thinking of two contributions from witnesses to the committee.  Dr. Margaret Kennedy told the transport committee that she was left at the end of a very long platform at Heuston Station in the dark, with not a soul in sight, and became very scared.  About 20 minutes or half an hour later a single cleaner arrived and Dr. Kennedy was rescued.  This incident in the not-too-distant past is a very strong indictment of a State service.<\/p> <p> Another witness, Alannah Murray, told the committee she had missed out on business meetings that could have secured her a job.  She stated, \"I have had to miss appointments because I have showed up for my pre-booked bus only to be told that there has been a mis-communication and I will be unable to travel as the bus has not been properly adapted to allow me onto it.\"  This is simply not good enough and again reinforces the need to address this issue to ensure that people with a disability can lead normal lives and integrate into society just as we have the benefit of doing daily.  None of us in this Chamber must warn a company when we want to take a bus or give 24 hours' notice if we want to take a train.  We must strive to ensure that just because someone has a disability does not mean he or she should not be able to lead a normal life and get around in the very same way as people who do not have a disability.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred in his speech to rail accessibility and the increase from &euro;1 million to &euro;3 million provided for railway station accessibility upgrades this year.  How many stations will this address?  That is the crucial point.  We need to know how many stations will become more accessible with the increase in funding.  Is this level of funding enough to make all stations accessible?  I do not think so.  I do not know.  The Minister made reference to the urban bus services, and that was welcome, but he forgot to mention the rural bus services.  Only approximately 40% of our bus stops across rural Ireland have been surveyed.  Of those that have been surveyed, the majority are yet to become accessible.  We do not have them all surveyed so we do not even know how many we need to improve.<\/p> <p> This report identifies 16 specific recommendations.  Due to the short time I have, I will just allude to a number of them.  One is the review of the free travel scheme.  This is urgently needed.  Free travel is currently made available to senior citizens, and I do not begrudge them that at all, but people with a disability are only eligible for the free travel scheme if they are in receipt of disability allowance.  I know a person in my constituency who is on a payment similar to disability allowance and was signed off work due to disability.  However, because he has a public service pension, he does not qualify for disability allowance, and because of this he is not entitled to free travel, despite the fact that he has severe mobility and medical issues that require him to travel to Dublin very frequently.  I have raised this anomaly with the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and I am raising it with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport this evening.  It needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies raised the issue of commercial bus services at the committee meetings.  It is proposed to ensure that no commercial bus operator should be allowed to provide a service that does not meet the same standard the Department imposes on Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  This is not currently the case, and that can be addressed quite quickly.<\/p> <p> I like recommendation No. 15 which proposes to establishment of key performance indicators in order that when State companies or commercial operators providing a State service fail in their duty of care, there are consequences in the form of financial penalties, which can then be passed on to the people the companies have let down in the form of compensation.<\/p> <p> Two other issues not in the report need to be highlighted.  One is a major failing of this Government and the previous Government.  I refer to the motorised transport grant, which was suspended almost six years ago.  It is closed to new entrants but is critically important, particularly to people who live in areas where no public transport is available.  No matter when this matter is raised, whether on the Order of Business or during Priority Questions or Other Questions, it seems to be \"imminent\".  That imminency has lasted the best part of five or six years.  It cannot go on any longer.  While this is not the Minister's responsibility, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport he needs to get in touch with the relevant Minister and ensure that this new scheme is opened up to new applicants without further delay.<\/p> <p> Another area where the Government is failing very badly is the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  I do not know whether other Members have experience of this, but certainly in the past two years the conditions and eligibility criteria that have been set down have become extremely strict.  I know a young man who is only kept out of a wheelchair by his own will, and he has been refused on two separate occasions in this regard.  The scheme is not fit for purpose.  It needs to be reviewed, and I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that this is done.<\/p> <p> As the Chairman of the committee and the Minister said, there is a six-month review.  The Minister will be invited before the committee at the end of April to give an update on every one of the 16 recommendations.  I will be there, as will other members, because there has very much been cross-party collaboration on this.  We want to see improvements, and the Minister is the person in the position to deliver on these improvements.  I hope he will honour his commitment and I look forward to welcoming him before the committee at the end of April to review all the recommendations that have been put before him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100045#WW00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550770500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome the report of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, which sets out a number of recommendations to improve accessibility to all public transport services for people with disabilities.  The recommendations will go some way to improving access but they may not go far enough in improving the situation for people with disabilities living in rural Ireland.  The number one barrier that people with disabilities face in places such as County Donegal is the lack of public transport.  Measures in the report, therefore, while well-intentioned, are not suitably targeted to the reality of living in a rural constituency if one has a disability.  Nevertheless, I support the implementation of the report's recommendations in the hope that improvements in rural public transport will be a consideration in the context of all public transport planning, funding and development.  While this will require resources, including time and monetary investment, that is what is required if we are to be a country that prides itself on notions of equity and equality.  Let us not forget that in the context of our climate action obligations and our necessary transition to a low-carbon economy, we will need greater public transport infrastructure throughout the country and, in particular, in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  People with disabilities living in rural Ireland face an inordinate number of barriers in accessing public transport.  County Donegal has no rail or motorway, which makes the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet a vital part of our transport infrastructure.  For a person with a disability coming from Donegal, a number of gaps in the planning, funding and development of rural public transport lead to significant service interruptions, journeys being cancelled or delayed, or people being unable to attempt a journey at all.  There have been recent improvements, however, particularly in the area of upgrading bus stops to make them wheelchair accessible.  I have been in contact with the National Transport Authority for years in respect of the provision of wheelchair accessible bus stops in Donegal.  While I acknowledge that the bus stops have been successful, they are not enough.<\/p>  <p>  To emphasise this point, I will read aloud an account of Frank Larkin, a disability activist from County Donegal.  It is important that the voices of those affected by the issues being debated are heard.  The journey from Donegal to Dublin is straightforward for me as an able-bodied person.  I get in my car and drive uninterrupted for four hours to Killybegs numerous times a week.  For Frank Larkin, however, as we will hear from his own words, it is an entirely different scenario.  He told me that he would not use Bus &Eacute;ireann ever again.  He said he had not used the service for some time because he had too many bad experiences.  He went on to say there had been improvements in that the route is now accessible but that all bus options should be accessible rather than needing to be booked 24 or 48 hours in advance and that it is impossible to make spontaneous trips as circumstances stand.  He said disability awareness and equality training would definitely be required by staff due to the attitude of some to people with disabilities, even though they say they receive training.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting Frank Larkin&rsquo;s point, the Irish Wheelchair Association recently carried out a survey which found that seven out of ten people with disabilities were dissatisfied with the service offered by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  On Frank Larkin&rsquo;s point about the advance booking required for journeys, I am glad the report recommends the rolling-out of accessibility services and facilities without prior booking.  How we achieve this will fall on the Government's lap and whether it is content with increased spending in this area, but transport companies also need to get on board.  It is clear that we need to focus on transport companies and how they deliver their services.  It appears that more intensive training is required for service providers to help eradicate stigma.<\/p>  <p>  In a previous report, the National Disability Authority, NDA, stated: &ldquo;Ease of access also depends on the attitudes of the community as well as those transport staff.&rdquo;  We need to contemplate that and take on the NTA's recommendation that the Government develop a public awareness programme and a staff training programme for customer care.  The report recommended that, where possible, the training should be conducted by people with a disability.  I am happy with the report&rsquo;s call for minimum standards of accessibility to be set and monitored by a statutory agency with powers to impose sanctions on transport companies that fail to assist people with disabilities.  I also welcome the report&rsquo;s recommendation that the NDA be given powers to monitor and enforce access for people with disabilities, and I hope it will be followed through.  I acknowledge that disabled people are on the boards of the transport companies, which is welcome, but much more needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  Greater joined-up thinking is required among the various Departments to increase access for people with disabilities.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection must reflect the need for greater accessibility by providing the necessary income supports for all people with disabilities.  Some social welfare payments, such as disability benefit, do not cover the free travel pass, but anyone with a disability, whether temporary or permanent, should be offered a free travel pass until he or she no longer needs it. Let us not forget that barriers to transport create barriers in other parts of life.  For example, they can restrict the options for a person attending a third level institution or a person&rsquo;s access to the job market.  As we know too well, it also restricts a person's access to healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth measuring how Ireland stands up to Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which we recently ratified.  The convention explicitly states, &ldquo;To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications\".  While we have made progress, we have a long way to go and I hope that we will keep going in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100047#YY00100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1550770500,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the report.  I commend the Chairperson, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, and the rest of the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on their work in holding hearings on accessibility to public transport and presenting us, as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd noted in his introduction, with the \"experiences of disadvantage, exclusion and unequal treatment\" endured by citizens with disabilities, which is a significant cohort of Irish society.  When reading the report, I was struck by the comment of our colleague, Senator Dolan, who represents the Disability Federation of Ireland, in late 2017 that people with disabilities \"do not have their basic right to free movement&rdquo;.   That is a profound statement on the level of public transport and all other types of transport in the country.<\/p>  <p> Other comments on public transport accessibility by witnesses to the committee also strongly challenged public transport operators and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to fulfil urgently the accessibility principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was ratified by the Oireachtas last year.  The 16 recommendations of the report seem to be a comprehensive overview of the steps Ireland urgently needs to take to implement full equal access as defined in recommendation 1 of the report.  The measurement of performance by transport operators and all the agencies, such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, and so on, in recommendation 8 and the role of the National Disability Authority in recommendation 14 are also important.  The Minister needs to respond with whatever legislation is necessary to provide for that measurement and to hold people to account.  If necessary, sanctions should be applied to ensure that the NTA will place its responsibility to citizens with disabilities at the core of its monitoring of public and private transport companies.  As the report notes, we are speaking about a significant cohort of our society, given that in the 2016 census, 643,131 people indicated they had a disability.  Worryingly, the unemployment rate among persons with disability was reported to be higher than 26%.  As Deputy Pringle has outlined, the lack of disability is almost certainly a factor in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In preparing for the debate, I contacted Ms Joan Carthy, the outstanding advocacy officer of the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, whom I welcome along with her colleagues to the Public Gallery.  Ms Carthy helpfully sent me a copy of the results of the IWA&rsquo;s national transport survey of October 2018, for which it had well over 500 respondents from 28 counties.  Some 66% of those respondents indicated they use public transport, although some of those who said they did not said they used taxis.  Trains and the DART were the commonest form of transport used, while people who used taxis usually had to book them in advance and were rarely able to book an accessible taxi.  As the Minister noted at the committee, those seeking an accessible taxi must usually give at least 24 hours' notice, which is a significant issue for citizens with disability and transport accessibility.<\/p><p>A large number of people, 32%, used Dublin Bus weekly, with 22% using it daily but if companions travelling together are both in wheelchairs, they are unable to get on the same bus because of the space for just one wheelchair.  There is a long-standing complaint about buggies being placed in the wheelchair space.  It is disappointing that 43% of respondents reported being refused access to the bus because of the ramp being broken in 24% of cases, a buggy in the wheelchair spot in 33% of cases, or another wheelchair user already on board in 24% of cases.  The Luas seemed to get good ratings from people who responded to the survey.<\/p> <p> Some 64% of respondents to the survey said that they had to give notice to their local station if they were to travel by train, including the DART.  In my constituency, I have had to make many representations to the Minister in the past few years about when the lifts are malfunctioning in Howth Junction-Donaghmede and a key station on the northern part of the DART becomes totally inaccessible for a citizen with disability.<\/p> <p> The availability of accessible taxis is low.  Since 2010, new licences were only granted for wheelchair accessible vehicles but just 8% of the small public service vehicle, SPSV, fleet is wheelchair accessible.  I was dismayed in 2017 that only &euro;2 million was available under the public transport accessibility grants programme.  The Minister said that that has now expanded to &euro;7 million, if he was referring to that specifically.<\/p> <p> Clongriffin DART station in my constituency was one of the first stations to become staffless earlier this month because of the new system of the 13 hubs, and will be one of the first stations not to be manned.  It is said that the rationale behind these unmanned stations is that it will allow staff at the hubs to travel between stations.  Citizens with disability who use public transport have grave concerns about how and whether that system will work.<\/p> <p> I warmly welcome the report and acknowledge the input of stakeholders including the Disability Federation of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, the Irish Deaf Society, the National Council for the Blind, the IWA and other disability activists.  I am a member of the informal Oireachtas disability group, which was founded and is chaired by our colleague, Senator John Dolan, which has done remarkable work over the past couple of years.  I am also a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and I have tried to ensure that the needs of citizens with disability are input into budget preparations at the earliest possible time.  Making all public transport fully accessible should be a priority, as the Minister rightly says, for the entire Oireachtas and it is something that we can work together to achieve.  Although we have not signed the optional protocol, we have signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  We have grave responsibility in this regard and I hope that it will be discharged.<\/p> <p> I read with great interest the contributions at the committee.  It is somewhat disappointing to read what was said by the Minister and the CEOs, Mr. Ray Coyne of Dublin Bus, Mr. Jim Meade, the director of Irish Rail and Mr. Ray Hernan of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Hernan said that the company are trying to get a balance between \"the commerciality of the situation\" and its overall transport obligations.  That is a ridiculous comment because the point of good public transport is to empower and facilitate every user of transport, including all citizens with disability.<\/p> <p> I welcome the news that the NDA is working with NTA and academics from DIT and Trinity on improved data analysis.  It was disappointing to read some of Ms Anne Graham's contributions, as CEO of the NTA, to the committee.  The CEO should lead the organisation towards 100% accessibility and ask the committee for whatever legislation or resources she needs to make that possible, to monitor what is happening and to ensure that the widest accessibility is available.  She would not give a timeframe for her target.  Some &euro;28 million in budget 2018 was mentioned but during the austerity years it was our most vulnerable citizens, including those with disability, who suffered most.<\/p> <p> I asked the Minister a few years ago about the cost of updating bus stations, and he replied that it would cost &euro;11.5 million, with &euro;79 million for railway works.  He put the figure for fully accessible public infrastructure that he was taking care of at between &euro;100 million and &euro;200 million.  That seems a reasonable sum.  Many of us in this House voted against putting &euro;500 million in the rainy day fund at this juncture.  One area that we were thinking about was the disability sector.  That is achievable and the Minister should work for it.<\/p> <p> In recent correspondence, the IWA highlighted a number of disturbing issues, for example, emerging problems with the new Go-Ahead buses which have taken over 10% of radial Dublin Bus routes, including a number of routes through my own constituency.  It also mentioned problems with the new Waterford intercity fleet.  I hope the representations that have been made about these issues will be dealt with.  I commend the committee and its chair for the outstanding work in developing the report.  I urge the Minister to accept and act on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100047#YY00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550771100,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, I commend the committee and its Chairman on the very important work on this report.  There is no doubt that people with all types of disabilities, including physical, intellectual, learning, hearing, sight, mobility, speech, deafness and mental health issues, do not enjoy access to society on an equal basis with others who do not have a disability.  It is important that we try to level the playing field and ensure that those with a disability have access to the same rights, the opportunity to work, to have a social life and to contribute to society.  With regard to the report and recommendations, I thought it was particularly interesting that the IWA revealed that only 5% of taxis across the country were wheelchair accessible.  That is stunning and while grants are available to taxi drivers to increase accessibility for wheelchairs, they are not sufficient to incentivise taxi drivers to do so.  It is important that the Department examines that.  We know from surveys that are done that 80% of people with disabilities travel as car passengers because they cannot access public transport.<\/p>  <p>  That is difficult, especially for those who live in rural isolation where there is no public transport and who rely on a family member to drive them places.  I live in Newbridge, a commuter town, where, increasingly, people have to buy tickets at unstaffed stations.  That is a significant challenge for people with a disability, especially those with intellectual disabilities, who travel alone.  If there is a problem with a ticket machine, which often happens, having human support is very important to disabled people, especially when travelling alone.  We know that previously people with disabilities had an automatic right to have somebody travel with them but this was taken away and there is quite an onerous procedure to get somebody else on a travel pass.  That needs to be looked at.  Having to provide notice 24 hours in advance of travel is completely wrong.<\/p>  <p>  When I am talking about that, I think of the care and work of the people on the internships for people with disabilities here in Leinster House.  I think of Kenny, who travels every day from Kildare town.  I talk to him about the obstacles that he has to go through four days a week to contribute to the work that we are doing.  He is a marvellous young man and indicative of the passion and human spirit that we need to help and support.  I also think of my brother, Cathal, who has Down's syndrome and cannot drive.  Living four miles from the nearest village, Rathangan, he has to rely on my mother or siblings to bring him anywhere.  That is not good enough.<\/p><p> It is interesting that while only 5% of our taxis are not wheelchair accessible, we have an excellent Rural Link service in Kildare.  Alan Kerry does a really good job with the resources he has but national policy dictates that all vehicles in rural transport fleets must be accessible so every bus is accessible.  If we can do that in Rural Link we should be able to incentivise the taxi drivers to do that.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, has denounced the lack of reliable audible announcements on buses, trains and trams.  If someone who is visually impaired cannot hear what the next stop is, he or she is severely disadvantaged.  Sometimes I strain to hear when I am on an unfamiliar route.  The fact that people with travel passes have to pay an extra &euro;5 each way to reserve a seat is wrong.  Those who do not have travel passes do not have to pay.<\/p> <p> There is an anomaly in that many private bus operators do not accept the travel pass.  The Department has to get grips with that.  While there is no doubt that different groups fighting for disability rights believe more training is required for transport employees, and I agree, I have come across some excellent people and they need to be commended.<\/p> <p> There are approximately 5,000 bus stops that cannot be accessed by wheelchair users and there is no way for disabled people to check the position in that regard in advance.  If somebody with a disability is travelling to a place with which he or she is not familiar, he or she will not know until he or she gets there whether he or she will be able to alight from or board a bus.  That is completely wrong.  The isolation of elderly people with disabilities who live in rural areas has been highlighted in every form of research I have read.<\/p> <p> As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, I, along with Deputy Curran, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Deputy Harty, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health, held several meetings and published a report entitled Review of Supports Available to People with Disabilities Transitioning from Education or Training into Employment.  A total of 71% of people with disabilities cannot access employment.  While the reasons are complex - I will not go into them now - it is important to say that transport was included for discussion at all of the hearings we held.  Different agencies dealing with disabilities came before us and we also heard people talk about their lived experience.  When so many people cannot access employment that is absolutely wrong.<\/p> <p> Deputy Troy referred to the now discontinued motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance.  That is very important for young people accessing education and training, apart from all the other myriad reasons.  Prior to Inclusion Ireland's submission for budget 2018 the organisation consulted widely with disabled people and the mobility grant and the motorised transport scheme was one of the issues that arose more significantly than others.  Many said a key priority for them was the reinstatement of this mobility grant.  It has left families in desperate financial distress and many disabled people in rural areas without transport.<\/p> <p> Under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities people have a fundamental human right to full and effective participation and inclusion in society.  That right, however, is of little use if the correct supports are not in place.  Access to public transport absolutely has to be one of those.<\/p> <p> Years ago, the Government rightly stated that people in services and those in institutions should be moved out to live independently and should choose their own support services.  That is very important and I applaud those who have helped to make that happen.  It is a whole different situation, however, when people move into homes.  There are several of them in Rathangan, my home town.  Not having access to public transport is very difficult.  If we want people to be full members of the community within which they live - and everybody has something to contribute to their community - but they do not have access to any type of transport to enable them to be part of a social network or indeed to go to work in that area there is something radically wrong.  We have to empower people with disabilities, give them dignity and respect, and enable them to become full members of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550771700,"counter":480,"content":"<p>This report came out of a series of hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport where the committee heard from interest groups, charities, transport providers, disability activists and transport service users about the challenges of, and possible solutions to, the serious issues faced by people with mobility issues and disabilities in accessing transport.  I thank all those who appeared before the committee for their contributions, particularly those with disabilities who offered us a valuable insight into the challenges and frustrations they experience day in, day out in accessing the most basic of services, transport.  I also acknowledge the transport providers who appeared before the committee for the work they have undertaken to date.  I hope this report will lead to significant progress in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  Transport offers a vital lifeline to people because it allows them access work, education, healthcare services and a social life.  In other words, it facilitates independence.  The report makes some useful recommendations: ensuring equal access to transport is a key issue.  I submitted an amendment to strengthen this recommendation which was accepted.  It calls on the Government to adequately fund and provide a clear policy plan to move towards full accessibility on all public transport, including a breakdown of funding and project timelines.<\/p>  <p>  The report also recommends that the needs of people with disabilities be central to all future transport planning.  Periodic reviews, required targets for providers and research are also recommended.  While the long-term goal is a move to full accessibility on transport the report also makes short-term recommendations.  These include ensuring that passenger information is available in accessible formats on all stages of a journey, ensuring that journey delays and information are visually and audibly available, that there are sufficient staff to assist and enough ramps at train stations.  The committee recommended the establishment of transport hubs that would provide information to transport users should they encounter difficulties or should they require additional information and support, or if they wish to complain about a service.  We hope this will address some of the frustrations expressed by transport users at the committee hearings about cancellations, being unable to access transport, running into difficulties and finding it difficult to access assistance. <\/p>  <p>  The report also recommends improved communications by transport providers in cases of cancelled service or delays and a commitment that they will ensure that disabled passengers are facilitated in cases where replacement services are not suitable for their needs.  The matter of the cost of transport for persons with disabilities is key.  People who are disabled have an increased risk of poverty, some persons with disabilities are reliant on the State and if the State fails them they are in a very vulnerable position.  The report calls for a review of the free travel pass to ensure that all persons with disabilities are entitled to free travel and not just those in receipt of certain State payments.<\/p>  <p>  I also submitted several amendments in respect of the matter of cost.<\/p><p>The amended report now calls on the State finally to implement the transport support scheme.  This scheme was supposed to replace the motorised transport grant and other supports that the State had cut, but it does not appear to be functioning.  The report also highlights the need to ensure that the additional requirements of people with disabilities in rural areas and their additional costs are recognised and taken into account during transport planning.<\/p> <p> A recurring theme at the committee was the frustration experienced by transport users who have to make arrangements days in advance.  If someone wants to take a trip on a Wednesday, he or she has to give notice by Tuesday and if somebody wants to travel at the weekend, he or she has to give 48 hours' notice.  Persons with disabilities are expected to put up with bizarre situations that able-bodied people would find simply unacceptable.  The report recommends that this notice period be done away with by ensuring that all public transport is fully accessible all of the time.<\/p> <p> Along with Government and State companies, commercial operators are also subject to committee recommendations.  We call on them to provide fully accessible services and to fulfil the same requirements as semi-State companies.  This includes Bus &Eacute;ireann's express service, which receives no State funding.  We are calling for higher standards for commercial operators to be implemented by the NTA.  This will be paid for from the operators' profits.  We also call for such standards to be requirements for public service obligation, PSO, and other State transport tenders.<\/p> <p> The report also makes a series of recommendations regarding accessible taxis.  We want to see an increase in the number of accessible taxis and requirements on companies tendering for State transport contracts.  We are calling for reporting services to address reports that some accessible taxis will not provide services to wheelchair users.<\/p> <p> The recommendations, however, are only as strong as the political will behind them.  In order to ensure that real progress is made on the issue, we need real commitments from Government and Government agencies to ensure that sufficient funding is provided.  While some progress has been made, particularly within Dublin Bus, many of the more complex issues with regard to public transport still need to be addressed.  Recent decisions, such as the decision to remove staff from train stations, must be reversed as they are causing undue hardship for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> It is hard to have confidence in this Government, however, when its previous form shows very little in the way of action.  The Government made a commitment to ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This shows that while the Government might appear to be on board, in practice it is unwilling to grant people with disabilities their full rights.<\/p> <p> The final three recommendations deal with accountability and monitoring.  This is vital because without these recommendations the report runs the risk of sitting on a shelf gathering dust.  The key part of these recommendations is the imposition of sanctions on non-compliant service providers if they fail to provide an adequate service by, for example, leaving passengers stranded or refusing to take a booking.  Other key parts are the provision of redress for such passengers, the establishment of accountability measures for the NTA including the devising of key performance indicators for various aspects of transport accessibility and ensuring monitoring and the publication of quarterly figures detailing provision failures.  Closely linked to this is recommendation No. 16, which calls on the Government to provide regular updates to the committee as laid out in various Government policy documents.  These documents should include detailed timelines, implementation status and outcomes.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will report to the committee every six months on the progress in implementing each of the 15 recommendations in the report.<\/p> <p> I look forward to seeing real progress on this report.  All of the people who contributed to this report and the committee members are determined to get things right.  Unless there is Government will behind this, we will have wasted our time.  Let us, in 2019, make sure that equality is central to everything we do from now on.  I look forward to seeing progress on this report.  The only way this will happen is if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport prioritises it.  This report should be taken into consideration in the planning and development of new infrastructure and in all efforts to make transport more accessible.  We must accelerate the rate of progress to ensure that our society is inclusive and to break down the barriers that people with disabilities currently face every single day.<\/p> <p> I have a couple of minutes left.  Deputy Broughan had raised the issue of the new fleet-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100049#AAA00200","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550772300,"counter":482,"content":"<p>We have very little time left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100050#BBB00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1550772300,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

These are silly things that were flagged up in advance and which are now causing problems.  This sort of thing needs to be rectified.  It was brought to my attention by Mr. Michael Doyle.  It is causing a serious problem and represents a regression in services for people with disabilities in County Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100050#BBB00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1550772300,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome the report and thank the committee for all its work.  I have been looking over the recommendations.  Some of them are very good and they are all very relevant.  However, since I have come into this D&aacute;il we have been through several strikes and disputes with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and the Luas.  These have usually related to pay claims by the workers or, in the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, to the defence of their jobs because many of them were to be let go.  In the course of debates on these issues, the Minister, Deputy Ross, made it very clear that he does not have a chequebook or deep pockets to deal with public transport.  There are some great recommendations in the report such as having every bus stop immediately adjacent to a kerb, ensuring that access is available and that all ramps are working at every station, ensuring that all signage is working and that signage is provided in the Irish language, engaging with research, and undertaking research with people with disabilities.  It goes on and on with some very good, innovative and necessary ideas to deliver real equality and real and proper access for people with disabilities.  The first page of the recommendations recognises that achieving a fully accessible public transport system will require resources including time and monetary investment before recommending that a number of measures be taken to improve accessibility of transport in the short term.  I have to wonder how we are going to be fixed in the long term because Deputy Ross does not have a chequebook or deep pockets.<\/p><p>As we pointed out repeatedly during those debates in this House, the subvention given to public transport by the Irish State is appallingly low.  It is one of the lowest in Europe and our subventions for cities are also among the lowest in Europe.  People with disabilities will be among those who will be most affected by that subvention being so extraordinary low and by our hurtling towards more and more privatisation of public transport.  With regard to the area in which I live, cuts to the frequency of buses in Ballyfermot, each of which only has one wheelchair space, means longer and longer waits for people who need wheelchair accessible buses.  The point was made earlier by Deputy Broughan that two people with wheelchair needs cannot travel together because there are not enough dedicated spaces on buses for them.  The drivers do not have the authority to enforce the requirement that those spaces be kept free.  One does not want to end up in a situation in which passengers are fighting with each other over whether prams get priority over wheelchairs.<\/p><p>We have an appallingly bad service generally, but it is even worse for people with disabilities.  I want to read a letter I got yesterday:<\/p><blockquote>I am writing to you in regard to the report above that is to be discussed in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  I am a wheelchair user from Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal.  I have applied to do a degree in Applied Sports with Business in Sligo IT.  Bus &Eacute;ireann customer service has told Sligo IT that it has no accessibility on the route between Ballyshannon and Sligo.<br \/><br \/>I would like to ask that you will speak on my behalf tomorrow.  I survive [and I suppose one suffers on it as well] on disability allowance and do not have a car.  I rely on the good will of family members to take me shopping, to the doctors, to physiotherapy etc. as do lots of other people in my situation.<br \/><br \/>Under the Equality Acts 2000-2004, I should not be discriminated against, I should be able to use public transport to meet my needs, in this case I would like an accessible bus to be put on Route 480 Ballyshannon to Sligo return so that I can independently attend college. <br \/><br \/>I have started a petition to achieve this and am trying to highlight the need for accessible transport nationwide. <br \/><br \/>It is unfair that people with disabilities, where the route is accessible have to give 24-48 hour notice to book a place.  Wheelchair users in Ireland are not treated equally and most often hide away in their homes because society has [put up] so many barriers against accessibility.  I hope that [you] will stand up for the people on this human rights issue and equality for all and help bring down the barriers.<\/blockquote><p>That letter is from Vicky Matthews in Ballyshannon.  I read it out because Vicky's situation needs to be repeatedly highlighted in order to remind ourselves of the reason reports like this are designed and the urgency in respect of funding for proper public transport.  On the ideological argument against privatisation, the report states that private bus routes are under no compunction to provide disability access.  That is outrageous.  There are many private companies that have a licence to go up and down on our main routes without providing disability access or wheelchair spaces.<\/p> <p> There is also the question of what is actually happening at the moment.  We are running campaigns in many areas to stop the destaffing of DART stations.  They are taking the security and the human beings out of DART and railway stations because they are trying to make things ticket and machine-ready so people can just move in and out without staff.  That is a crazy manoeuvre when we are trying to facilitate people with disabilities.  We have to stop destaffing DART and train stations.  Human beings must be accessible to people with disabilities who need them.<\/p> <p> The father of one disabled daughter makes a point to me that frequently the lifts in stations are broken and they often have to call the fire brigade to get them fixed or get people out of them, because the maintenance is so appallingly bad.  Everywhere we turn, the problems mount up in terms of the subvention that is needed to make public transport work properly.  We need more subvention.  We need to end the habitual drive towards privatisation, as if it was going to be the cure for everything.  A cursory glance at what has happened in other countries will show us that it disimproves public transport.  We need more and improved public transport with real access and real equality.  That starts with real investment not just in the quality but also in the quantity of public transport that is available for all, in particular for people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100050#BBB00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550772900,"counter":486,"content":"<p>It is absolutely imperative that we support the actions recommended in this report to fix the barriers to accessibility within Ireland's transportation system.  At present, those in the disabled community are being treated as second class citizens.  Due to the fact that public transportation has not been made accessible for their use, their freedom has been limited and many have been forced to live a life of isolation.  While the needs of the disabled community are incredibly diverse, we have a responsibility to these citizens, as their representatives, to build the infrastructure of Ireland to meet their needs.<\/p><p>Some of the key recommendations within this report include the following: providing passenger information in accessible formats, especially when there are cancellations, interruptions or delays; confirming that emergency procedures provide accessible evacuation routes; supplying taxi tokens for individuals when there are no public transportation options available; and making accessible facilities available without prior booking.  This problem of inaccessible public transportation has become an issue of human rights.  Disabled citizens of Ireland should be able to move freely without compromising their safety and dignity.  Spontaneity is one of the greatest privileges stripped from the disabled community within our current system because they must book aid services at least 24 hours ahead of time.  Granted, the DART has now reduced that time to four hours, but that still does not change the problem that individuals cannot access services when they need to make an unplanned trip, such as in the case of needing to visit a family member in hospital.  Life often does not go to plan and forcing these individuals to know when they are going to need to use public transport strips them of their ability to live autonomous lifestyles.  This problem could be fixed if funding were to be allocated to ensure each station is always manned with trained staff members who can make each individual's journey as seamless as possible. <\/p><p>The services we are pledging to provide must also be implemented with consequences for the transportation providers, if the services fail to work in the way they are intended.  The Labour Party disability chair, Mick Keegan, gives an example of this when he says:<\/p><blockquote>A lot of money has been invested in making kerbs high enough to allow wheelchair access to Dublin Buses.  We need drivers to pull in so people can actually use them.  We need to work on road design to make sure this is always possible and we need to improve training of drivers.<\/blockquote><p>There are also other experiences reported where disabled passengers have pressed the emergency assistance buttons on the train and found them broken or ignored.  These experiences are abhorrent and unacceptable.  The staff who are failing to complete their duties must be held accountable and each station must ensure that there are enough employees always on duty to aid disabled individuals in need of assistance.  When stations are left unstaffed, this issue becomes a problem of public safety for all citizens.  Individuals who frequently experience horrendous conditions while travelling quickly become disheartened and frightened when it comes to their ability to travel, so they will be much less likely to want to try it again. <\/p><p>Beyond making this system accessible for individuals with disabilities, the public transportation system should also be welcoming and encouraging of their use of the system.  When people feel their use of provided services is resented by staff because of the extra work such services require, yet another barrier is constructed between the disabled community and their freedom.  The best way for this report to have its desired impact is for the committee to continue to work hand in hand with the disabled community to ensure that the needs of their diverse community are met. <\/p><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to contribute.  I congratulate the joint committee members and Chair on their work.  I am the spokesperson on transport for the Labour Party but we do not have a position on that committee.  The presentation of committee reports in the D&aacute;il Chamber on a Thursday evening is a great development and it is very important that it continues.  I also congratulate Senator John Dolan as a key influencer in all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100051#CCC00200","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1550772900,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I join Deputy Brendan Ryan in commending our colleague from the other place, Senator John Dolan, for his sterling work on behalf of a number of bodies in this space.  I also thank our signers this evening for communicating our contributions to those outside.  I welcome the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities.  Much has been said and I do not want to repeat it.  I acknowledge, as others have done to some degree, the significant advances that have been made in the last ten or 20 years in respect of the provision of facilities with people with disabilities and special needs in mind.  One of the great leaders in this has been Dublin Bus.  I raised an issue last year in respect of the livery of Dublin Bus.  The company took great pride in the depth and breadth of its public consultation on the design and colour of Dublin Bus vehicles.  The colours are designed specifically with those who have visual impairments in mind, so they know from a long distance away that a Dublin Bus vehicle is on its way, as all of us do.  These are small but significant gestures to people with disabilities.  Clearly we need more, and I will come to that.  Certainly compared with 20 years ago, the fleet itself has been enhanced considerably.  I always find Dublin Bus drivers to be exceptionally courteous and hard working in their attempts to parallel park the bus up to the new kerbs.  The new kerbs cost a significant amount.  They are permanently in place now.  I was surprised to read that additional training is needed for them in terms of providing close-to-kerb pick-up opportunities for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that this is an issue that arose in committee, and so it must be something that is required.<\/p> <p> I also acknowledge the role that Dublin Bus plays in supporting people with special needs.  The public consultation dimension of BusConnects last year was very interesting.  One of the great problems that much of the public expressed with the BusConnects proposals, which had nothing to do with Dublin Bus, was the challenges it would pose for people with disabilities, special needs or mobility problems.  Instead of seamlessly taking one route to their place of work, leisure or training, those people might have to disembark, connect elsewhere and then connect again to get to their destinations.  More than any other group in our society, those with mobility challenges and those with disabilities would have been disadvantaged most by the proposals put forward.  Fianna F&aacute;il highlighted that in all of our submissions to the National Transportation Authority, NTA, and we hope that it has taken that on board.  If nothing else, and there was much more, the BusConnects public consultation phase highlighted quite accurately issues that would affect those with disabilities and would pose significant challenges for some people.  Indeed, those matters were highlighted quite quickly by those working in the area of disabilities.<\/p> <p> We often laugh at the real-time bus stop signage, but it is an advance, and it is providing more information for people of all abilities about the bus service.  Clearly, there are challenges and this report points them out.  We have not mentioned bus shelters, but they are a basic element of the bus service.  Everybody uses them.  Luas stations also have virtually no cover for anybody, whether fully able-bodied people or those with mobility challenges.  This report affords us an opportunity to look at this.<\/p> <p> The report contains recommendations on how to improve the bus services.  I am focusing on bus services, but I only have a short time in which to speak and perhaps it is useful to focus on just one or two things.  I have mentioned buses stopping immediately beside bus stops.  I hope that when we review this in the future this will be happening.  I believe it is not an issue for Dublin bus drivers, but it may be something they have to be reminded of.  One of the great outreach endeavours Dublin Bus engages in which parents have told me about concerns children or young adults with special needs.  If they are able to travel independently to their place of work or training, Dublin Bus has a well-used facility where an assigned employee goes to those individuals and coaches them through the procedure of taking a bus, including how to find the bus stop and finding the route.  They also accompany those individuals on the route until they become comfortable with it.  This is just one of the unheralded public services that Dublin Bus provides.<\/p> <p> Perhaps it goes without saying, but we should remind drivers to ensure that a passenger is fully seated and is in a safe place before a bus takes off.  Drivers should clearly state the route number and destination as passengers board, and also declare when the bus arrives at each stop if an automated announcement is unavailable.  These ideas are easy to implement and would cost nothing, but they could make a significant difference to the quality of people's experience of public transport.<\/p> <p> On rail, the report refers to the need for ramps, lifts and emergency call buttons to be provided and the need to ensure that they are functional at all stations.  Other Deputies have mentioned the dwindling number of staff at some stations.  I have heard about this through constituents and people I know.  In most cases it is not related to publicly funded public transport but rather taxis.  People come out of an event at night and simply cannot get a wheelchair-friendly taxi.  They can be standing around literally for hours, yet the State has invested quite a significant amount of money in grants for public service vehicles to ensure they are equipped for that purpose.<\/p> <p> I will not take up time for the sake of it. I have made the points I wanted to make.  I welcome the report, and will welcome the Minister of State's response in terms of how the Government intends to implement some of its key measures.  Some of these measures are very easy to implement, while others will require some degree of investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100051#CCC00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550773500,"counter":489,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, I thank all who spoke on the motion for their thoughtful and considered contributions on all of the issues raised.  I will bring their comments and concerns to the Minister and I hope that we can put some of the recommendations into action.  I thank the Chair of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy O'Dowd, all the committee members, and Senator John Dolan, who championed this issue.  I thank all of those who contributed to the report, in particular those with disabilities who have shared their experiences of using public transport.<\/p><p>I can say with certainty that we are all united in wanting a public transport system which has the needs of customers with a disability at its centre.  To achieve this requires a multifaceted approach and the active engagement of all the key stakeholders.  It involves not only the physical infrastructure, but also measures such as ticketing and information systems, travel assistance schemes, disability awareness training for staff, and contact and complaints handling systems.  Crucially, it requires the early and ongoing involvement of people with lived experience of disabilities and their representative organisations in the planning and design of public transport infrastructure and services.<\/p><p>The individual transport operators, both public and private, the NTA and local authorities, given their respective roles and responsibilities, must each play their part in delivering an accessible public transport system.  This requires co-ordination and a joined-up approach.  The NTA, with its functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network, has a key role to play.  The NTA&rsquo;s new position of transport accessibility manager, will act not only as an internal spokesperson in the NTA for customers with a disability but will also have responsibility for co-ordinating the accessibility programmes of transport operators, reviewing and auditing accessibility plans of transport operators, advising on the development of transport operator training programmes, and co-ordinating the access officers across all public transport operators.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Ross, in his opening speech set out some positive developments which have taken place and are taking place.  Many of these are being brought about as a result of the transport operators themselves identifying and acknowledging the need to improve the service they provide to passengers with disabilities.  Others arise from commitments and actions under a number of whole-of-government strategies and plans, in particular the national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  These commitments and actions are monitored at a national level by the NDIS steering group and the CES implementation group, respectively.  At a departmental level, the public transport actions for which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the NTA and-or transport operators have a lead role are monitored and reviewed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's accessibility consultative committee, ACC.  Membership of the ACC is drawn from organisations representing people with disabilities, members of the disability stakeholders group, key agencies under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as other relevant State agencies.  The ACC&rsquo;s work programme updates and minutes of meetings are available to view under the public transport section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport website, <i>www.dttas.ie\/public-transport\/engIish\/accessibility<\/i>.<\/p><p> One important aspect of the accessibility consultative committee is the opportunity to engage directly with transport operators and relevant agencies.  During the past year, several of the transport operators have made presentations to the ACC at which members have been able to raise policy and high-level issues of concern.  I understand that the feedback from these has been positive and that a key theme emerging is the importance of communications, both in terms of raising awareness of the good things that are happening and in letting people know when things are not working as they should.  This engagement at the ACC complements the work that goes on at the disability users groups that each public transport operator has in place.  The groups provide a forum for operators to consult and update disability organisations on accessibility proposals and developments, as well as for disability organisations to have operational and other accessibility issues addressed.  This is all positive and it should be welcomed.  However, the testimony to the joint committee hearing of those living with disabilities is a crucial reminder to all of us that we have some way to go before we meet our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as ratified by the Government in March of last year.  Article 9 of the convention provides that state parties \"shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas\".  Article 4.2 provides that \"With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, each State Party undertakes to take measures to the maximum of its available resources and, where needed, within the framework of international cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of these rights\".  We must therefore plan and strive for the progressive realisation of these rights.  These are challenges to achieve in the context of our legacy of public transport infrastructure, in particular our Victorian-era railway stations.<\/p> <p> The report of the joint committee acknowledged that the achievement of a publically accessible public transport system will require resources, including time and monetary investment.  Therefore, the committee recommended several measures to improve accessibility of public transport services in the short term.  Many of these measures do not require new or upgrading infrastructure.  Some concerns were raised about proper utilisation of accessibility features that already are in place.  Reference was made to practical steps that staff can take to make a journey more accessible for people with disabilities.  The committee report is a welcome addition to other Government strategies mentioned earlier that are aimed at improving the lives of people with disabilities.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has asked me to assure the House of his commitment to play his part as Minister with responsibility for the policies and overall funding of public transport to achieve this aim.<\/p> <p> I wish to thank everyone involved.  From reading the committee report it is obvious to me and to many others that those who use public transport services in particular have real concerns.  I agree with Deputy Lahart with regard to Dublin Bus.  The company has made vast improvement throughout the city not only in the buses but in how the staff approach people with disabilities.  I have had several experiences on some local buses.  Often it is down to the person who is driving the bus to facilitate people and to give them time.  This may require pulling up at the right time and giving people the opportunity to take their time to get on the bus.  Sometimes it is difficult.  I have witnessed this myself.  A friend of mine who has a disability is in a wheelchair.  We had to wait for three buses to pass before my friend could access a bus with a wheelchair.<\/p> <p> I thank the officials of the Department for their time and effort in putting this together.  I intend to bring back to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, the concerns raised this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100052#DDD00200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550774100,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank the staff of the committee, especially Mr. Paul Kelly and Ms Etaoine Howlett, who helped in the preparation of the report.  Without their help it would not have been the success that it clearly has been.  I will thank those who spoke in the order in which they spoke.  I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  I thank Deputies Troy, Pringle, Broughan, O'Loughlin, Munster, Br&iacute;d Smith, Brendan Ryan and Lahart.  We have had 11 speakers altogether in the debate.  This shows how important it is to Members from all parties and from the Independent ranks.  I wish to acknowledge the presence of the visitors in the Gallery.  They include witnesses who came before the committee and gave their time, effort and ideas.  I thank Mr. O'Leary in particular and his colleagues, as well as Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Delaney.  I left Ciar&aacute;n until last because he is probably the most important person who we meet in the House.  He is forever and always articulating, fighting for, supporting and trying to get change for people with disabilities.  He personifies the importance of advocacy.  That is what makes those of us who are politicians do things differently.<\/p><p>At the end of day we have 15 recommendations.  We will have the Minister before the committee at the end of April.  We will be asking for reports on each of the 15 individual recommendations.  Preferably before then - and if not then thereafter - we might identify or fix on four or five other new things that will happen or that we want to happen before the next six months unfold.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the comment of the Minister, Deputy Ross, to the effect that we all agree on the significance of the development at the National Transport Authority.  The authority has created the position of a transport accessibility manager.  That means that at the heart of all purchasing, routing and licensing of public transport there will be a transport accessibility manager.  The role will involve formal engagement.  It will not be hit-and-miss affair but a formal engagement with key disability representative groups.  The role will involve developing and monitoring an improvement plan for existing services and, as the Acting Chairman pointed out, issues relating to private service providers who may not necessarily have the facilities that public service providers are obliged to have and the question as to how one makes that happen.  The role will also involve assisting in the development of retrofit programmes and ensuring that accessibility is built into all new public transport infrastructure.  That is an absolute <i>sine qua non<\/i>.  In fact, it is the only way forward.<\/p><p>I learned one thing in particular from our committee hearings.  Some people came down to us from Belfast using the just-a-minute, JAM, card.  If someone with a disability presents at the point of contact with the service a card with the letters &quot;JAM&quot;, it is recognised in Northern Ireland.  I hope it soon will be recognised all throughout the Republic as well.  The idea is that the driver, who is professionally trained, will acknowledge and be aware instantly that the person has a disability and that adequate concern and time must be given to that individual.  I believe the initiative works efficiently and well.  That is a constructive and positive outcome from our deliberations.<\/p><p>It has been an honour to chair the committee.  The report could not have happened without the support of all our members.  I thank the Acting Chairman for chairing the debate.  I look forward to meeting the Minister in the near future to set about making the progress that is so badly needed and that everyone in the House, including ourselves and the witnesses in the Gallery, is fighting for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100053#EEE00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550774100,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550774100,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 26 February 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
