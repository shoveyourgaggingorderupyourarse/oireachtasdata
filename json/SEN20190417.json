I am thankful the Minister has come to the House today to address this issue.  I have been contacted by a number of early childcare providers for a variety of reasons over the past year, but I was alarmed to be told just last week that there is a system of withdrawing funding based on how promptly parents drop off or pick up their children at childcare facilities.  Is this the practice of Pobal, which administers this fund, that childcare providers are being unfairly penalised for parents leaving children late or collecting them early?  Are we really that inflexible?  Parents could be running late for an enormous number of reasons or they could get off work early and want to spend quality time with their child.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is being rather mean if money is being withheld from providers for these reasons.  The childcare staff still need to be paid, and the heat and light still need to be paid for.  Why would we have a system where providers have to take the hit for parents needing time in their lives to spend with their children?  Time is something that is becoming more and more precious for all of us.  Could the Minister clarify and explain the thinking behind this?<\/p> <p>This kind of thing does not happen to the capitation grants in our schools, so it should not happen in our preschools.  We have a massive issue with childcare in this country, and I hear about it on the doorsteps when I canvass in Carlow for the local elections.  We need a massive overhaul of how this is done.  In other countries preschools and schools fall under the same umbrella.  Until we classify things properly, we cannot do things right now to reap the benefits later.  I am eager to see what the new national childcare scheme will bring because parents and providers both need help, and staff need to be well paid.  Early childhood education and care should be affordable and high quality, but out of all the OECD countries, Ireland's childcare is the second most expensive for couples and the most expensive for single parents.  We only invest 0.2% of our GDP in childcare, which is miles behind the OECD average of 0.7%.  UNICEF recommended investing 1% to catch up.  We need to triple our investment in childcare.  Working parents spend around a fifth of their income on childcare, which is four times more than in Sweden, while childcare in Canada can cost as little as $10 a day.<\/p> <p>We have seen significant economic changes in Ireland over the last decade.  We have seen both a birth spurt and a birth decline.  We have seen opportunities expanded and possibilities opened for families.  We have seen a sea change in both women's and men's roles, and there is no such thing as normal anymore.  We are who we are and we live as we live, and we need to embrace that.  It is a major change and a whole new culture, but we are not keeping up with these changes.  It is said that politics lags behind reality by about 20 years, so it stands to reason that we are investing in what was needed in 1999, but it is now 2019 and significant investment and change are required.<\/p> <p>Providers in the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, say capitation of &euro;69, where staff have minimum qualifications of levels 5 and 6, over 38 weeks, does not come close to covering the costs and delivering the scheme.  The higher capitation rate of &euro;80.25 per child per week depends on a high standard of staff with paid experience.  The Minister is aware of the importance of this stage of education, and while the sector has seen an upsurge in parents being able to send their children to this stage, providers suffer because they are constantly making up the shortfall, or even going unpaid.  Several of them have told me they feel they are not making a wage.  These providers print and process all the paperwork for the scheme at a cost to themselves, and they do not get paid non-contract time when they are working on curricula, staff meetings, etc.  Insurance, commercial rates and other utilities have all increased dramatically, and more work needs to be done to invest in those who provide the high-quality childcare which we all seek.  It is wrong to make the provider pay when funding is being withdrawn due to the time keeping of parents.<\/p> <p>Carlow has one of the highest percentages of qualified early years staff in Ireland, yet many of them cannot afford to live on their wages.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When they qualify they often go into another field because they do not get enough pay and cannot get mortgages etc.  I know the Minister is aware of this and I believe she will be working on it.

It is getting harder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#A00500","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Assisting families to access high-quality, affordable early learning and care, and school-age childcare is a priority for me as Minister.  The Senator and her colleagues will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the past four budgets, now totalling &euro;575 million per year.  This funds a number of early learning and care, and school-age childcare programmes.  I want to see investment in this area continue to increase significantly over the coming years.  I am agreement with the Senator.<\/p> <p>I am delighted that First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to doubling investment over the next ten years.  Given the significant amount of public money invested in these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.  I believe that my Department&rsquo;s approach to protecting Exchequer funding and ensuring compliance with programme rules is balanced appropriately with supports we provide to services to enable them to continue to deliver a sustainable and high-quality service.<\/p> <p>Pobal, as administrator of my Department's funded childcare programmes, conducts compliance visits to childcare service providers.  These visits check a service&rsquo;s compliance with the published rules of Exchequer funded programmes.  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the 2018-19 programme year show a significant level of non-compliance, which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  In particular many childcare services have been found to be in breach of programme rules concerning attendance records and registrations.  Subsidies for the early learning and care, and school-age childcare programmes are based on actual attendance.  Attendance rules and their application do not penalise parents who occasionally pick up or drop off children early.  Pobal, when determining a pattern of attendance during a compliance visit, aims to apply the rules in a manner that maximises the amount payable to providers.<\/p> <p>Non-compliance with attendance rules represents a risk to Exchequer funds as it can lead to services receiving funding in excess of their entitlement.  For this reason, my Department, working with Pobal, identifies incorrect registrations and applies the relevant corrections to ensure that services are receiving the correct level of funding.  This is an important protection for the significant public funding invested into these programmes.  I fully recognise the challenges faced by services where incorrect registrations have been discovered.  That is why my Department has developed a strong case management system, operated by Pobal, through which a dedicated team assists services facing challenges.  This case management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance and is focusing on engaging those providers with an identified overclaim.  Community services can access a budget I have created to assist them to transition towards sustainability in a manageable way.  I am encouraged that the majority of services engage constructively with the compliance process and I would recommend services to contact Pobal or their local city or county childcare committee if they need support or advice.<\/p> <p>The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the national childcare scheme, as the Senator is aware.  The national childcare scheme was developed based on evidence of the best interests of children and families.  Its attendance rules will reflect the reality of children's and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses.  The national childcare scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care, and school-age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#B00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

If childcare providers are found to be non-compliant, Pobal and my Department work closely with them to support them in finding a way to move beyond that.

I know the Taoiseach has voiced his opinion and said he feels it should be kept.  I ask the Leader to use his good office to request the Minister of State with responsibility for defence to come to the House to discuss the possibility of looking at pay and conditions for all soldiers, but specifically for the air ambulance, and to make sure he can guarantee us that it is safe and will remain in Custume Barracks in Athlone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#H02700","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I would like to welcome a group from what used to be my own constituency of Bandon, TJ Hourihan and the YMCA group from Bandon, supported in the Gallery not alone by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony but also by Senator Lombard.

We have heard many interesting and helpful contributions from Members and any time somebody suggested to me that it was a filibuster I pointed out very clearly that it was not remotely a filibuster, that this is important legislation that needs to be discussed and carefully teased out.  I have yet to hear any Member of the Chamber defend the Bill in question, including anyone on the benches where the Leader sits.<\/p> <p>I may not have been here for as many hours as Senator McDowell but I would be up there for presence in the Chamber when it is being discussed and I have yet to hear one of the 60 Members of this Chamber say a good word about the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  It is not typical of the Leader to try to ram it through and it is not becoming.  It is slightly ironic that he is attempting to do it the day before the Taoiseach's annual address to this Chamber.  The Leader might reflect on the proposal because I do not want to be voting against the Order of Business all the time but on this occasion I will have to object to that particular part of it that requires a guillotine.  I am sorry to have to say that to the Leader because by and large I do not object to the Order of Business which is fair and reasonable.  I do listen to it which not every Member does when it is being read out.  They come back in at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. giving out about it.  I tell them the Order of Business was decided that morning and everyone voted for it and did not oppose it.<\/p> <p>It is important also to acknowledge this momentous day.  I welcome Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives.  I met Congressman Brendan Boyle, who is part of the delegation, last year in Washington.  I congratulate Billy Lawless on his ongoing engagement on all our behalf and his fantastic contribution on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to promoting Irish-American relations.  I wonder if there is anyone in this Chamber who does not have relatives in America.  My grandfather was the youngest of ten, one of whom died young and eight of whom went to America.  Many of us have family connections, if perhaps distant, in America.  There is a great bond there.

A lot of work is being done by the commission to promote the economic and social development of the western region.  It launched a five-year strategy entitled, Work Smarter, Live Better.  Much of the strategy centres on the promotion of enterprise hubs.  A sum of &euro;1 million is being provided from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support the further development of enterprise hubs, promote remote working, provide hot desk facilities and, overall, support people in returning to live in the region and enjoy the very good quality of life it offers.  I am aware of a number of enterprise hubs in the region which are not being utilised to maximum potential.  I specifically reference the enterprise hub in Ballinasloe where the Western Development Commission launch took place.  The first client entered into a lease agreement to occupy a space there, but there is much greater potential.

However, I am disappointed to learn that the heads of the Bill have yet to be published.  Such a long delay is unacceptable and many farm families are losing out as a result.  Many families who have loved ones in a nursing home for a long period will be facing severe financial hardship.  There is universal acceptance in both Houses of the need to modify the legislation.  A cap on assets for three years has been sought similar to that in place for residential homes.  The farming sector, in particular, is going through a very difficult time and the fact that this issue has not been resolved is adding to the pressure.

A decision was issued by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in August 2016 and it has taken until now to have an appeal dealt with.  Even though the appeal has been dismissed, the appellants have won because Apple has left.  The Athenry area has been deprived of an &euro;850 million development which potentially would have been followed by the development of further data centres.  This case clearly shows that there is a problem with the planning process and that it is not fit for purpose.  If we are serious about delivering and developing major investment and infrastructural projects, we need to do an awful lot better.  The decision is very poor consolation to the people of the Athenry area, the vast majority of whom were in favour of the development.  It also points to the fact that if another Apple was to arrive on the scene tomorrow, the same fate could await it.  Absolutely nothing has changed in the planning process which is not fit for purpose.  Perhaps even the way An Bord Plean&aacute;la handles these matters is not fit for purpose.  A review of the operation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la was ordered.  It was conducted and a series of recommendations were made, but we have heard nothing about their implementation.  I would like the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come before the House, as this is a very serious matter.  We have positioned Ireland as a small open economy to attract this type of tech industry, but we cannot facilitate it.  Apple is already up and running with a second data centre in Denmark, which speaks volumes.  <\/p> <p>In February the High Court delivered a judgment on European sites and lands designated as special areas of conservation.  While the decision might be helpful in clarifying what can be developed on designated land, it actually states An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot take mitigation measures into account.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If one can engineer one's way around an environmental problem, it is not good enough.

Once I saw scaffolding, I think I knew exactly what happened because it happened to me.  As we all know, these roofs, especially flat roof sections, have tar and pitch, particularly in old buildings.  I agree with Senator Humphreys on this.  One puts roofing felt on top of hot tar and goes along with the blow torch in front of it.  Anything under that is like tinder.  It has been there for years and can catch fire quickly.  The same thing happened to one of my restaurants about 15 years ago and but for a young little Mexican who went into a crawl space with a fire extinguisher, the place would be gone.  We have the same problem with old buildings in Ireland and we treat roofing and unregistered roofers very flippantly.  It should be totally regulated.  We have serious fire hazards, especially in older buildings.  I would like that to be brought to the relevant authorities, especially fire authorities.<\/p> <p>I was proud to see the Friends of Ireland, many of whom have become personal friends over the years and led by one of the greatest women leaders in the world, Nancy Pelosi, are coming here to celebrate our 100th anniversary.

Maybe some day.  I cannot support any notion that a guillotine would be introduced for this legislation.  The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is probably the most flawed legislation that I have ever seen come into either House in my eight years' experience in these Houses and in my many years of watching and studying how politics is conducted in these Chambers.  It is high time that the Minister, Deputy Ross, focused on his own brief.  Heaven knows there are far too many pressing issues in his own brief that he seems to be practically ignoring because of his unrelenting, ridiculous focus on this legislation.  Not only do the majority of Members of this House, in my opinion, disagree with it but many important international organisations have expressed their concerns with it.  It is quite likely that many, if not most, aspects of this legislation are deeply unconstitutional.  We have an obligation as elected Members-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#M00400","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#M00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>-----and appointees to this House to fully scrutinise this legislation, to do the business of the people in this House to ensure that the draft laws that we are considering are at the very least constitutional.

There is an ongoing local feud.  I have repeatedly raised that we have a very limited number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in our town where most towns of an equivalent size have ten to 12 garda&iacute; per unit per shift.  We have five to seven garda&iacute; in the area, trying to police an ongoing violent criminal feud without the resources they need.  Any time I raise this issue in this House, I am told by Ministers that it is not their responsibility and they do not allocate members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That did not stop the Minister for Justice and Equality from coming to my home town in December and promising members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they would get what they want and need.  Unfortunately, Drogheda did not get the garda&iacute; and resources that it needs.<\/p> <p>Deputy Ross is obsessed with the police station in his own home area but he has very little to say about ongoing criminal feuds in areas such as the north side of Dublin, referred to by my colleague, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, with the lack of policing resources there, or the lack of policing resources in my community.  I would prefer if he stuck to his own brief.  If he is expressing an interest in criminal justice, judicial and policing matters, he should do it in a holistic fashion and look at areas that need those resources, not his own area, because that is the worst type of parish pump politics.  It is the type of politics that he always said he never represented.  It is disgraceful that in this era of so-called new politics, when this Government decided that it was not going to use the guillotine, that it is using it now to fulfil its own agenda for its own narrow purposes.

It is only two weeks since I raised the issue of the Suhinthan family who decided to emigrate to New Zealand after being headhunted by employers there.  However, one of their three daughters was denied access to the country because she has Down's syndrome.  Obviously, this will force the family to abandon its plans.  I asked what this said about New Zealand, a supposedly tolerant country which is supposedly a friend to the Irish people.  Incredibly, a rather similar case has arisen, this time in Australia, and the details of which are, perhaps, even worse.  In 2009, Anthony and Christine Hyde moved from Dublin to Victoria, where he works as a bus driver and she is a teacher and assistant principal in a local primary school.  Their son, Darragh, was born there in 2015.  The family applied for permanent residency in Australia.  In the course of the application, their son was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.  The family met the criteria for permanent residency but, incredibly, the diagnosis led to their application being rejected due to the potential cost of the treatment of cystic fibrosis.<\/p> <p>Essentially, Australia and New Zealand are saying that skilled Irish people and their families are perfectly welcome so long as none of them is disabled.  If they are, they and their families are stigmatised and refused entry.  I hope we would never be so heartless here in Ireland.  Certainly, I am not aware of any situation where this has occurred or could occur here.  I cannot imagine a situation whereby a family from Australia or New Zealand would be turned away on the grounds that one of the children was born with a manageable medical or genetic condition.  If Donald Trump were to impose such a disgusting and discriminatory policy on immigrants to his country, there would be worldwide outrage, but when supposedly liberal and tolerant countries such as Australia and New Zealand do it, there is political silence and, effectively, a media blackout.  There has been an almost total media blackout here about these cases.  The initial application by the Hyde family was refused by the Australian immigration agency and is now under appeal to the administrative appeals tribunal.

It is very regrettable that, as a result of European procurement rules, the back office support for County Clare and its bus company is now moving to Limerick.  The hard-working people involved with Clare Bus are coming to Dublin at 2.30 p.m. today to hand in a petition to reverse the decision which has been signed by more than 6,000 people from County Clare.  I very much welcome them to Dublin.  I embrace their petition and sincerely hope that common sense can prevail.  I call on the NTA to reverse its decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#N01200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the 23 Senators who contributed on the Order of Business, including the 12 Members who spoke on the Judicial Appointments Bill.

They also provide that a plebiscite returning officer is responsible for giving public notice, the holding of the plebiscite, the distribution of information, the printing of ballot papers and making arrangements for postal and special voters.  The draft regulations set out who can attend the counting of votes, who can handle the ballot papers, and the arrangements for opening, extracting and counting the ballot papers.  On completion of the count, the draft regulations set out the procedures that must be followed by the plebiscite returning officer, including the retention and disposal of documents and the preparation for signature of the plebiscite certificate.  Electoral offences set out in the draft regulations apply many of the provisions regarding electoral offences contained in the Local Election Regulations 1995.  These include matters such as breach of secrecy, offences relating to ballot boxes, ballot papers and official marks, and obstruction of the poll and interference with electors.  These draft regulations provide for the procedural and administrative arrangements for the conduct of the plebiscites.  They simply mirror provisions that are already there for the conduct of other polls and Members will be familiar with those arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#AA02400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I know there are other speakers and that we only have a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#BB00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>It has to be concluded today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#BB00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

There are serious questions about the Government's campaign and whether it really wants to implement this.  It is not just about talk.

I am out canvassing with people who are standing for the local elections on 24 May along with the plebiscite and the referendum.  People do not even know that this is happening.  This lack of information and awareness will be the most significant issue.  People do not know what is happening on 24 May.  I am concerned about it.  I make sure to ask, when I go to doors, if people realise what is happening on 24 May.  They say that they do not.  I do not know what outcome will come from this because I feel that there was not enough information made available and awareness created by the Government.  I am concerned about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#BB00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I will be short and sweet.

I note that previous to this being approved, the Minister of State's party launched its campaign and I wish it well with its side of the argument.  In case there is any misunderstanding, I absolutely support the concept of a mayor but this is a bit of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangement.  To date, the councils have not spoken to say if the local authority will deliver on paying for it.  They cannot pay councillors.  They are still waiting for the Moorhead report on the &euro;16,500.  Many, including members of the Minister of State's party in Waterford and Limerick, have told me that they will oppose this.  I spoke to two or three members of Fine Gael in the D&aacute;il who say they are strongly opposed to it.  One is in Waterford.  Everyone has a right to take a different standard.  I am concerned about the capacity to pay the councillors for their job.  They are rightly angry and disappointed and they will use this as an opportunity to put pressure on the Minister of State and the Government to deliver on their pay and conditions.<\/p><p>A local property tax report has been sitting on the desk of the Minister for Finance for quite some time and it has been deferred again.  We need an honest and frank discussion about how we will fund local government and we have not had it.  It is being deferred for political reasons.  The Minister of State has not made a strong enough case yet about how he will fund local government and pay elected members.  There is some suggestion of what he might pay these mayors.  He and Fine Gael opposed empowering councillors and waiving a fee of &euro;20 for planning applications, so much so that he could not even produce tellers for a division here and we won it hands down.  I was personally overwhelmed by the support from councillors in Fine Gael and others who said that they could not rely on their own people to support councillors.  Not only did we pass it, we had to put pressure in a number of quarters to have that legislation signed through.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has no strong argument or policy for how he will fund local government.  That is the reality.  He has sat on a report about local property tax and done nothing about it.  The Minister of State has not, as of today, delivered on the long-promised Moorhead report to give councillors fair pay and fair remuneration.  His party took a stand to launch a campaign in advance of this motion being approved in this House.  The Minister of State should do what he has to do.  He and Senator Buttimer have jobs to do.

I support the opportunity for a plebiscite for the electors of Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council, where the people will decide the outcome of the plebiscite, not Senators or Deputies.  It is democratic for them to get that opportunity.  The Minister of State is aware of concerns.  Minds and votes are to be won by properly informing about and clarifying this debate.  In principle, I support the role of a directly elected mayor but I am concerned with the current detailed proposals from Government.  Many pros and cons need to be carefully considered.  That needs to be debated.  There is a concern that there could have been more time and consultation with local authority members, the chief executive officers of councils and with staff who will be directly impacted.  In the end, I know that the Minister of State wants to improve the delivery of local government and services, which is important.  We need to clarify the relationship between the directly elected mayor and the chief executive officer, and the elected council.  There are long-established functions reserved for the executive and with the new role of a directly elected mayor, there will be some confusion.  There already is and that needs to be clarified.<\/p> <p>The Government's detailed proposals state that where a directly elected mayor can present a strong performance, he or she could potentially strengthen the case for further devolution of powers.  Is that up or down?  Is it devolution from central government down to the directly elected mayor or is it up from the elected council?  We need to clarify that and the Minister of State might address that in debates over the period before the election.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also a further quote that the mayor can make a case to Government to devolve more powers to him or her.

This just a critical analysis I am giving to the Minister of State about issues that need to be clarified if this plebiscite is to be won, as the Government wants to happen.<\/p><p>The detailed policies state that the elected council should be able to direct the mayor to refrain from doing a particular act.  Under section 140 of the Local Government Act, a particular act should remain with elected council.  That is not definite enough.  It should be either \"should\" or \"would\".

We do not need the measures contained in the Bill.  The Government is getting on perfectly well without them.  What is the compulsion to spend millions of euro to do what the Government is perfectly capable of doing without those measures?  I strongly believe that should be underlined.  There is nothing stopping this or any subsequent Government appointing high-quality judges such as those the Government has been appointing in recent times using the means it has adopted and taking advice from wherever it wishes.  It does not need to set up a quango which will cost a large sum of money and delay the whole process immensely.  The interesting thing is that the process detailed in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>does not seem to entail a public advertisement of the positions of President of the Circuit Court and President of the District Court, but this Bill will entail such advertisement, which is extraordinary.  I do not know why we should have a public advertisement and the involvement of a commission.  I know that the Minister does not want the commission to be involved in certain high-level appointments.<\/p><p>I come back to another point I made on the Bill.

I will take my leave when instructed to so do by the Chair or Senators.<\/p><p>In the meantime, on amendment No. 95a, I made clear that I intend to address the mechanism set out in the Bill for senior appointments by tabling the necessary amendments on Report Stage.  I will need the assent or affirmation of Government in that regard.  I will recommend such amendments because I am firmly of the view that section 44 needs to change.  I expect that, at least, it will revert to how it was in the Bill as initiated.  In 2017, the Government decided to use a new arrangement along the lines set out in the original section 46 - the mechanism referred to by Senator McDowell - of a three-person committee to advise on the appointment of the Chief Justice.  It worked well.  In fact, I wish to acknowledge on the record of the Seanad that it worked so well that last year the Government decided to use a similar non-statutory three-person advisory committee in respect of the appointment by Government of the President of the Court of Appeal.  Senators have accepted that it worked well.  The three-person committee comprised the Chief Justice, the chair of the top-level appointments committee and the Attorney General.  Against the background and in light of the remarks of Senator McDowell on what he read in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a similar-type construct is proposed for the impending appointment of the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court.  Of course, I proposed it because this legislation and the new commission are unlikely to be in place by June or July of this year.  I accept that as a reality.  Even if the legislation was passed tomorrow-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#DD01900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>It would take a year to implement it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#DD02000","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>-----it would take some time to implement it.

I will introduce the special advisory committee arrangement to section 44 on Report Stage when I will seek the support of Senators for it.

As I understand it, the process does not involve putting an advertisement in a newspaper to say it is proposed to fill a vacancy and invite people to apply for it, but perhaps I am wrong about that.  Perhaps the committee is going to put advertisements in the newspapers, but I do not think it is.  I think it will just look at the available members in those courts or whatever else and come up with a process that will not involve putting advertisements in the newspapers and carrying out interviews.  It will come up with its own informal report within a matter of weeks.  That is precisely the way the system should work.<\/p><p>I am warning the Minister that if every ordinary position in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court has to be the subject of an advertisement, interviews and the like and if sitting members of the Judiciary have to apply, as well as non-sitting members, it will not be possible to follow the perfectly reasonable approach taken to the presidencies of the Circuit Court and the District Court in the new arrangements for these positions for ordinary members of the courts.  I go back to the point which has been the subject of an attempt to amend the Bill, that there are consequential vacancies.  If the Government decides to move somebody from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, that will create a vacancy.  If that decision is made and it then has to start advertising the vacancy in the Court of Appeal and seeking applications, every consequential appointment process will be very lengthy.  If it is a triple or double linked chain where at the end the Government decides to fill the position in the Court of Appeal with someone from the High Court, one appointment to the Supreme Court may trigger a cascading series of obligations to start a new competition every time and receive new short lists from the commission.  That is incredibly clumsy, but it would all be avoided if the Minister at least was to accept that when the people in 1994 created the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, they said they would not apply it to &quot;promotional appointments&quot; in the Judiciary because they did not have to have competitions to do so and that there was no need to do it.  The system works perfectly well, as the Government is showing week after week in the appointments it is making.  This is all just an expensive waste of time.  It is not just a waste of time and a quango, it is also going to disimprove the quality of the Judiciary because it will deter people from making themselves available for promotion.<\/p><p>The interesting characteristic of what I read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today - I believe the report is correct - is that the new body will be charged with the task of seeking out people for promotion, tapping people on the shoulder to ask them if they are willing to become President of the court.  It is a different approach.  That is perfectly reasonable and I have no objection to the Government's having an advisory body that will tap people on the shoulder to tell them that they have made enough money from their practice as a solicitor or a barrister and suggest they do the State some service, instead of having this utterly different approach where there cannot be any canvassing, communication or signalling in advance to a talented person that he or she should apply.  None of that will be permissible under the new system.  It will be quite the reverse; the person will be told that if he or she applies, he or she is not supposed to talk about it to anybody who is involved in the process and that he or she is to simply apply on the blind, so to speak.  That will make for a really serious disimprovement in the Judiciary, in the usual way of getting high quality people to accept that they should do the people some service in the form of judges. The philosophy of the Bill is deeply misconceived in one respect.  From my knowledge of practitioners, solicitors and barristers, there are several of them who have had it as a lifelong ambition to become a judge, but there is a much larger number who understand the life of a judge is an onerous one, that it is socially isolating, that it is less remunerative for many partners in large solicitors&rsquo; firms and many senior counsel than their current mode of living.  For them, the notion that underlies the philosophy of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is that this is all gravy, that it is a gravy train, that it is jobs for the boys-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#EE00800","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>He would know all about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#EE00900","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>-----that it is about handing out sweets to one's favourites-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#EE01000","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>He would know all about that too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#EE01100","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>-----that it is about giving things to people who may not deserve them-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#EE01200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>He would know all about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#EE01300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>-----and that it is about handing out the baubles of political power to people.

The amendment proposes to insert a subsection (2), &quot;Where a notice of appointment to judicial office is published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;l <\/i>in accordance with this section a person who was recommended in the past three years by the Commission for appointment to a judicial office of the same type shall be a person recommended by the Commission for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>.&quot;  That means that if somebody is short-listed in the relatively recent past for a position of a particular kind the Government, in publishing a notice in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il, <\/i>could state that the person had been recommended by the commission for that position.  The reasoning behind the amendment is that every time a notice in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il <\/i>is published which does not state that a person has been recommended by the commission, people may draw an inference that the person was never recommended by the commission, has not gone through the process or been short-listed and has never been considered by the Government before.  That would be unfair to some people because it would suggest the Government had ignored the commission when, in fact, the Government would be remembering that a person had been previously recommended and that their name had been on a shortlist of three persons recommended by the commission for that type of judicial office.<\/p><p>It is arguable that the existing text of section 48(1)(<i>a<\/i>) allows a Government to state that a person whose name did not appear on the most recent shortlist was a person who had been recommended by the commission to the Minister in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and that this amendment is not strictly necessary but I have the feeling that the Minister does not intend that a person who was previously recommended, and not on the latest shortlist, would qualify as a person who had been recommended by the commission to the Minister.  Therefore, what I am attempting to achieve with this amendment is to keep recommendations alive for a period of three years.  In the context of a previous discussion on section 47, the Minister indicated that he might consider a time-limited period in which a recommendation would remain alive, even if a person was not on the latest list.  This amendment puts that to the Minister.  What is wrong with my amendment?  What is wrong with accepting it?  It seems to be an improvement to the Bill and it should be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#HH00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I am sure the House will join with me in welcoming a delegation from the European affairs committee of the national assembly of Portugal, led by Ms Regina Bastos, chairperson of the committee.

Are they sworn to secrecy?  Is that the idea?  If I, for instance, as a barrister, had applied to the commission and I was not short-listed, the Minister says that in accordance with best practice I will be told that.  Can I tell my friends that I did not make the shortlist?  Likewise, if I am short-listed, am I somehow sworn to secrecy?  Is it to be the case that I cannot tell people that I am now on the shortlist that will go to Cabinet?  I want to have clarity as to whether the fact that one is being short-listed is to be a complete secret or if one is entitled to know about it but is sworn to secrecy about it in some duty of confidentiality, or if one is perfectly free to go on television and announce that one was short-listed three times for appointment to the High Court or whatever it is and say that one is astonished that one has not been appointed after all these years.

The Attorney General could say to the President of the High Court or somebody that his or her court needs strengthening and ask him or her to come up with some names of people who they should try to get to accept appointment to the court because they do not seem to be applying in sufficient numbers.  There is nothing wrong with approaching people and telling them they should consider serving their country as a judge and that they should consider that they have had a very good opportunity to earn a good living as a lawyer and now they might consider doing some public service.  Of course, somebody who is at the receiving end of such an approach, from my experience, would consider that such an approach would not be made if he or she was then just thanked for volunteering and told there is no interest in his or her application.  That process is totally unreal.  If a feeler is put out to people and they are asked to consider being a judge, by whatever channel, be it the Attorney General, the Minister or a senior judge, and if people are given the signal that the Government would like to appoint them or thinks they should apply for appointment, it seems to me to be completely ridiculous that they should then put in their application and find that they were misunderstanding the message completely and there really was very little interest in appointing them in the first place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->From my experience as Attorney General and Minister for Justice and Equality, there were occasions when people were asked to make themselves available as judges, both through and not through the JAAB.

I thank the House for accommodating this legislation this afternoon.  Before I speak to the amendments I wish to outline my position and that of the Government on this Bill.  I want to express my strong view to Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that I am supportive of the amendments proposed to the Bill on Committee Stage, subject to legal advice and the need for further amendments in specific incidences, to which I will refer.<\/p> <p>The general principle of the Bill, to consolidate and codify the law on perjury, is commendable.  I am aware that historically it has proven difficult to have a successful prosecution for perjury and subornation of perjury at common law.  I accept what Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has said that the essence of the Bill is the real need to provide for a more effective and streamlined process through which this offence can be prosecuted.  This will allow us to move towards realising this objective by placing the offence and other related offences on a statutory footing.  This is what the Bill purports to do, and I agree with it.<\/p> <p>I recognise the work that has gone in to the Bill by Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh in producing and publishing the Bill and for initiating debate on it in the Seanad.  It is a very welcome development on the basis of the far-reaching issues we are seeking to address here.  I also acknowledge the input of Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's colleagues, Senators Marshall, Boyhan and McDowell, for having it presented to the House and developing the Bill in the context of discussions with other interested parties and stakeholders.<\/p> <p>The offence of perjury has been the subject matter of much media comment recently, especially with regard to the business community.  Some business organisations have called for new legislation to be put in place to make it somewhat easier to prosecute the offence particularly in the matter of personal injury claims, which impact directly on the unacceptably high level of insurance costs.  The House will be aware that my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance reform, Deputy D'Arcy, intends to introduce legislation to ensure greater protection and fairness for policyholders.  I acknowledge the importance of the Bill in this because it will complement that legislation by providing a deterrent effect to those people across our society and in communities who wish to continue to abuse the law through the making of fraudulent claims.  This is really important and I congratulate Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on this.<\/p> <p>On the future, including these amendments and having reiterated the fact that I support the general principle of the Bill, I assure Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that I will continue to engage with him to further develop and strengthen the Bill so that I may be in a position to continue to support the Bill as it progresses through the Houses.  I have received many of the substantive amendments to the Bill over the last ten days.  My officials have sought the legal advice of the Attorney General on these issues. There could be a number of matters on which I may need to bring forward amendments at a later Stage, which focus generally on issues such as whether there is a need to equate penalties in this Bill with those provided in other legislation across the criminal justice system and whether the new offence of fabricating evidence might raise other concerns - and I would be keen to hear from Senators on this.  Another matter may be the potential risk of double jeopardy arising in relation to any overlap in other legislation already enacted.  In section 1, for example, the definition of judicial or other proceedings needs to be further developed and expanded.  I will refer to these issues as the House deals with the relevant sections in the Bill.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment that provides for the inclusion of a definition of perjury in section 1.  This definition mirrors the definition already provided for in section 2.  I agree with that.  Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach will clarify if it would be in order, for ease of reference and for ease of debate, if I may speak to section 1 at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#PP01100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>We are on section 1, amendment No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#PP01200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach might invite comments from Senators-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#PP01300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#PP01400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I am considering bringing forward an amendment to section 1 regarding the definition of judicial or other proceedings.  One possible problem I see with the Bill is that it appears to define a proceeding as primarily involving the administration of justice and then states that this includes tribunals.  A question might arise if this formula includes tribunals of inquiry, as well as decision-making tribunals.  Senators will be aware that a tribunal of inquiry does not administer justice.  It is concerned exclusively with the discovery of facts.  Such a tribunal is a fact-finding exercise.  We may consider whether commissions of investigation should be provided for under this definition.  This is a policy matter.  I would be happy to engage with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on this precise issue.  I am also keen to ensure that we might be in a position to advance the Bill alongside other measures that both Houses are considering, across a number of Departments, to see if we can deal with the very challenging, important and urgent issue of insurance costs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am conscious of time here and of the fact that we have to go to the D&aacute;il and perhaps that we might give consideration to the D&aacute;il taking this Bill in Government time.

I know two of the team in the Department who are with the Minister here.  We have engaged quite extensively on the Bill and its drafting and taking into consideration the various inputs from a vast array of stakeholders in making the Bill as robust as possible.  That was the underlying basis and purpose on which the departmental officials engaged in the conversations and meetings I had with them.<\/p> <p>Like me, the Minister has a legal background and would de facto have an involvement in relation to court cases, evidence and the robustness of evidence.  This Bill is intended to help create that robustness in evidence that is of great importance.  I do not believe there was one prosecution for perjury in 2017 of the thousands of cases in the District, Circuit and High Court and in the other courts of the land.<\/p> <p>I thank the parliamentary legislative drafter for drafting the Bill.  It will be noted that there are almost 100 other pieces of legislation referred to.  That is used in the research and due diligence in preparing this very robust Bill.  I thank my colleagues for their support, which is very valuable and is very much appreciated.  We are very much on the one team on this.  I also thank my parliamentary assistant, Cait Nic Amhlaoibh, a key person in all of this.<\/p> <p>I understand that the Minister and the Government will provide Government time for Report Stage of Bill, which it is hoped will be in May or June, so that we can move it on to the D&aacute;il and to the next stage.  I note what the Minister said about insurance, business and other areas.  That is crucially important.  I note also what the Minister said about tribunals of inquiry and their role.  I look forward to working with the Minister and his officials in making this Bill even more robust.  I welcome his support for this Bill at this stage, given that he may come back on Report Stage with further suggestions for amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#QQ00700","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I commend Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on his initiative in bringing about this legislation and I very much welcome the supportive and co-operative approach of the Minister and his Department to the Senator's initiative.  In the current climate, everyone is talking about personal injuries, fraud and all of that.  Perjury is a wider issue than that.  People can tell appalling lies in commercial and matrimonial cases and many other areas and do great damage to others, either personally or financially, or they may amass substantial gains for themselves by their behaviour.  For instance, with whistleblower legislation, affidavits of discovery are very important in the judicial process.  It keeps parties honest.  I do not want to say anything overly dramatic but it is important that there are sanctions for telling lies on oath, not merely in court, but also in an affidavit that is going to influence the outcome of a court case.  If a person has destroyed or falsified a document or affidavit of discovery, this can be of great importance.<\/p> <p>The Minister has said that he has in excess of 100 pieces of legislation sitting on his desk.  He has very graciously said that he does not want to reopen other things that have happened in this House today.  Nobody is holding him up on this Bill or any of those other Bills.  I emphasise that when it came to the Judicial Council Bill, this House was very facilitative in getting it through Committee Stage and on to Report Stage.  That Bill is sorely needed, and I struggled for a number of years when I occupied the chair the Minister does now to get the Bill off the runway, so to speak, and airborne but with little success, due to factors that I will not go into now.  We need a judicial council and this House is not, as it has been portrayed by some, holding up the Minister's programme.  This House may have a view on one Bill, but nobody is stopping him from progressing everything else.<\/p> <p>In a genuinely warm way I am delighted that the Minister is prepared to consider making Government time in this House available for Report Stage and that he has such a positive approach to the amendments which Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has drafted to make this Bill as good as it possibly can be, so that when it is passed by this House, and I hope that is soon, it can go to the other House as a Bill which the Government can adopt completely in that House and pass into law as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>There are many who are prepared to perjure themselves in court.  As long as the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the view that a statutory basis for perjury prosecutions must be put in place, the old thing that the Minister and I probably have heard on many occasions in court, where it is said that a file is going to have to be sent to Director of Public Prosecutions, will remain a very idle threat for people who have committed perjury because of the difficulties in proving the case and in stating exactly what perjury means.<\/p> <p>The oaths Act needs to be looked at too.  At the moment, if someone opts to affirm rather than swear, the judge is obliged - some judges forget about this - to put statutory questions to the witness and to ask him or her whether his or her unwillingness to swear is based on the absence of religious belief or the presence of religious belief which prohibits that witness from swearing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is an embarrassing process for witnesses to have to go into their religious beliefs in court when it is not necessary.  If evidence on affirmation is treated in exactly the same way as proposed in this legislation, which is to say in the same way as evidence on oath, it is not really necessary to grill people about their views on religious matters and to put them through that mill.  I will leave it at that.

Some argue against the corroboration requirement because we do not generally in law subscribe to a quantitative theory of evidence, where the evidence or testimony of one witness is deemed insufficient simply on the basis of there not being more than one witness.  We also have an independent public prosecution office, which is the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That office is legally mandated to exercise objectivity in all its work and dealings and independence in the matter of its decision making capacity.  It needs to be at all times objective and independent in pursuit of prosecutions.<\/p> <p>Historically, as Senators will be aware, the requirement of corroboration was developed across the water in Britain in the context of the era when private prosecutions were the norm and where, as a result of this, corroboration was seen as a protection against such private prosecution cases which often times lacked objectivity and which sometimes lacked integrity, but that context does not really apply here.  However, I am off the view and agree that the corroboration requirement should be retained for a number of reasons.  First, retention of this provision reflects the position in common law in that a person cannot be convicted of perjury solely on the testimony of one witness.  Second, and to put it rather simply, I consider that one person's testimony against another is not a sufficient basis on which to legislate for the prosecution of perjury.  Third, the statutory corroboration requirement has been in place in England and Wales for over 100 years now and I do not detect that it has been the subject matter of real and serious difficulty in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  It is reasonable and fair to consider that corroboration enhances the safety, integrity and soundness of convictions in the absence of any corroboration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#SS02400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 8.

The research and background work done on the section are related to it.  We have also had numerous discussions with officials in the Department.  The Minister may wish to reflect on this before Report Stage.  I wanted to share with Members and the Minister, in particular, where the thinking behind the section came from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#TT00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I accept what the Senator said.  The penalty proposed on summary conviction is a class B fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or on indictment a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or both.  This is in line, as the Senator said, with the penalties in Northern Ireland.  It has been designed to ensure all-island synergy in the offence imposed.  However, it is not unusual for there to be differences in neighbouring jurisdictions in the penalties imposed for similar offences.  There is always a possibility, for example, that there might be an increase in the maximum penalties for perjury in Northern Ireland, in which case the question would arise as to whether we should follow suit immediately.  However, greater problems might arise in this jurisdiction if we had different maximum sentences for substantially similar conduct under two statutes.  I will examine the position further on penalties imposed for similar offences under other legislation on the Statute Book here, particularly the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, of which sections 14 and 25 which deal with perjury and false declarations in making personal injury claims provide for a penalty not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.  Notwithstanding the fact that we acknowledge the discretion on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions in deciding whether to bring a prosecution and the nature of the charge, I am not sure whether it would be desirable to provide for significantly contrasting maximum penalties for a similar offence.  I will consider the matter further and might come back with a further amendment.<\/p> <p>We have dealt with amendment No. 20 to the section.  I do not propose to say anything further about it, but it is important, given the possible misuse of power to prosecute an offence under the section by aggrieved parties in civil or other proceedings.  It is important that the right to commence proceedings for offences of perjury be given exclusively to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This will have the effect and consequence of ensuring there will be less of a risk of vexatious, groundless or unsubstantiated proceedings being brought under the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#TT00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Section 12 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>SECTION 13<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p><blockquote>In page 12, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) The Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2018, this subsection and, in so far as they relate to the amendment to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893, <i>section 15(2) <\/i>and <i>Schedule 2 <\/i>may be cited together as the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2019 and shall be read together as one.<br \/><br \/>(3) The Friendly Societies Acts 1896 to 2018, this subsection and, in so far as they relate to the amendment to the Friendly Societies Act 1896, <i>section 15(2) <\/i>and <i>Schedule 2 <\/i>may be cited together as the Friendly Societies Acts 1896 to 2019 and shall be read together as one.<br \/><br \/>(4) The Insurance Acts 1909 to 2018, this subsection and, in so far as they relate to the amendment to the Assurance Companies Act 1909, <i>section 15(2) <\/i>and <i>Schedule 2 <\/i>may be cited together as the Insurance Acts 1909 to 2019 and shall be read together as one.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019041700002#TT01000","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Section 13, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Schedule 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1555493400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>SCHEDULE 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1555493400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px;
