I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  It is a pity that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, could not be here.  Naas community college is operated by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB.  It has received planning permission on a site that has been selected for some years.  My understanding of the current situation is that the tenders have been accepted and examined and it is hopeful that the builders will be on site in November.<\/p> <p>The problem is the current situation with the school.  The first class that started in the school has reach transition year, TY.  It is more than likely that those TY students will not have an opportunity to ever enter the new school.  The school is spread over three locations.  One is Craddockstown, in temporary structures adjacent to a primary school, while the TY year is housed in what I would term condemned buildings, prefabs, at Pipers' Hill.  I understand the Department has spent &euro;60,000 refurbishing those buildings.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Defence will certainly understand the importance of physical education, PE, in the life of a student and the reason for the third location used by the school.  The local GAA club in Naas has very kindly provided facilities for the school.  The three locations are not adjacent to each other; they are located at opposite ends of Naas.<\/p> <p>There are 320 applicants for first year in Naas community college this year but the school will have space to accommodate just 120 pupils.  There are no classrooms available for those pupils coming into the school in September.  The cost to the school, which it raises from its own budget, is &euro;24,000 for shuttle buses to move the students around to the various locations.  That does not take into consideration the difficulties teachers also have in moving around those locations.  I look forward to the response and update from the Minister of State.  The builders will be on site sometime in November, but I am concerned with the current situation.  The pupils in TY now will never have access to the new building.  What are we going to do over the next year and a half of the building programme?  There are no classrooms for the children coming into the school next September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#A00500","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and providing me with the opportunity to update the House on the delivery of a new building for Naas community college.  The school opened in September 2015 in temporary accommodation at Craddockstown Road, Naas.  In the meantime, a project for a new building for the school, fit to house 1,000 pupils, was devolved for delivery to KWETB by the Department of Education and Skills through a service level agreement.  I am pleased to inform this House that the architectural planning process for the delivery of this project is nearing completion.  The design team completed the contractor pre-qualification process for the project in December 2018.  Tender documents issued in May and tenders were returned in June.  There was a robust tender competition, with all eight of the short-listed contractors bidding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The outcome of that process is that a preferred contractor to complete the project has been identified.  A letter of intent was issued last month in that regard.  A number of steps need to be taken before a letter of acceptance can be issued to the preferred contractor.  The design team is carrying out these steps, which will allow for the confirmation of the appointment of that contractor.  These steps are expected to be completed very shortly, and the project is still on target to begin construction on site next month.  It is expected, on this basis, that the school will be ready for occupation before September 2021.<\/p><p>While enrolment for the 2018-2019 school year was 379, this figure is up from 266 in 2017-2018 and 163 in the previous year.  Increases in intake in the coming years are expected along similar lines.  In that context, KWETB, supported by the Department of Education and Skills, is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the temporary accommodation arrangements being put in place for the school will be sufficient to meet its needs until the new school building is ready.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills recently met school representatives of KWETB in respect of that matter.  Approval was given at that meeting for KWETB to proceed with a revised brief for the provision of this temporary accommodation.  That is being progressed as a matter of priority.<\/p><p>It is most regrettable that this project has not yet been delivered as a result of a number of delays.  For example, as the project is being delivered on a site in an area which is earmarked for wider development, it encountered significant delays during the planning permission process.  Planning permission for the project was ultimately granted in April 2017.  Following the granting of planning permission, changes to the stage 2b submission were necessary to include a number of changes to areas from planning conditions and the public works contracts to alterations to the Department of Education and Skills room layouts.  An understanding of the impact of these changes was a requirement for the design team to carry out a significant level of work to redo drawings, layouts and schedules.  The quantity surveyor also had to revisit all the measurements and quantities relating to the bill of quantities.  There were other delays caused by issues with ESB International regarding the relocation of overhead power lines traversing the site, and a consequential delay in ensuring compliance with the requirements of the nearly zero energy building regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#A00600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I again thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  Perhaps he will pass on a couple of queries to the Minister.  I welcome everything the Minister of State said.  As stated earlier, I expect the school to be open before September 2021.  I have identified the fact that the school is operating across three sites at present.  That is key.  PE classes will be very difficult because the site in Craddockstown is not large enough to cater for the PE needs of the school.  I again thank Naas GAA for allowing its facilities to be used by the school.  As for the possibility of all other subjects and classes being held on the one site, will the Department of Education and Skills approve sufficient funding to allow KWETB to procure or rent whatever classroom facilities it needs?  My understanding at present - and it makes me nervous to say it - is that the Department of Education and Skills has decided not to grant KWETB the full number of classrooms required to take in the minimum number of 120 pupils for the year ahead and that we will still, next year and possibly the year after, have the problem that the school will be located across three sites.  Can the Minister of State give me some detail as to how this procurement will be progressed and whether it will be in place in time for the start of the school year?

He will know that I had requested the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to do so, but I appreciate the Minister of State's presence.  I hope the Minister has communicated with him on the issue of Spinraza.  The Minister of State will know that we have been fighting for Spinraza to be made available for the past two years.  We were absolutely thrilled when Spinraza was approved on 11 June.  We accepted that four to six weeks, or however long necessary, would be required to do the paperwork in order to have the drug administered.  Then, on 23 August, there was a sign-off on it.  At that point, the parents of the children who need Spinraza were told that everything would be put in place and that they could expect the drug to be administered at the end of October.<\/p> <p>The end of October is approaching and the parents have been given another update stating that, due to resource issues, together with bed shortages, the drug that has been approved and that is necessary cannot be administered.  I look at these children, and their parents look at them, and they tell me that this is almost worse than the drug not being approved.  This pertains to Mayo in particular because we have Grace O'Malley and her friends and Cillian Mearns, who have done work on this.  We need to know when the drug will be administered.  It was cruel in the first place for them to have to wait for so long for Spinraza to be approved, but there is an additional cruelty in knowing that it has been approved and is there.  The drug has been purchased, and now the HSE tells us it does not have the resources to have it administered.  We are not talking about a staffed bed for a long period.  The Minister of State will know that Spinraza can be administered to day patients, so all we need is a bed for the day, or even half the day, to get the drug administered.  That, we are told, is not available.  Over the first two months the drug is administered four times and then the dosage decreases.  We are talking about just 11 patients who are ready and suitable for this treatment.  I hope the Minister of State can give me very specific answers today as to when these children, including Grace and Cillian, will get a specific date to start on Spinraza.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#B00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue and for giving me, on behalf of the Minister for Health, the opportunity to clarify the position on the availability of Spinraza for patients with spinal muscular atrophy.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  The Minister for Health has no role in this statutory process.<\/p><p>On 11 June 2019, the HSE leadership team approved access to the drug Spinraza for children with spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, type I, II or III on an exceptional and individualised basis.  The HSE decision process for Spinraza involved a full health technology assessment followed by detailed consideration by the HSE expert groups on new drug therapies, including the technology review group for rare diseases and the HSE drugs group.  Evidence of the clinical effectiveness of this new drug therapy was also reviewed.  After a thorough review, it was decided to approve access for children with genetically confirmed SMA type I, II or III in accordance with the controlled access criteria recommended by the rare diseases technology review committee.  The actual patient assessment and approval process is the means for determining access, on an individual case-by-case basis, to this complex treatment.  The HSE has indicated that 11 children have been approved for Spinraza treatment in Temple Street Hospital since July.  Application for approval is based on clearly defined criteria and clinical guidelines being followed in each case.  All patients who have been recommended clinically have been approved to date.<\/p><p>All of the patients who have been approved for Spinraza treatment are being treated under special care, according to Children's Health Ireland, at Temple Street Hospital.  Detailed clinical guidelines have been developed for this service, which includes specific patient criteria that must be fulfilled in order for the treatment to safely commence and continue.  The actual delivery of this drug to approved patients in a safe and sustainable way requires specific and complex service arrangements to be put in place in Temple Street Hospital.  Spinraza is injected during a procedure known as lumbar puncture.  There are two categories of patient for the administration of Spinraza.  Category 1 is where the administration of Spinraza is deemed not too technically difficult.  In that case, the consultant paediatric neurologist and lead clinician need access to the day ward as administration is performed under local anaesthetic.  Each of these patients will also require a physiotherapy assessment prior to administration and recovery time in the day ward.  Category 2 cases are more complex patients who have already undergone spinal fusion surgery and insertion of spinal rods, which makes the administering of Spinraza potentially more complex.  For these patients, the delivery of Spinraza will require specialist care to include input by an anaesthetist and an interventional radiologist with associated nursing, and the availability of capacity in the paediatric intensive care unit.<\/p><p>The Senator will appreciate, therefore, that a considerable amount of service planning and assessment of patients at an individual level is required for treatment with Spinraza to be safely undertaken.  The Minister for Health has been advised by the HSE that Children's Health Ireland is engaging on an individual basis with the families involved regarding each child's treatment plan.  He has asked to be updated further as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#B00600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I do not take heart from the statement as it outlined what I already know.

The introduction of a nationwide ban on bituminous or smoky coal was promised by the Government back in 2017, but it is being held up due to threats of legal action by suppliers.  Since the introduction of the smoky coal ban in Dublin in 1990 by Mary Harney, it is estimated that a staggering 8,200 deaths have been prevented in the capital.  A number of councils around the country are taking independent action on air pollution to protect their communities and are tabling motions to ban smoky coal in their areas.  Sarah O'Connor, CEO of the Asthma Society of Ireland, stated last month:<\/p><blockquote>Air pollution is a public health concern, with potentially harmful effects on all.  Children face even higher risks, both to their health and to their development.  Those with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma are particularly vulnerable.<\/blockquote> <p>One in 13 adults and one in ten children in Ireland have asthma.  The rate of deaths from asthma, contrary to international trends, are on the rise, up from 39 deaths in 2012 to a staggering 63 deaths in 2016.

However, despite an agreement being reached between the EU and the Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, the latter has decided to pause the withdrawal Bill due to the decision of MPs not to vote in favour of the timeframe set aside for the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il favours an extension to Article 50 if it avoids a no-deal Brexit and, amid the ongoing uncertainty and political chaos in Westminster, we will continue to act responsibly, to provide certainty and stability, and to put Ireland's interest first.<\/p><p>I encourage everybody to avail of the seasonal flu vaccination.

There is very little the Irish Government can be seen to do at this stage without opening itself to the accusation of interfering in English domestic politics.  If one looks at the Theresa May deal and the Boris Johnson deal, one should not be under any illusion but that trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is going to be adversely affected by the measures proposed.  I am not relying on my own instinct in relation to that.  I have listened to BBC radio and some of their economic, industrial and business organisations are expressing concerns about that.  Whereas some in Ireland may think this is the DUP getting its just desserts, if one wants Northern Ireland to prosper, as we all in our hearts do for without prosperity there will be very little chance of reconciliation, the so-called \"compromise\" worked out is worse for Northern Ireland than the original deal the DUP opposed and brought down by its alliance with the European Research Group.  It is not as if the new arrangements for Northern Ireland are good for the North.  They are not.  The DUP must share part of the blame for that while we should recognise the truth that this is not an ideal outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#H00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach apologised to women and families affected by the operation of the cervical screening programme.

We saw yesterday also that another seriously ill woman is being dragged through the courts.  While the State must fight different claims, the Taoiseach promised that these women would not be dragged through the courts.  I ask the Government to stop immediately and for the Taoiseach to fulfil the promises he made.<\/p> <p>Dr. Scally said there was a complete failure from top to bottom in the cervical screening programme and that some women and their relatives were treated appallingly.  The Leader knows as we do that the State has failed these women and that the outsourcing of smear tests has played a role in the scandal.  There must be collective Cabinet responsibility for the decision made to outsource cervical screening in the first place.  The name of the person in charge was mentioned earlier.  What bothers me is the question of whether it could happen now.  Could there be a collective Cabinet decision again where there is medical advice?  One clinician resigned at the time because he felt so strongly and he predicted exactly what would happen.  The decision made around that table was a fatal one for these women and their families.<\/p> <p>We need to see additional funding to ensure the recommendations of the MacCraith and Scally reports are implemented.  I was disappointed that the budget did not include a ring-fenced sum prior to the apology for cervical screening.  We need to have screening repatriated.  We need to have control.  We need to reverse the bad decision that was made.  We cannot let any other women down as we let Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Vicky Phelan down.

We must fix it and fix it fast.<\/p> <p>We sometimes make the greatest mistake of thinking a public or State apology means everything is okay and the doors are closed.

The pupils in one of its classes are being spread across several classrooms.

It is not necessarily only the students in the traditional disadvantaged schools that need this programme.

That is in addition to &euro;57.6 million spent on school meals in general in a given year.  I believe that figure should be expanded.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the House to discuss how the programme could be increased incrementally every year to capture as many schools as possible.

That should be examined.  Those two interventions would have a major effect and potentially could have a great impact on education.  To revert briefly to the school meals programme, it makes for nutritionally healthy and properly developed young people, gives them a quality of life, enhances their personal and holistic development and leaves them in a position to learn.  Teachers throughout this country or any country would advise that the greatest obstacle to learning is children who come to school on an empty stomach and remain that way during the day and, in some instances, perhaps have only junk food.

He told me that based on the current level of funding required to repair footpaths in the Castleblayney-Carrickmacross municipal district, it would take 20 years to carry out the repairs.  With respect to the allocation for public lighting, based on current national allocations, it will take 24 years to repair the public lighting required in the Castleblayney-Carrickmacross area.  Another councillor in the Ballybay-Clones area, Councillor S&eacute;amus Coyle, told me that based on the current levels they would need about &euro;600,000 to carry out the works on the roads that are in bad need of repair but they will only get &euro;130,000 this year to repair the roads network in that area.

It involves the fast-track planning of developments involving more than 100 units.  We see major implications arising from this.  There are implications for the Aarhus Convention in terms of public consultation, access to environmental information, which is set down and directed by the EU, and the principle of subsidiarity.  In no democracy in Europe does an independent planning appeals board such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la act as judge and jury in its own cause.  In effect, what this legislation has done is allow developers who advocate the development of more than 100 units to go direct to An Bord Plean&aacute;la thereby bypassing their local authorities, who are the statutory planning authorities.  As a result, the citizens in those communities and the city and county councils in those areas do not have any official statutory input into the commentary around these applications, although they may have input on the side.  I am not against the development of houses.  We need to build more houses and we need higher densities but we must also have regard to existing residential amenity and communities.  As politicians, we all know that we have made legitimate representations on behalf of our communities, which is our given right.  The removal of a third-party appeal process has serious implications for public participation in decision-making and that is something over which we cannot stand.

He may consider it with some adjustment, which should be encouraged, but the reality is that I do not think it is right that we as elected politicians who support local politicians who are also elected support any system that blocks or curtails their right to engage and advocate on behalf of citizens with regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of their communities.

This is a surveillance system used in child and adolescent mental health services in the UK and Ireland.  Today, we are told that up to 4,000 children and adolescents in this country between the ages of eight to 17 may be suffering from anorexia nervosa.  It is clear from the figures that the problem is escalating.  The figures have doubled since 2006.  I have dealt with a number of families with a child suffering from this condition.  I can only describe it as one of a parent's worst nightmares because there is a great feeling of helplessness on the part of the parent as he or she looks on at a child who will not and cannot eat and is damaging not just his or her mental health but his or her physical health in the process.  Parents need assistance and support.  The escalation of the problem is reflected in the increase in referrals to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, provided by the HSE, where there has been a 40% increase in referrals since 2011.  Unfortunately, staffing and resources are clearly an issue with only 57% of posts filled compared to the figure recommended by A Vision for Change.  I know there is a particular problem with acute services.  We sometimes see children admitted to hospital in a critical state and put in paediatric wards beside other ill children.  They must be supervised.  Getting counselling or dieticians is very difficult.  Could we have a debate because this is clearly a societal problem?  We hear glib comments about meat in the climate change debate.  We must be far more responsible.  We know there is a lot of pressure on young people with regard to their self-employment that they pick up from social media.  I am not an expert in this field but I feel for the children and young people and their families, as can we all.  We need a debate on attitudes to food, recognising symptoms earlier and correcting attitudes that are leading to this terrible condition to give some hope to people that they might learn that there is a way to break through and get over this condition.

That is a worthy debate which we should consider.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a fantastic project that was held in the audiovisual room by the I Wish campaign between 9. a.m. and 10 a.m. today.  It is a unique campaign that was set up to encourage women in school to take up the STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - subjects.  It has launched a survey and is trying to make us aware of the issues for females taking up science subjects.  It is something we should debate with the Minister for Education and Skills.  He attended the presentation this morning and it was welcome that he turned up.  That 93% of teachers believe that confidence is a problem for the female population in school taking up science subjects is a major issue.  We must grapple with it and find a solution.  I hope a debate with the Minister in the Seanad would go some way towards setting out a template whereby we can increase female participation in science subjects.  It is a worthy debate.  I compliment the I Wish campaign.  It is a unique campaign to visit the Oireachtas.  It brought speakers and fourth year students from throughout the country.  Hearing their stories was inspiring.  We must move forward on this.  We must invite the Minister to the Chamber and afterwards we must put a policy in place to deliver on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#L00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We seem to have two different rules.  We are allowed to serve in the Houses of the Oireachtas when we are aged over 70 years, yet I have a colleague in Carlow who is not allowed to drive a school bus.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme and has a system whereby bus drivers who reach the age of 65 years and express a desire to continue to drive can work for a further five years if they pass the medical reviews.  However, when they reach 70 years of age, they must retire from that employment.  This is ageism and discrimination.  A great driver in my constituency of Carlow is particularly aggrieved by this rule.<\/p> <p>Will the Leader ask the Minister why this appears to be acceptable in Ireland today?  We are living longer and are certainly able to work for longer.  The absence of legislation on health checks for public service drivers should be addressed as a means of dealing with this.  We must examine ways of allowing people who want to work and are able to work to do so.  A person does not reach the rubbish heap in his or her 70th year and we should not make anybody feel that this is the case.  It is unfair to have a system in which a person is not allowed to drive a Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus when he or she reaches the age of 70 years, yet that person can be a Member of the Oireachtas at any age, which is good and welcome.

We all know there is massive potential for good and that most owners of drones are law abiding, but we are also aware of the havoc caused at Gatwick Airport last December.  There was an incident in Dublin Airport last February, and in an incident that took place in Dubai, the cost to the airport and the economy of flights delayed was $86,000 per minute of disruption.<\/p> <p>There is an urgent need to fast-track legislation and for greater enforcement and greater penalties to be imposed on those who use drones in a negative and sometimes criminal way.

The answer is not to drive down standards but to look creatively at what the State and public agencies can do to solve this problem.  Such creative thinking is long overdue.  Purely market-driven thinking is not working.  I am conscious of conversations I have had recently with housing placement officers in urban county councils and city councils.  They told me how desperate it is for people.  People in the low to medium income bracket cannot get housing as they cannot afford rents or mortgages.  We must continue to debate this and have much more adventurous thinking.<\/p> <p>The issue I wish to raise is one which Senator Murnane O'Connor touched on briefly yesterday, which is our elderly population and loneliness.  She mentioned the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, whose latest report was published recently.  I am also conscious of the good work done by Senator Swanick in this area.  It would be useful to have further debate on loneliness and how it can be addressed in our society.  We are generally a social and sociable people.  We know people need other people and thrive on human connections, but in the modern world social bonds are breaking down.  We are all experiencing this.  As Senator Swanick said previously, loneliness among older people is a hidden public health crisis.  There is a certain taboo around the subject.  We should have a debate and consider what the TILDA report tells us, which is that loneliness can be exacerbated by things such as bereavement, the loss of a partner, retirement or living alone.  It is not a surprise that these matters are more of an issue as people get older, but it is interesting to see that it is as much a problem in urban areas as it is in rural areas.  The study found that 6.5% faced serious loneliness in rural areas, but it was 10% in Dublin city and county.<\/p> <p>One can understand why that might be the case.  As the report said, there are still some of the bonds of community and church to be found in rural areas.  For those who are interested in the important positive contribution faith and faith communities can make to civic life, it is interesting to note that the study states that where people have greater involvement in their local church and the practice of faith, it can help.  Mental Health Ireland has said that this can help people maintain good mental health, cope with daily stress and keep them grounded.<\/p> <p>Today, I met a woman who is involved in one of the small Protestant churches in Dublin.  She is getting on in years yet she is taking care of the children of a single mother, who is one of what is called the new Irish and who lives in that church.  The father vanished from the scene rather early.  That is all too much of a problem in Irish life that we do not discuss much.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This person was found through this particular church network.  Of course, people do not only find help through church networks, but these are the hidden heroes who are reaching out and going beyond themselves.

They help fill a real need in people's lives by taking care of children and helping out, in order that those people can do better for themselves and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#L00700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The Senator is well into injury time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I would like the House to continue debating this.

I want to reflect on last week's visit by a cross-party delegation of Senators to my home city of Belfast.  It was a very positive and worthwhile engagement, building on a series of engagements between the Seanad, the first citizens of Belfast and, by extension, Belfast City Council.  I thank and commend Senator Joe O'Reilly in particular for his eloquent and positive words to Lord Mayor John Finucane on our behalf during that visit to Belfast City Hall.  Encouragingly, he extended an invitation to members of Belfast City Council to come back down the road to re-engage in a spirit of collaboration and positive and mutual co-operation moving forward.  It is important at this time that we embed and sustain those positive links right across the entirety of our island.  I want to reflect on the positive nature of that visit.  We also visited the Somme Heritage Centre in Newtownards, run by Carol Walker, and the new James Connolly visitor centre on the Falls Road, where the manager, S&eacute;anna Walsh, looked after us.  Both centres were very informative examples of our sometimes contested but shared past and experiences.  That is also true of the last couple of days, during which the Leas-Cathaoirleach and I both attended the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  It is important that we continue those dialogues, the process of reconciliation and the quiet and respectful conversations which are taking place despite some of the hot air and reflections elsewhere.  As an institution, the Seanad must support and participate in those crucial and important conversations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I, too, want to briefly mention the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which was attended by many Members of these Houses, including the Leas-Cathaoirleach, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and me, as well as members from Westminster, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>They had to beat a hasty retreat to Westminster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The Leas-Cathaoirleach was not too bad himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00700","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I did not have to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we did not have the pleasure of their company for the full two days due to proceedings in Westminster.

It was useful to have quiet meetings and side meetings.  I know the Leas-Cathaoirleach has been distracted by Senator Devine but BIPA will be 30 years old next year, and it has been a very useful body.  I do not know whether the Leader was ever a member of that assembly, but it is well worth the twice annual visits in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where people can have brief discussions and private talks about what is going on and find out things that people might be uncomfortable saying publicly.  There are obviously sessions in public as well.<\/p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of BusConnects with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There are two aspects to BusConnects.  The first is the highly controversial bus lanes and the removal of trees, grass verges and so on, while the second is the network redesign.  BusConnects published a second version of the network redesign yesterday and many public consultation sessions will be held in November which I am highlighting in order to let the public know about them.  The Minister might come in and explain to us how he intends to deal with the significant congestion in Dublin as well as the physical aspects of changing footpaths, roads and grass verges and the destruction and removal of trees.  Equally, there is the question of the network and service redesign, which many people will find challenging initially.  It may provide a better service.  I am not saying it will not, but there will be winners and losers, and it is up to individuals to investigate what is happening in their areas and make a submission about it.  To be fair to the National Transport Authority, NTA, it has listened and taken on board many of the observations it received, but it can do much more.  It is important that people look into this to see what is happening to their service and whether it is getting better or worse.  Half of it might get better but for the other half there might be connections or bus changes involved, which may not suit.  People should have their say, and make their contributions and submissions at the sessions which are taking place throughout November at eight different locations.  This does not just affect Dublin, but the entire Dublin Bus network, which extends out to counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  I ask the Leader to schedule a discussion with the Minister, Deputy Ross, sooner rather than later, on BusConnects, public transport provision and congestion in Dublin more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M01100","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Before calling the Leader to reply, I welcome Senator Devine's niece, Ms Anne Mongey, to the Chamber, as well as &Aacute;ine, Leah and Saoirse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M01200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the 15 Members of the House who made contributions to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Senator Swanick and others raised the issue of air pollution and the related public health concerns.  It is a huge issue with which we have to grapple, as Senator Swanick quite rightly said.  Since the implementation of the smoky coal ban in Dublin and other major urban areas, lives have been saved.  We must continue to grapple with this in order to ensure this practice ends, as the Asthma Society of Ireland has done.  The Taoiseach and I have both noted there is a potential legal challenge involved, but I commend the Senator on the work he is doing in highlighting this and advocating for better air quality on the basis of public health.  I also commend Sarah O'Connor of the Asthma Society of Ireland.  World Lung Day was held recently and we learned that 4.2 million deaths occur worldwide from air pollution every year.  It is important that we continue to promulgate and promote an alternative.<\/p> <p>Senator Swanick also referred to Brexit, as did Senator McDowell.  Much is being said, written and speculated about Brexit.  We have not yet reached the end of the Brexit process, although I hope it will come soon.  As I have said previously, and as Senator McDowell noted in his comments this morning, there is no good outcome from Brexit.  Brexit is bad, full stop.  There are no winners in Brexit.  The Government has represented the people and tried to ensure that the island of Ireland is represented.<\/p> <p>Senator Swanick and others mentioned the flu vaccination.  Members and staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to avail of the flu vaccine today, and I hope people will do so.  As part of the winter readiness campaign, people should seek an alternative to visiting GP practices, and we should all support flu vaccinations.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of the Land Development Agency, as Senator Boyhan has done previously.  As I have said in the House, the legislation in question is on the Government's priority list to be published this term.  The Land Development Agency is up and running, as Senators know, and is working on eight sites with seven more in the pipeline.  John Moran has been appointed as chairman of the interim board.  The Land Development Agency's focus in recent months has been on delivering on those eight sites.  It has already engaged in advanced preliminary feasibility work on all eight sites which have a capacity to deliver 3,000 homes.  Having completed the feasibility aspect, the professional teams now must go ahead and apply for planning permission.  The sites in Skerries in County Dublin, the former St. Kevin's Hospital by the Lee Road in Cork city, and the former Devoy Barracks in Naas can provide 250, 200 and 200 homes, respectively.  In addition, the agency is also looking at other areas around Dublin.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss this.  The Bill is one part of addressing this issue but work is continuing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As Senators McDowell, Mullen, Humphreys and others stated, we must examine different models for the delivery of houses.  That could be the Berlin model or what is being worked on and achieved in Vienna, which Senator Boyhan and I recently visited with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - Parliamentary Assembly, OSCE PA.  I had a good engagement on housing when I was there.  Whatever model we look at, however, it must be able to deliver a variety of houses.  Senator McDowell has pointed out that we are spending an inordinate amount of money on HAP and rent allowance that could be used in the acquisition and development of housing.  We should have that debate and I would be happy to facilitate it.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to CervicalCheck and the apology made by the Taoiseach yesterday on behalf of the Irish nation.  It was an important day and not just about words.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has put in place a system of building blocks for the families and the victims.  We have to ensure this type of tragedy never happens again and the Minister and the Government are committed to that.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I do not think another Senator seconded it.  To be fair, Senator Humphreys made an important point.  I will have the Minister contact the Senator, as a matter of priority, after the Order of Business because the matter of the school building programme is important.  As the Senator stated, there seems to have been a change of philosophy in how the programme operates.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has a list of emerging needs.  The point the Senator made about the Shellybanks school and emerging needs is important, however, and will affect all of our areas.  I will endeavour to have a conversation with the Senator after this session and have the Minister speak to him as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M01300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>In light of the Leader's comments, I withdraw my amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#N00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will be dealing with the proposed amendment later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#N00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Senator O'Reilly referred to the school meals programme, which is an important initiative in our education system.  All of us recognise the importance of nutrition.  In the context of the development and well-being of young children in schools, it is critical that they are properly fed.  Some 36 schools were part of a pilot programme run by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection last year.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has flagged that by 2020 there will be 45 childcare settings in which hot meals will be made available.  Senator O'Reilly also referred to the school book scheme.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to House to debate that issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher made reference to the funding of public services.  I am sure every local authority would love to have more money.  I am happy for the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, to come to the House to highlight the amount of money that he has spent in this area, and for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to do likewise.  This important issue also relates to the area of transport.  I am happy to have that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of SHD and fast-track planning.  He raised these points yesterday in a very good meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Senator Boyhan is correct when he states that we must achieve a balance between powers, third-party appeals and fast-tracking.  The scheme is due to end this year, but it can be extended to 2021 by the Minister.  He stated in the D&aacute;il earlier this month that he has the report and that there will be changes.  The points made by the Senator are important because there is a feeling of disconnection in local communities and local authorities.  A variety of speakers appeared before the joint committee yesterday, including some from the Irish Planning Institute.  I am happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter and there is merit in the Senator's suggestion.<\/p> <p>Senators Mulherin and Lombard raised the issue of CAMHS, eating disorders and self-image.  That is an important matter about which we as a society must continue to have a conversation.  I am happy to have the Minister come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine raised the issue of the Shannon LNG project.  That matter was debated during the Order of Business in recent days.  I will not repeat what has already been said.<\/p> <p>Commencement matters are important and it is essential that all Members have an opportunity to put one forward.  It is disappointing if Ministers do not come into the House.  Some Ministers want to take debates and are only too happy to do so in person.  I will speak to the Government Chief Whip regarding this matter.  There may be diary issues involved, but it is not good enough to have no Minister present to address Members' Commencement matters and that Ministers cancel at short notice.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard referred to the important I Wish campaign being undertaken and spearheaded by Ms Gillian Keating and Ms Caroline O'Driscoll from Cork.  There was an excellent presentation this morning in the audiovisual room on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and the need for young girls and women take them up in schools.  I am happy to have that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of drivers who are more than 70 years of age.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a policy centred on drivers reaching the age of 65.  That is extended for part-time and private workers.  There is a facility for those drivers to continue beyond the age of 70, provided they have licences and are certified by their doctors.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann age limit was extended.  This might be more appropriately dealt with by means of a Commencement matter to which the Minster for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, could reply.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Mahony raised the issue of the Irish Aviation Authority and the importance of a policy on drones.  We saw what happened in respect of this issue last February.  I am happy for the Minister to come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen referred to the Irish longitudinal study on ageing and the matter of loneliness raised yesterday by Senator Murnane O'Connor.  Loneliness is the unspoken issue for many middle-aged and older people.  I would be happy to have that debate.<\/p> <p>Regarding the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I thank Senator O'Reilly for deputising for me last week in Belfast.  I regret that I was unable to be there because of a diary clash with an event where I was speaking in Cork.  It is important that links are forged in this regard and I know that Senator McDowell's group was in Belfast before the summer recess.  It is important for the Upper House to have links and build relationships, and we are very well represented by Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Marshall in the North.  I hope we can develop those links further.<\/p> <p>Turning to Senator Horkan, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly will be 30 years old next year.  Regarding BusConnects, we will have that debate in due course.  An interim report was published yesterday, so I am sure there will be much lengthy debate in the next couple of weeks.  <\/p> <p>I thank Senator Humphreys for withdrawing his amendment.  I welcome the Leas-Chathaoirleach's daughter and granddaughters to the House.  They should be very proud of their dad and grandfather because he is a magnificent person and we are very proud of him.

Before inviting Senators to contribute, I extend a very warm welcome to Feargal&rsquo;s wife, Denise, to his children, Gilliane, Eamonn and Zoe, his sister Eilagh and his extended family.  I also welcome his former staff members, Anne and Bairbre.  Also in attendance today are his former Seanad colleagues, Dr. Se&aacute;n Barrett and Dr. Maurice Manning.  On behalf of the Members of the Seanad, I express again our sincere sympathy to all our guests, and I hope that since his death in April, they have been able in their own ways to come to terms with their sad loss.<\/p> <p>Feargal Quinn was a unique individual.  He was a deeply committed and respected public servant, as well as a highly successful businessman.  He was born into a business family so his work ethic was therefore instilled in him at an early age.  In Skerries he shone shoes, waited tables and cleaned dishes in the kitchens.  No job was beneath him.  His down-to-earth approach never left him and he built a brand based on the personal touch, known for its quality and service.  He showed his business acumen from an early age and after graduating from University College Dublin, he opened his first supermarket in Dundalk at the age of 23.  This was the start of a very successful career in retail.<\/p> <p>His contribution to the Irish retail market was matched by his outstanding public service.  He was chairman of An Post throughout the 1980s and he brought his hands-on approach to that role as well.  I understand that during his first week he worked a full shift delivering post to homes in full postman uniform.  He had a deep commitment to charity.  Even in the busiest period for retail at Christmas, he was aware of the needs of others and found time to give away hampers in inner-city Dublin.  He became the driving force behind the annual Mansion House Christmas day dinner.<\/p> <p>His appointment to the Seanad in 1993 began a 23-year career in this House, where he was highly respected as an Independent Senator.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Leas-Chathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->His commitment to the Seanad was total, not least in the many Bills he tabled in the House, including the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 to protect building subcontractors, which became law after being supported by the Government of the day. <\/p><p>He did not need the Seanad.  He did not take the salary, which I understand he donated to charity.  He took his place here because of his deep commitment to Ireland and democracy.  He will, of course, be remembered for his central role in the referendum campaign to prevent the abolition of the Seanad in 2013.  As a businessman, writer, television personality, public servant and Senator, Feargal Quinn was a hugely popular figure in Irish life.<\/p><p>Personally, he was hugely likeable, pleasant, friendly and good-humoured.  He had a sense of integrity, decency and honesty that guided him throughout his life.  I might add I was impressed with his sense of style.  I always admired his very colourful ties and socks, although I was never brave enough to go down that road myself.  He was great fun.  Feargal was a Member of this House for 23 years from 1993 to 2016.  I had the privilege of serving here with him as a Member of the House.  He was an honourable gentleman and a true family man.  His family were at the centre of it all.  He could have opted for a quieter life but, instead, he took up the challenge and commitment of being a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This House was the poorer for his departure on his retirement and Ireland is the poorer for his loss.

His loss to his family is immense.  His loss to Irish democracy is also immense.  His loss to Irish society, the economy and the wider Republic in which he lived is immense.<\/p><p>I first came into touch with Feargal Quinn when he was simply a successful businessman and I was a lawyer.  Later, when I became a Minister and came to appreciate the virtues of this House, I dealt with him on a number of matters.  I found him to be courteous, patriotic and unfailingly decent in all his dealings with his colleagues and the wider general public.  He was a member of the Independent group and it is a great honour today to speak on behalf of that group in tribute to Feargal Quinn.<\/p><p>He believed in Irish democracy.  Many people who had achieved as much as he did in business would have rested on their laurels and done nothing further in their lives, but he, as the Leas-Cathaoirleach said, determined that he would devote a very considerable portion of his life from 1993 onwards to the service of Irish democracy.  As the Leas-Cathaoirleach pointed out, he did so while eschewing his salary simply because he believed in the contribution he could make, as a successful businessman, to this Chamber. <\/p><p>He was a man of very strong views, even though he was a man of immense gentility.  He was more conservative than, say, I would be, but he never allowed his conservative views on moral matters to obtrude in his dealings with others with whom he might have disagreed.  As the Leas-Cathaoirleach pointed out, he was a man who spent many hours engaged in charitable work in this city and elsewhere.<\/p><p>Most importantly, he really devoted himself to making sure that this Chamber worked effectively to do the work which the Constitution envisaged for it.  When the proposal to abolish this Chamber came into the public domain, he contacted me because he knew I was opposed to the measure and, with the late Noel Whelan, the current Minister, Deputy Zappone, and Dr. Brian Hunt, who is here today, we, in our small way, contributed to the campaign to preserve the Seanad.  Other people, including Senator Norris, did Trojan work as well.  The crucial thing was that when Senator Quinn, as he then was, went out into the streets of Irish towns and cities, he swung that campaign by simply being the man he was and reminding people of the value of this House.  Although his health was not good at that time, and he was not capable of sustained campaigning, he pretended that he was in perfect health, and he posed for photographs and the like as if he was a youngster.  He made it very clear to all those who met him - and crowds flocked to him - that he was there to sell them the message that Irish democracy was about to be damaged in a very serious way by the abolition of this House, and he appealed to them to vote to retain this House. <\/p><p>I know that the last article he wrote for <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>just a week before he died, which was published the day after his funeral, pleaded with the Government of the day to deliver on reforming this House and making sure it plays its full part.  Although those reforms may be a matter of controversy from time to time, it is undoubtedly the case that, having saved this House, as he did, we owe him the duty at least to take his posthumously published article seriously and to do something to make this House more effective as a Chamber of the Irish Parliament.<\/p><p>Former Senators Maurice Manning and Se&aacute;n Barrett are here, and I want to pay tribute to them as Members of this House who have always had its interests at heart.  Most of all, I want to finish on a point to the extended Quinn family here today, and I put on my most colourful tie for the occasion, though I draw the line at the socks.  I want to say to the Quinn family that we are deeply grateful to them for what their father, grandfather, husband and brother has done for Irish society.  Although it is hardly necessary to say it, on the occasion that I launched his recent biography at his request, it struck me that his family meant the most to him.  Of all his relations and all his achievements, his family represented his greatest love and his greatest priority.  On behalf of the Independent group, and I think I speak on behalf of everybody in this House, I thank the Quinn family most sincerely for what Feargal Quinn did for Irish democracy.  His gentle smile, his gentle nature, are always living in our hearts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#P00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I welcome Feargal Quinn's family, friends and former colleagues to the House.  I wish to pay tribute to him.  I got to know him not as long ago as Senator McDowell perhaps, but in 2011.  Obviously, I knew of him but I got to know him personally when I was first elected here.  He was extremely kind to me as a new member of the Seanad, very encouraging and always courteous.  He was a lesson to me on how we should interact with one another, as politicians in this country.  Sometimes the level of discourse does descend, but it is something that never happened with Feargal Quinn.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I learned a lot from speaking to him, but also from observing him in the Chamber.  As I mentioned to some of his family outside, he had a way of drawing people into what he had to say by using examples concerning his grandchildren and direct family.  I always found that very endearing but it was also a clever way to make sure people were listening to what he was saying.<\/p><p>Feargal Quinn was warm, witty and decent.  He also had all the other qualities Senator McDowell described.  He was a very proud resident of Howth.  I am lucky enough to live in Howth and I know how well regarded Feargal was all over the country, but especially in that part of Dublin.  Most people are extremely proud to have known and worked with him.  As Senator McDowell said, having built the Superquinn brand to what it was, he still maintained his service to the country.  That is highly admirable.<\/p><p>As has been said, Feargal served in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for 23 years.  I observed his involvement in many extremely constructive Bills.  That went on over the course of those years.  His tenacity and passion were always clearly evident.  As one can see from television programmes, he always wanted to help others in small business to achieve and to improve their businesses.  The reason he was so well regarded around the country was that people could relate to him as having worked so hard and having been so good to people.  <\/p><p>As I said, Feargal Quinn's style of communication impressed me.  He was a really lovely colleague, and I would not say that about everyone in politics, although everyone in the Chamber today is lovely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#P00300","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Senator Noone should leave the Fine Gael crowd alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#Q00200","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>It is sometimes said that, unfortunately, we often wait until people pass away to say nice things about them, but I always felt this way about Feargal Quinn.

There are not many people who have the greater good at heart in reality, but Feargal Quinn was a man who did.  He is a profound loss to this family, who no doubt miss him every day.

Today is a sad occasion for the family of Feargal Quinn and his former colleagues here in the Upper House, where he distinguished himself.  I hope, however, that it is also a moment of pride.  It is an opportunity for those of us who shared this space in our Parliament with him to pay tribute and due respect to one of our best.  The former Senator leaves behind a legacy that stretches across both business and politics and into the lives of those who knew him.  He made an immense contribution, characterised by charity, civic duty and innovation.  In Superquinn, he built up a remarkable business.  His relentless emphasis on customer service created a unique shopping experience that transformed commerce in Ireland.  For his many employees, he created a business that enabled them to live a good life with a decent job.  All through this, his personal characteristics of kindness and decency shone through in the rough and tumble of the business world.  His energy and the example he set for all of his staff became a model that other business owners admired.  He was a firm advocate of Irish enterprise at home and abroad.  We could not have hoped for a more energetic or enthusiastic supporter of our national interests.<\/p><p>From the world of business, Feargal Quinn threw himself headlong into the equally tough area of politics and, once more, distinguished himself.  He introduced 17 Bills, marking himself out as a prolific legislator who pinpointed issues.  He deftly worked with others to achieve his aims and passed a series of laws that helped to better the lot of the Irish people.  On the deeply competitive university panel, his appeal continuously shone through.  He set the standard that others on that panel strive to achieve to this day.  As Senator McDowell alluded to, when this House stood on the precipice of political oblivion in 2013, Feargal Quinn stood up to defend it.  Rather than joining in with a populist slash-and-burn approach to pillars of our shared democracy, he held firm.  He outlined, with sharp clarity of thought and his own remarkable lived model of political life, the crucial role the Upper House plays in our democracy.  Our presence here today is a result of his boundless energy and ceaseless efforts.  All those who take their seats today are challenged to live up to his tremendous example.  <\/p><p>I will pick out a few points Feargal Quinn made in his final contribution to this House on 3 February 2016.  This contribution is worth reading for anyone who has not read it in its entirety.  He said: &quot;I have been involved in a number of careers but in this one every single day from the first time I came into this House I have been fortunate enough to get a sense of achievement and satisfaction.&quot;  Later in his contribution, he said:<\/p><blockquote>Years ago, I remember being asked to explain the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; in five words or fewer.  We spoke about it a lot and came up with, &ldquo;Management is getting results through other people&rdquo;.  That is what I have learned here in this House.  It is about the ability of the Government, this and the other House to get results through other people.  I found listening and getting results on that basis has been a huge success.  It could not have taken place, however, without the enthusiasm, commitment and the dedication of so many people, both who work here and who have been elected to this House.<\/blockquote> <p>In the final sentence of his contribution he said: &quot;I certainly intend to maintain my interest in what is going on here in the years ahead.&quot;  I was thinking of a few of the stand-out moments I remember of Feargal, apart from the fact that he was the man to patent the effectiveness of socks, long before the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was even born.  Both the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senator McDowell have alluded to this, and to Feargal's beautiful ties.  I remember he once said that during his business career he had been working between 18 and 20 hours a day and eventually decided he needed to take up a hobby that would take him out of the office.  He did not want the other staff or management to know that he was taking a break, so he purchased a horse and named it &quot;Business&quot; so that when anybody inquired as to where he was, his secretary could say he was out on Business.  <\/p><p>Feargal Quinn had a major difficulty with promotions from various bodies, such as television companies, Sky News, sporting channels or whatever, offering great discounts to new customers while paying no attention to existing customers.  He could not cope with this.  It bothered him to such an extent that he used to unsubscribe from some of these services and then subscribe in the name of his wife, Denise, to avail of the incentives.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He stressed to us all the difference between best-by dates and use-by dates.  It is something on which he encouraged us all to educate ourselves and the public.  He said it would lead to far less food wastage.  He questioned the logic of changing the clock in summer and winter, something which we discussed recently.  He was partly responsible for the change to how we receive the Order Paper, which was put in a brown envelope and put in our pigeonholes every sitting day.  We can get it now on the Internet.<\/p><p>Feargal was a very decent and honourable man, dapper, as he has been described by many, and who always carried his briefcase.  When he walked in through the door, one would know by the speed he was walking at whether he was in good or bad humour, or whether the Government was going to get it.  I learned that as a former Government Chief Whip.  One is able to read the body language of people that one might be depending on for a vote.<\/p><p>It was an honour for me to serve with him from 2002 to 2016.

He never asked anyone to do anything that he would not do himself.  That was a testament to the man.  I remember his great war cry, which I think was also the title of one of his books: the customer is king.  That was Feargal Quinn all over.<\/p> <p>I sat beside him in the House for many years.  He was always gentlemanly.  Even if one was disagreeing with him, he never lost his cool.  He was always an immensely courteous man.<\/p> <p>He was deeply religious.  That is something people have not referred to yet.  He was deeply religious in a very genuine sort of way.  He was, I believe, Supreme Knight of the Knights of St. Columbanus, and he was very proud of the papal knighthood that was conferred upon him.  He used to wear the rosette in the House with great pride and distinction.  I was a guest in the Cosmos Club in Washington some years ago and I was presented with the rosette of the club.  It was a very distinguished place.  Practically all its members were Nobel prize winners in science of some kind, so I was something of a lame duck there.  Just for fun, I wore the rosette.  Feargal's eyes nearly unscrewed themselves from his face when he saw it, and he could not resist asking me what this was?  I told him it was a papal knighthood but His Holiness told me I had to be very discreet about it.  The look on Feargal's face was absolutely priceless.<\/p> <p>He was meticulous in his contributions.  I will always remember, because I sat beside him for many years, that he always had his notes typed out and double-spaced.  They presented him with the groundwork for his argument.  He introduced an enormous number of Bills as a private Member, I think more than any other Member of this House.  That was a very significant contribution.

He was an ebullient businessman, entrepreneur and innovator, but most importantly to his family he was a loving father, brother, and grandfather.<\/p><p>Feargal Quinn was an innovator in the Irish retail sector.  No one needs me to tell them that.  He brought about new levels of customer service.  Even for people like me who never met Feargal Quinn, I felt that I knew him.  We watched him and followed him and listened to what he had to say.  He will be remembered for the likes of the loyalty cards, the self-scanning, coupled with the famous high-level customer service and the stand out products.  We all know about the Superquinn pork sausages.  I think SuperValu still retains them.  He was a leader and he treated his staff like a family and valued them as much as the customer.  When Senator Wilson was talking about the customer and how Feargal Quinn appreciated existing customers, it reminded me of the insurance companies.  They could certainly learn a thing or two from Feargal Quinn in terms of customer service.  He encouraged staff to progress and to find a passion in retail as much as he did.  He really showed what can be done when one aligns passion with purpose.<\/p><p>Feargal Quinn seems to have gone out of his way to brighten everybody's day.  It was really evident.  His levels of emotional and social intelligence were there for all to see.  He clearly invested in the happiness and well-being of his staff.  I was speaking to a former staff member of Superquinn yesterday and I mentioned Feargal Quinn.  A smile came to her face and she said he was such a lovely man.  He was great to work for and always had a smile on his face.  She said she loved when he visited the store, that he was inspirational to them all, and that he valued them as employees.  She said that still to this day in any work she does, she always remembers the values he taught them in customer care.  It is more than 20 years since that person worked in the company but it shows the impact that can have on someone years later.  Is that not what we would wish or aspire to for all of us?  This is what Feargal Quinn was to many people.  He put the needs of the customer first and foremost, and he transformed the retail landscape.<\/p><p>As a Senator for 23 years he was a strong voice for the national business community and a force for change.  He was, as was mentioned earlier, passionate about Seanad reform.  I cannot recall an Irish businessman who is more fondly remembered by those who met him.  Senator McDowell referred earlier to his article in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  Senator Boyhan shared it with me earlier.  Something really stood out for me in terms of leadership, some of the global leadership we see now, and some of the people who are in positions of leadership who could learn a thing or two from Feargal Quinn.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What he said was that leadership is not about marching in step with the <i>status quo<\/i>.

I cannot imagine how much they miss him but I hope they take some solace from the legacy of care, compassion and leadership that he has left us all.

We worked together, along with Senator McDowell and others, in the campaign to save the Seanad in 2013, long before I thought I might ever become a Senator.  As previous speakers stated, he spoke with such warm and passion about the Seanad, not only what it was but also what it could become.  He was an incredibly powerful advocate for the Seanad at that time and a wonderfully gracious person.<\/p> <p>I did not have the opportunity of serving with Feargal Quinn in the Seanad.  We have heard Senators speak of him warmly, and they also speak with great warmth in between times about working and serving with him.  I was, however, placed in his office for my first few weeks in the Oireachtas.  I saw in the labelled shelves in his office a level of meticulous organisation I will never match.  One could see in how well organised his office was the attention and thought that went in to every aspect of his work, from personal communications through to his legislative work.<\/p> <p>What I know best is some of the legislation he brought forward.  It is an incredible achievement to have introduced 17 Bills, some of which, for example, his legislation on subcontractors and their rights and on health, are now well known.  It was clear that health was an area of passion for Feargal Quinn.  He did work on access to defibrillators, which were not common or understood at the time, organ donation and other issues.  We are still debating some of these issues in the House and seeking to implement adequate legislation areas that support people's health.  There was a level of care and concern in his legislation.<\/p> <p>When I was working on the area of privacy, I was struck by how current Feargal Quinn was.  Only days before he retired from the Seanad, he introduced legislation on drones and was looking at legislation on privacy.  He was always up to the minute and concerned with new and emerging issues.  I say that because that work matters.  It leaves traces and affects the debates and decisions that happen here today.<\/p> <p>I knew that part of him but when I went to his funeral I learned about many other parts of him that I did not know about.  The colour and warmth he brought to the lives of his family were clear from his colourful ties and that came across beautifully.  It was also clear how loved he was in the world of business.  I was struck by a few points that seemed to echo what I saw in him as a Senator.  His strong and gracious voice in debate, which has been recognised and spoken about by previous speakers, was clear to those who spoke to him.  I was struck that the Mandate trade union spoke about him as somebody with whom they could work with respect and that he embraced unions in his company.  That was an important tribute from those who would have been adversaries at times but who also recognised the respect he showed.<\/p> <p>People spoke about having been managed by him.  They spoke of the faith he placed in them and the potential he saw in them.  That was the potential he saw in this House.  It is why he was passionate about Seanad reform as well.  He was excited about the idea.  Even in his last speech, he said that the House could not happen without enthusiasm.  He said: \"If we are going to succeed, we have to continue with the commitment, the dedication and the enthusiasm which I have seen here during the years.\"  He wanted everyone to be enthusiastic about the Seanad and he trusted everybody to be interested in debating issues in a different way and in the Seanad bringing a different perspective.  That is echoed as well.<\/p> <p>All of those strands, all of that enthusiasm for life, business, his family and what Ireland could and should be, have carried through.  While the work of Seanad reform, which he pushed for, has not yet delivered, we will continue to campaign for that as well.<\/p> <p>It is an honour to serve on the panel which Feargal Quinn served so graciously for such a long time.  On behalf of the Civil Engagement group, I pay tribute to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#S00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I extend my deepest sympathies to the Quinn family and all of the friends of the former Senator, Feargal Quinn. When he gave his last address to the House, he used one of his seanfhocail, &eacute;ist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhfaidh t&uacute; breac or listen to the sound of the river and you will get the trout.  This reflected his philosophy in life, which was to listen and then to achieve.  He spoke of the 17 Bills he had proposed.  He succeeded in having one of the last Bills he introduced passed in his name.  We should bear in mind that he is one of only six Senators who have passed a Bill while in opposition in the history of the Seanad.  That tells us the level of his achievement.  Although we all introduce Bills, very few Opposition Members manage to get them passed.  He also pointed out that some of the Bills that he introduced were reintroduced or taken on by the Government and implemented in other forms.  He did not go on about what those were but he knew that he instigated the debate on them.  That, in itself, is a legacy.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins referred to Feargal Quinn's Bill on organ donation, which is an issue he brought to my attention and on which he was a strong advocate.  He and I managed to conspire one summer to ruin everyone's holidays, including his own, such was his enthusiasm for the Bill because we found a mechanism to debate the first legislation ever introduced here on organ donation through an obscure rule of the House which required 20 signatures, of which, of course, Feargal's was the first.  We got 19 other signatures before encountering a slight problem.  On the day we were supposed to submit the technical letter recalling the Seanad, the Clerk of the Seanad rang me to say we had not lodged the motion and we needed two signatures.  I live in County Kerry.  I would not have got up to Dublin to lodge the letter by 5 p.m. so I rang around.  No one answers the phone in August but Feargal Quinn answered and asked me where he should meet my staff.  The staff had to go out to his house with the document, which he then signed and it was submitted on time, thus ruining, unfortunately, everybody's holidays and resulting in the recall of the Seanad.  We lost the vote, by the way, on the casting vote of the Chair.  We had a major debate on organ donation that August.  The night before that debate, the Government, which was in a panic because of Feargal Quinn's signature and his knowledge of the process, appointed two organ donor co-ordinators because it wanted to say it had done something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#S00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>That is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#S00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Subsequent to the debate, 20 more staff were appointed.

I will talk about some of the personal encounters I had with him.  Before I do so, I welcome Denise and her family and all the Members in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  I also welcome the visitors and former Senators in the other Visitors Gallery.<\/p> <p>I met Feargal more than 42 years ago.  At the age of 11 I worked in a little bakery called Molloys on Mount Merrion Avenue.  Superquinn was getting going.  It had a fantastic big new store opening in Blackrock.  Inevitably, Molloys off-licence started to close and, as another year went on, Molloys bakery closed.  I cleaned and scrubbed the floor in Molloys bakery after school.  Someone suggested that the bakery was to close and that I would need to get myself an after-school job quickly.  I arrived at the new Superquinn store - as I said, more than 40 years ago - and met a lady manager there who told me I would need to speak to somebody else, namely, a manager, and I did.  I told her my story and I started a week later.  This was just an after-school job in Blackrock.<\/p> <p>Feargal used to do his tours of his shops then.  He would put on his hat if he was behind the bakery counter, the meat counter or wherever else.  He took the time to visit his stores.  We never quite knew when he would come but he came to a number of stores all over Dublin and got his hands dirty in the real business of retailing.  He loved customers and loved people.  I remember him stopping me one day, apologising and telling me he had meant to introduce himself to me the previous week when he had seen me.  I told him the story of how I got the job.  I told him Molloys was to close in two weeks' time.  He asked whether many other people would lose their jobs there.  I said \"Yes\".  He said that that was what competition did, that in the case of a big store there were other stores around it.  We know the stores in that area as Blackrock Shopping Centre today.  It is currently being renovated.  I said I would bring someone from Molloys to Superquinn.  Feargal said \"No\", that I should bring them all down and that they were entitled at least to an interview.  There was a feeling that these jobs hinged on the interview, but they did not.  I was reminded of this encounter with Feargal in looking back over his life in recent months.  How would one describe him?  He was a facilitator, a motivator and an organiser.  He cared fundamentally about people.  That was his innate skill.<\/p> <p>Many people will not be aware of the following, so I will share it with the House.  Feargal employed many people who came from the Magdalen laundries in south County Dublin.  He took a particular interest in the people who grew up in Madonna House in Stillorgan.  I think of one particular woman, whom I will call Lily.  He gave her a job in Blackrock and trained her.  She said she would not really be fit for anything more than work in the back of the store.  Feargal asked why not and told her she could come right through the ranks of Superquinn.  She was not good at reading or writing, she said, and had literally no numeracy.  Feargal encouraged her and arranged for her to go to the vocational school in Stillorgan.  She did what we would call writing and sums.  Feargal motivated and tutored her.  When he took people on, he did not let them down.  He saw them through.  I spoke to Lily recently.  She said that for years after that, Feargal Quinn always sent her a birthday card.  She did not have parents.  She did not know where she came from.  She grew up in care, she said.  She got a job, however, and spent years working for Feargal.<\/p> <p>One of the hardest decisions she had to deal with was when Feargal one day said he would like to see her up in his office, where he said he wanted her to move out of Blackrock.  She said she could not.  This was her life.  Her friends were there.  She lived in a little bedsitter down the road.  She was happy.  She asked Feargal not to move her.  He said he wanted to move her over to the shop on Sundrive Road.  This was a promotion.  He realised, however, that she had to be stretched and pushed on if she was to grow and gain in confidence.  That was Feargal.  He believed in people.  He saw the potential and capacity in them and he saw these qualities in her.  She moved over to the Sundrive Road shop and got a little flat in Kimmage, thanks to Feargal.  She said to me one day that she still had the little television table she had got in Dockrells, thanks to Feargal Quinn.  He did not go around telling people all about this.  I suggest to the House that much of the reason for his not doing so was that he had fundamental Christian principles, which we in politics do not seem to talk about very much today, although someone referred to them earlier.  Feargal was ultimately Christian and a humanitarian.  He believed in responding to people's needs in everything he did.<\/p> <p>I will touch on his very famous programme, \"Retail Therapy\", with which I was particularly impressed.  He loved that programme.  He went around the country, visiting in particular the little family stores and provincial towns.  He helped the shop owners rejig their stores, make them more relevant and boost their business.  He was passionate about provincial towns.  He loved them.  He saw the potential in the small family business that offered quality and service.  It was not always about price.  It was about quality and service.  He loved doing that programme.<\/p> <p>I wish to acknowledge his work on saving the Seanad because perhaps we have not acknowledged it enough in the past.  I will not look back on those who advocated abolition.  The Seanad is here today thanks to Feargal and a few other people.  It is important we acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>Many years after I first met Feargal, I met him in the corridors of these Houses, down in the coffee shop.  He asked me what I was doing here, and I said I was thinking about running for the Seanad.  I was a former Progressive Democrat county councillor.  We talked about the past because he remembered me.  He said he wanted to nominate me.  He nominated Michael McDowell.  He had dual nomination rights as a university Senator.  I received a call asking me to come out to Santry.  Denise may remember this because she was there at the time.  He wanted to speak to me.  I went out to Santry hospital before the election.  I went downstairs to the reception.  The woman at reception asked me who I was looking for.  I did not want to shout too loudly that I was looking for Feargal Quinn.  She rang Feargal, who said he wanted me to come up to him, and I did so.  He had his nomination there in the hospital.  He joked that he wanted to sign it before having his epidural because he might not have another opportunity.  I told him I was really honoured that, having worked for him as a boy, I was there at his request and his invitation to get his nomination.<\/p> <p>Feargal asked me to do something else.  He asked me to get four independent nominees to support me in seeking election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He was proud of independence and of the fact that one could be effective in the Houses of the Oireachtas without having to take a party whip.  He really believed in that.  He did not have to offend anyone but he was proud of his independence and the fact that he was not subject to a party whip.  I asked him if he could give me one piece of advice.  He told me to remember one thing.  One comes into politics with one's integrity and, by golly, one should go out with it.  He told me that anyone who does that will be very successful.  He told me to be independent-minded, not afraid to challenge, to speak up and to advocate, to be important and to be oneself.  We see the world from where we stand and our experiences in it.  I think I have used that expression often here.  I have no doubt that Feargal's personal experiences as a child, growing up in business and within his family, had an impact on him.  He brought this to bear because he was human, humane and a humanitarian in all he did.<\/p> <p>I was greatly honoured that he should nominate me and greatly honoured and privileged by his advice, which was to be true to oneself, work hard, advocate for people at a disadvantage and go on and do my best in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  More importantly than anything, I thank him and his extended family for giving me and hundreds of other people a chance and an opportunity.  We all need a leg up and a tap on the shoulder.  We all need to be encouraged.  We all need affirmation and a belief in ourselves and our capacity to bring good and to do good.  I learned most of that from Feargal Quinn.  I thank Denise and Feargal's family for giving us so much of Feargal's time, their family's time, their family's lifetime.  More importantly, I thank them for his service to the institutions of this State, to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to business and to people such as Lily and hundreds of others who got the start, the gentle word, the guidance and the advice and who were never forgotten by Feargal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#T00100","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I call the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Paddy Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#T00150","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I wish to say to Senator Boyhan that the former Senator, Feargal Quinn, was a very practical man.

I welcome former Senators Maurice Manning, Sean Barrett and Fiach MacConghail.  It is not often that we have expressions of sympathy to families that are also attended by former Members so it shows the high esteem in which former Senator Feargal Quinn was held not just in this House but throughout the State.  <\/p><p>Feargal Quinn brought a wealth of knowledge from the business community to this Chamber.  He did not just bring knowledge from the business end.  He brought knowledge from his experience of working in semi-State bodies, including the chairmanship of An Post.  He brought all that knowledge into this Chamber and it was of great assistance to Members of this House in making decisions.  When Feargal Quinn voted in this Chamber, he did not always vote with the Government and neither did he always vote against it.  He always voted based on what he thought was best regardless of whether the Government or his colleagues liked it or not.  He voted with his conscience and he voted for what he thought was best for the State.  <\/p><p>He is a great loss to Irish society.  He loved to tell us the stories about being in the supermarkets helping the customers to pack their trolleys and put their shopping into their cars.  That was more to do with finding out what the housekeeper wanted.  It was a great way of finding out what she wanted and how fresh the product was so he had first-hand knowledge of his business from meeting customers, getting trolleys for them and helping them to their cars.  <\/p><p>He was a very practical man who spoke in very practical terms.  It was a great honour to have served in the Chamber with him.  I was elected to the Seanad on the same day as Feargal Quinn in 1993.  He was a great advocate, as previous speakers have noted, for the retention of this House and played a leading role in that.  We can see the amount of legislation he brought through the House.  Seventeen Bills is a significant number of Bills for anybody to take through this House.  There are probably Ministers who have gone through the Houses without taking any legislation through the D&aacute;il or this House so his value to the State with regard to legislation that has been passed or brought forward is not to be underestimated.   <\/p><p>He was a great golfer and loved to play golf in Portmarnock early in the morning with his wife Denise.  He often told me that it cleared his head for the day ahead.  He sponsored the Oireachtas turkey competition every November or December leading up to Christmas.  We used to have a great night in the D&aacute;il restaurant when the Superquinn vouchers were given out.  We had many great nights with Feargal Quinn.  I, again, wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his wife Denise and his family.  May he rest in peace.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#T00200","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I express my sympathy to Denise and Feargal's family on behalf of the Labour Senators.  Listening to the array of tributes paid by other colleagues in the Seanad, I am struck by the really moving stories of the immense influence Feargal Quinn had on so many across this House and beyond, the way he encouraged and promoted people and was always so courteous and kind to people.  That really fits my own memory of Feargal.  I was honoured to serve with him in the Seanad between 2007 and the last election and was part of the group of Independent Senators with him for some time.  Although we did not always agree politically, I always got on so well with him.  He was always so kind.  Others have noted how he was always courteous and how he was a real gentleman.  He also had a lovely mischievous sense of humour as exemplified by the colourful socks and tie.  It is a pity that Senator McDowell did not emulate Senator Quinn's socks because they added a lovely touch to life and business in the Seanad Chamber.<\/p> <p>He was always extremely professional.  Others have spoken about his enormous workload and the number of Private Members' Bills he brought forward.  Key to the way he worked in the Seanad was always being co-operative, working on a cross-party basis and seeking to ensure consensus and to bring forward legislation.  <\/p> <p>He was very good at mentoring newer Senators, of whom I was one.  I remember him telling me not to mind how short the space of time I had to speak was and to always just make my point in as succinct a way as possible.  He was a master of that.  If someone asked him whether he would share time with him or her, he would always be happy to do so because he was able to get often very complex points across in a very short space of time.  I will take that advice and finish on that point.  I will just say how much we miss him in the Seanad and how much affection he was held in by all of us here and beyond.  I remember canvassing with him when we campaigned during the referendum on the retention of the Seanad.  I saw how people flocked to him in Dublin city centre because he was held in such esteem and regarded with affection by so many people.  I repeat how much we sympathise with his family to whom we offer our sympathies and how much we miss him here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#U00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I welcome the Quinn family and am thankful for the opportunity to pay tribute to Feargal Quinn.  In a situation like this, I am most envious of my colleagues for the way they can speak most eloquently here in the Chamber about Feargal Quinn.  I am really envious because I never met him.  However, I had a special interaction with him about 25 years ago.  I ask Senators to cast their minds back a few decades to the old shop in Dublin, which would have a grocery part and a post office.  I married into such a family business.  It was the time when there was a counter with about half a dozen people working behind it who would serve bread, particularly in the poor area where the shop I am thinking of was located.  It sold lots of bread, margarine and things that would fill up children in the area.  <\/p> <p>The shop evolved, particularly when my husband took over.  It became one of those &pound;5 shopping basket shops.  Supermarkets were around at that time but people started to have cars so they could travel to different supermarkets around the city.  Our business went down with each passing week.  I remember having the bright idea of writing to Feargal Quinn to ask for his advice on what we should do. I was more than surprised when I got a letter back from him.  It was an A4 handwritten letter.  He also included a copy of his book.  I have no recollection of what he wrote in that letter.  All I can remember is the pride and astonishment I felt at getting that letter from such a man.  It was pinned up on our staff notice board until it curled and became yellow.  Even though I probably did not follow any of his advice, I had to say that this highlighted the person he was.  He took time out for people like me, a nobody.  We were just one of the crowd yet he wrote to me in person.  It was such a lovely gesture that has remained with me all my life.  I will always try to make time for people like he did.  <\/p> <p>When my father died, I was hungry for stories about him so that his memory would not only stay alive for me but I would learn about aspects of him I probably never knew.

People recognise the esteem in which he is held by ordinary people.  I remember when he opened the shop in Naas and even though Dunnes Stores is there now, it is still known as the Superquinn site.

From 1995 to the present day, Feargal Quinn has been responsible for gatherings in my house on a Saturday or a Sunday when we sit down and enjoy the Superquinn sausages.  He developed a sausage that cannot be beaten, although I do not know if my cardiologist would necessarily agree with him.  The next time I thought of Feargal Quinn was during the debate to save the Seanad.  I never dreamed that I would, one day, be sitting beside the icon himself but he saved the Seanad and, for those of us who wanted to enter this House, he created an opportunity to do so.  Before I took my seat, one of my sisters remarked to me, \"Oh my God, you are going to meet Feargal Quinn and David Norris\".  They are two icons.  Feargal was a small man in stature but he was a giant in Irish society, a massive man.<\/p> <p>I would love to have the stories about Feargal Quinn which some of my colleagues have but I only knew him for a very short time.  I had the privilege of speaking on two of his Bills.  One was on the awards system for Irish citizens and the other was on drones.  I taught in information technology for 25-odd years and drone technology was really exciting to me.  One would wonder why somebody would one want to condemn it but he convinced me, in just 15 minutes, of the dangers of these devices, which can sneak around people's back gardens, look in house windows and do various other things, so I spoke in favour of his Bill.<\/p> <p>What stands out for me is the humanity of the man.  He could talk to a checkout operator or to a king - it really did not matter and he treated them all the same.  The great shame is that his wonderful books are not among the marketing textbooks in our universities, because he could teach a lot to some of the marketing authors I read.  When my first granddaughter was born, Feargal got word of it and stood up behind me in the Seanad to congratulate me, although I had nothing to do with it.  He welcomed my granddaughter to the world and we will cherish, forever, the little video clip of him doing so.  It will mean an awful lot to my granddaughter in years to come when she understands the man, the icon, who welcomed her into the world.  In the last speech he made in this House, he took a few seconds to mention me and, for that, I will be extremely grateful.  I am terribly sorry I did not get to know the man better.  I never dreamed I would sit beside such an icon, have tea with him and listen to what he had to say.  We will miss him and Ireland will miss him.  The stores around the country to which Senator Boyhan referred, and which Feargal Quinn went to reshape and relaunch as retail outlets, will also miss him.  Nothing we can say today will replace the vacant slot in his family but there are families which gather every Saturday or Sunday morning to have a Superquinn sausage, though maybe not quite as good as the ones he originally developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#V00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Queen Victoria is supposed to have said that whenever she met William Gladstone, she was always left with the impression that he was a very clever man but that, after a meeting with Benjamin Disraeli, she was left with the impression that she was a very clever woman.  There are no prizes for guessing which of the two Prime Ministers of Great Britain she favoured.  Feargal had a way of putting you at your ease and showing great interest in what you had to say and your ideas, regardless of whether he agreed or disagreed with them.  It was not that he had the cleverness of Disraeli to flatter people; he was genuinely interested in people.  It is perhaps the gift of the grocer, even a very successful one, to want to find the good in everybody and to seek to be on good terms with all people, but that does not do justice to the gentlemanliness and - dare I say it - the Christian spirit which I think underlay Feargal's treatment of other people.<\/p><p>Another British parliamentarian, the Anglo-French poet Hilaire Belloc, wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Of Courtesy, it is much less<br \/><br \/>Than Courage of Heart or Holiness,<br \/><br \/>Yet in my Walks it seems to me<br \/><br \/>That the Grace of God is in Courtesy.<\/blockquote> <p><font color=\"#141823\">The word &quot;courtesy&quot; has been mentioned many times, with good reason, as we remember Feargal.  Feargal was a Senator for the constituency of the National University of Ireland, as it has been the honour of Senator Higgins, Senator McDowell and me to be, among others.  I was greatly honoured and I rejoiced to get to know Feargal and to become friendly with him when I was elected in 2007.  I did not realise when I was leaving that I would miss him, or that I would miss him so much when he died, even though I had only seen him a handful of times since he had left the Houses.  It was probably something to do with the example he gave in the way he treated people.  There is another UCD connection in this, because last Sunday week John Henry Newman, the first rector of the Catholic University which was effectively the forebear of UCD, was canonised in Rome.  Apart from being a major church man, Newman was an amazing story in an Ireland in which the majority Catholic community in the 19th century was emerging from times of trial into a new confident age.  He was also a great stylist and writer in the English language.  I happened to be near Newman's church when I remembered that Newman had particular words to say about a gentleman, which are extremely apt for remembering Feargal.  I offer this with apologies to the ladies present, because the language is not as exclusive as it might be if he had written in the 21st century:<\/font><\/p><blockquote>He has his eyes on all his company; he is tender towards the bashful, gentle towards the distant, and merciful towards the absurd; he can recollect to whom he is speaking; he guards against unseasonable allusions, or topics which may irritate; he is seldom prominent in conversation, and never wearisome.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was Feargal.  He was understated and yet one was always aware that one was in his presence and enjoyed the conversation.  It was not just the fact that he and I shared certain ideas about certain values that are very important and which are temporarily unfashionable.  I very much admired his determination to stick to his point of view on things, regardless of what others thought while still holding great affection and goodwill for those people, regardless of their views and where they stood on the issues of great moment on which they disagreed.  It is not just that he was also fortunate enough to enjoy some of the good things in this world and was a hospitable and generous host - although I must admit that it is nice to know such people, or at least some of them.  It was more the way that being around Feargal was a pleasure.  He encouraged other people.  He was great encourager.  If one made an interesting point or good speech - and they do not always happen around here - he was the most likely person to say that it was well said, a very good point, or very interesting.  <\/p><p>Other people have reflected on his political achievements, which were great.  He could certainly have graced another office in this country, that is for sure.  He would have brought gifts and talents to that office which other holders have not matched, as good as the service they have given us has been.  He did not hold that office, however.  For whatever reason, it was not part of his story.  He had many other achievements in politics however, in addition to his achievements in business and elsewhere.  In the end, those things all go to dust.  It is much more about the impact we have on other people, starting with our loved ones and families, and we all know how extremely proud of his family Feargal was.  One would not be long sitting beside him during a lull or a vote before there would be some reference to something happening in the family, something a family member said, the birth of a new baby, or whatever else it might have been.  <\/p><p>In the end, it is the relationships we have with others that impact most and that are our greatest legacy.  Many knew Feargal, in whatever capacity.  Others will have eulogised him better.  Mr. Vincent O'Doherty and his family said some memorable and deserved things about him at his funeral.  In the end it is about how one treats those around one, and Feargal was a model parliamentarian in that respect.  He showed us how to make a point, how to engage, how to disagree without being disagreeable, and how to always seek to re-establish connections so the work can be done.  We are very thankful for the gift Feargal was to these Houses.  I personally am very grateful for having known him and for having had the privilege of his friendship.  I join with others in again expressing my sincere condolences to his family on their great loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#V00300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Fhine Gael, cuirim f&iacute;orfh&aacute;ilte roimh mhuintir Quinn, go h&aacute;irithe roimh a bhean ch&eacute;ile, Denise.  T&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is &eacute;isteacht le sc&eacute;alta an-deas faoi fhear uasal mac&aacute;nta.  In one of his last interviews he remarked that he had left the world a better place than when he came to it and had left more people smiling than scowling.  I commend Members of the House for their wonderful tributes to our late colleague and friend, Feargal Quinn.  I welcome the Quinn family, including the extended family, and his former secretary, Ms Anne O'Broin, to the House.  On these occasions we remember and reflect, sometimes in sadness.  Today we remember and reflect on a life well-lived and a parliamentary career well-served.  Members have mentioned his 17 Bills but, as Senator McDowell has said, what is more important is the way in which one could disagree with the former Senator profoundly - as I did on many occasions - but still have a discussion with him based on respect and mutual admiration for one another's points of view.<\/p> <p>Recognised with five honorary doctorates, he was a champion for an honours system for the country.  We should all take up such legislation.  He was the father to five wonderful children and the grandfather to 19.  He was a tremendous husband and, as we have heard today, a wonderful parliamentarian.  He was a successful businessman, an entrepreneur beyond, and a broadcaster.  Looking at his biography one sees books written, lives transformed, people employed, and people encouraged.  Whether we are Hindu, Jew, atheist, or Christian, the life Feargal Quinn lived was one of helping others and reaching out.  His guiding principle in everything he did was people-centred.  As parliamentarians and politicians, we have a duty to remember that in what we do in this House and beyond.  The people, or the customer, is what is most important.  As someone said, the customer is king.  He was a very gentle, noble man and a professional.  <\/p> <p>He was transformative in his 23 years in the House.  Senator Norris made reference to his election.  He first ran for the Seanad in 1973.  Senator Paddy Burke made reference to golf.  One of the quotes of his I always liked was that the number of votes he got was lower than his golf handicap.  I will let Members deduce from that.  We should be thankful that he came back to win a seat in 1993, from which he made an immeasurable contribution to political life, civic society and his own community.  When we remember Members we seldom see former Members come to the House.  The friendships he built with former Senators Barrett and Manning is an enduring legacy of his career in the House.  He built bridges and encouraged people.  I remember when I came out during the campaign for the marriage equality referendum he sent me a lovely note to congratulate me.  He thanked me on the corridor and said \"Well done\" and that we need leaders.  <\/p> <p>I offer his family our deepest sympathies.  D&eacute;anaimid comhbhr&oacute;n leo.

I am pleased that the Government will invest over &euro;2 billion in capital funding in our public health services between 2019 and 2021.  In the company of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I had the pleasure recently to launch the HSE capital plan, which is the first capital plan to be approved by the new board of the HSE.  In accordance with the relevant legislation, the plan has been approved by me, as Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and represents a continued sign of the investment taking place in our health service.  The plan should be viewed in the context of being the first phase of our ten-year capital investment programme, Project Ireland 2040.  We have committed under the plan to 250 projects nationally over the next three years.  The plan includes 480 new beds, 30 new primary care centres, 58 community nursing units and a significant investment in mental health and disability projects in communities.<\/p> <p>As we reform the health service in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, it is vital to continue to invest in capital infrastructure and, crucially, in community and social care settings.  The capital plan is based on an increased investment budget of &euro;642 million in 2019 for the construction and equipping of our health facilities.  This represents an increase of &euro;224 million on last year's capital provision.  While the health service has been well invested in over many years from a current spending perspective, we have fallen down, in particular during the lost decade arising from the recession, in our investment in capital infrastructure, including more hospital beds.  We had a bizarre situation in which previous Governments were reducing the number of hospital beds long before the troika came to town.  A great deal of our infrastructure is old and we need to move beyond Florence Nightingale style wards to single rooms with en suite facilities.  As such, a significant modernisation programme is required.<\/p> <p>The capital plan provides for the spending of just over &euro;2 billion on hundreds of health capital projects, with over &euro;1 billion on Government priorities, including our new children's hospital.  I am amazed at the number of people in this and the other House who speak about the new national children's hospital but have never visited the site.  I repeat what I said on the record in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I say it on a nearly weekly basis.  It is that any Member of these Houses of the Oireachtas who would like to visit the site of the national children's hospital and meet the construction people and doctors to understand the difference the project will make is welcome to do so.  It is a pity that only two members of the Joint Committee on Health have so far bothered to visit the new hospital site.  I am proud that Senator Colm Burke was one while Deputy Harty was the other.  I encourage people to do so in the context of having an informed debate.  Senator Devine, in fairness, knows the project very well as it is in her local area.  I encourage people to go out and visit the site to see the significant difference this massive project, which has been talked about since I was a child, will make to the delivery of children's healthcare in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The funding plan will also cover the national rehabilitation hospital.  We were out there recently with regard to the significant upgrading of that facility with single en suite rooms, a new hydrotherapy pool and a new gym area.  We will also invest in a new national forensic mental health facility in Portrane to replace the very out-of-date mental health hospital in Dundrum with a modern world-class facility which will open next year.  The capital plan also covers radiation oncology facilities in Cork, Galway and Dublin to continue our fight against cancer with a view to improved cancer outcomes.  We will provide &euro;265 million over the next three years to replace and refurbish residences for older people and people with disabilities.  When I talk about our infrastructure being old, there is nowhere that is more evident than in the case of some of our facilities for older people or those with disabilities or mental health difficulties.  These residences are, in effect, their homes but we are asking them to live without the space, dignity and privacy they deserve.  We will provide &euro;300 million to maintain and upgrade facilities, equipment and ambulances nationally.  Over &euro;335 million will be provided for a wide range of capital projects at individual hospitals and primary community facilities to provide modern health accommodation and equipment.<\/p> <p>The major win of the health capital plan this year is as follows.  It is easy enough to produce a health capital plan for one year but it took me a while to agree with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform a three-year plan to allow us to provide our health service with the certainty to invest knowing it will have the funding in 2020 and 2021.  That provides the service with clarity on funding levels.  As we manage and develop new capital projects, we must learn the lessons of past projects.  We will be guided by the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers in that regard.  Capital funding for our health service will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was in the previous ten years.  In real money terms, that means we will spend almost &euro;11 billion on capital in the next decade versus &euro;4 billion for the previous one.  That is a significant increase, thankfully, in funding for our health capital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>We must ensure that as we develop capital infrastructure, we align it with Sl&aacute;intecare.  We want to see more facilities in our communities and we want to see a decisive shift towards primary care.  We want to see investment in the relocation of our stand-alone maternity hospitals to have them co-located with adult hospitals.  The funding has been put in place to do that.  I am conscious that a number of colleagues will raise important regional projects today.  I see my colleague and friend, Senator Coffey, is in attendance and note the important body of work we have to do in Waterford to provide a second cath lab.  I have had some excellent meetings with Oireachtas Members from Waterford, led by Senator Coffey, over a number of months and years.  At our last meeting, we had a good update from the HSE, which is on track to lodge the relevant planning application shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#Z00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571823000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
