I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  It is a pity that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, could not be here.  Naas community college is operated by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB.  It has received planning permission on a site that has been selected for some years.  My understanding of the current situation is that the tenders have been accepted and examined and it is hopeful that the builders will be on site in November.<\/p> <p>The problem is the current situation with the school.  The first class that started in the school has reach transition year, TY.  It is more than likely that those TY students will not have an opportunity to ever enter the new school.  The school is spread over three locations.  One is Craddockstown, in temporary structures adjacent to a primary school, while the TY year is housed in what I would term condemned buildings, prefabs, at Pipers' Hill.  I understand the Department has spent &euro;60,000 refurbishing those buildings.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Defence will certainly understand the importance of physical education, PE, in the life of a student and the reason for the third location used by the school.  The local GAA club in Naas has very kindly provided facilities for the school.  The three locations are not adjacent to each other; they are located at opposite ends of Naas.<\/p> <p>There are 320 applicants for first year in Naas community college this year but the school will have space to accommodate just 120 pupils.  There are no classrooms available for those pupils coming into the school in September.  The cost to the school, which it raises from its own budget, is &euro;24,000 for shuttle buses to move the students around to the various locations.  That does not take into consideration the difficulties teachers also have in moving around those locations.  I look forward to the response and update from the Minister of State.  The builders will be on site sometime in November, but I am concerned with the current situation.  The pupils in TY now will never have access to the new building.  What are we going to do over the next year and a half of the building programme?  There are no classrooms for the children coming into the school next September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#A00500","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and providing me with the opportunity to update the House on the delivery of a new building for Naas community college.  The school opened in September 2015 in temporary accommodation at Craddockstown Road, Naas.  In the meantime, a project for a new building for the school, fit to house 1,000 pupils, was devolved for delivery to KWETB by the Department of Education and Skills through a service level agreement.  I am pleased to inform this House that the architectural planning process for the delivery of this project is nearing completion.  The design team completed the contractor pre-qualification process for the project in December 2018.  Tender documents issued in May and tenders were returned in June.  There was a robust tender competition, with all eight of the short-listed contractors bidding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The outcome of that process is that a preferred contractor to complete the project has been identified.  A letter of intent was issued last month in that regard.  A number of steps need to be taken before a letter of acceptance can be issued to the preferred contractor.  The design team is carrying out these steps, which will allow for the confirmation of the appointment of that contractor.  These steps are expected to be completed very shortly, and the project is still on target to begin construction on site next month.  It is expected, on this basis, that the school will be ready for occupation before September 2021.<\/p><p>While enrolment for the 2018-2019 school year was 379, this figure is up from 266 in 2017-2018 and 163 in the previous year.  Increases in intake in the coming years are expected along similar lines.  In that context, KWETB, supported by the Department of Education and Skills, is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the temporary accommodation arrangements being put in place for the school will be sufficient to meet its needs until the new school building is ready.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills recently met school representatives of KWETB in respect of that matter.  Approval was given at that meeting for KWETB to proceed with a revised brief for the provision of this temporary accommodation.  That is being progressed as a matter of priority.<\/p><p>It is most regrettable that this project has not yet been delivered as a result of a number of delays.  For example, as the project is being delivered on a site in an area which is earmarked for wider development, it encountered significant delays during the planning permission process.  Planning permission for the project was ultimately granted in April 2017.  Following the granting of planning permission, changes to the stage 2b submission were necessary to include a number of changes to areas from planning conditions and the public works contracts to alterations to the Department of Education and Skills room layouts.  An understanding of the impact of these changes was a requirement for the design team to carry out a significant level of work to redo drawings, layouts and schedules.  The quantity surveyor also had to revisit all the measurements and quantities relating to the bill of quantities.  There were other delays caused by issues with ESB International regarding the relocation of overhead power lines traversing the site, and a consequential delay in ensuring compliance with the requirements of the nearly zero energy building regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#A00600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I again thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  Perhaps he will pass on a couple of queries to the Minister.  I welcome everything the Minister of State said.  As stated earlier, I expect the school to be open before September 2021.  I have identified the fact that the school is operating across three sites at present.  That is key.  PE classes will be very difficult because the site in Craddockstown is not large enough to cater for the PE needs of the school.  I again thank Naas GAA for allowing its facilities to be used by the school.  As for the possibility of all other subjects and classes being held on the one site, will the Department of Education and Skills approve sufficient funding to allow KWETB to procure or rent whatever classroom facilities it needs?  My understanding at present - and it makes me nervous to say it - is that the Department of Education and Skills has decided not to grant KWETB the full number of classrooms required to take in the minimum number of 120 pupils for the year ahead and that we will still, next year and possibly the year after, have the problem that the school will be located across three sites.  Can the Minister of State give me some detail as to how this procurement will be progressed and whether it will be in place in time for the start of the school year?

He will know that I had requested the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to do so, but I appreciate the Minister of State's presence.  I hope the Minister has communicated with him on the issue of Spinraza.  The Minister of State will know that we have been fighting for Spinraza to be made available for the past two years.  We were absolutely thrilled when Spinraza was approved on 11 June.  We accepted that four to six weeks, or however long necessary, would be required to do the paperwork in order to have the drug administered.  Then, on 23 August, there was a sign-off on it.  At that point, the parents of the children who need Spinraza were told that everything would be put in place and that they could expect the drug to be administered at the end of October.<\/p> <p>The end of October is approaching and the parents have been given another update stating that, due to resource issues, together with bed shortages, the drug that has been approved and that is necessary cannot be administered.  I look at these children, and their parents look at them, and they tell me that this is almost worse than the drug not being approved.  This pertains to Mayo in particular because we have Grace O'Malley and her friends and Cillian Mearns, who have done work on this.  We need to know when the drug will be administered.  It was cruel in the first place for them to have to wait for so long for Spinraza to be approved, but there is an additional cruelty in knowing that it has been approved and is there.  The drug has been purchased, and now the HSE tells us it does not have the resources to have it administered.  We are not talking about a staffed bed for a long period.  The Minister of State will know that Spinraza can be administered to day patients, so all we need is a bed for the day, or even half the day, to get the drug administered.  That, we are told, is not available.  Over the first two months the drug is administered four times and then the dosage decreases.  We are talking about just 11 patients who are ready and suitable for this treatment.  I hope the Minister of State can give me very specific answers today as to when these children, including Grace and Cillian, will get a specific date to start on Spinraza.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#B00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue and for giving me, on behalf of the Minister for Health, the opportunity to clarify the position on the availability of Spinraza for patients with spinal muscular atrophy.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  The Minister for Health has no role in this statutory process.<\/p><p>On 11 June 2019, the HSE leadership team approved access to the drug Spinraza for children with spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, type I, II or III on an exceptional and individualised basis.  The HSE decision process for Spinraza involved a full health technology assessment followed by detailed consideration by the HSE expert groups on new drug therapies, including the technology review group for rare diseases and the HSE drugs group.  Evidence of the clinical effectiveness of this new drug therapy was also reviewed.  After a thorough review, it was decided to approve access for children with genetically confirmed SMA type I, II or III in accordance with the controlled access criteria recommended by the rare diseases technology review committee.  The actual patient assessment and approval process is the means for determining access, on an individual case-by-case basis, to this complex treatment.  The HSE has indicated that 11 children have been approved for Spinraza treatment in Temple Street Hospital since July.  Application for approval is based on clearly defined criteria and clinical guidelines being followed in each case.  All patients who have been recommended clinically have been approved to date.<\/p><p>All of the patients who have been approved for Spinraza treatment are being treated under special care, according to Children's Health Ireland, at Temple Street Hospital.  Detailed clinical guidelines have been developed for this service, which includes specific patient criteria that must be fulfilled in order for the treatment to safely commence and continue.  The actual delivery of this drug to approved patients in a safe and sustainable way requires specific and complex service arrangements to be put in place in Temple Street Hospital.  Spinraza is injected during a procedure known as lumbar puncture.  There are two categories of patient for the administration of Spinraza.  Category 1 is where the administration of Spinraza is deemed not too technically difficult.  In that case, the consultant paediatric neurologist and lead clinician need access to the day ward as administration is performed under local anaesthetic.  Each of these patients will also require a physiotherapy assessment prior to administration and recovery time in the day ward.  Category 2 cases are more complex patients who have already undergone spinal fusion surgery and insertion of spinal rods, which makes the administering of Spinraza potentially more complex.  For these patients, the delivery of Spinraza will require specialist care to include input by an anaesthetist and an interventional radiologist with associated nursing, and the availability of capacity in the paediatric intensive care unit.<\/p><p>The Senator will appreciate, therefore, that a considerable amount of service planning and assessment of patients at an individual level is required for treatment with Spinraza to be safely undertaken.  The Minister for Health has been advised by the HSE that Children's Health Ireland is engaging on an individual basis with the families involved regarding each child's treatment plan.  He has asked to be updated further as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#B00600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I do not take heart from the statement as it outlined what I already know.

The introduction of a nationwide ban on bituminous or smoky coal was promised by the Government back in 2017, but it is being held up due to threats of legal action by suppliers.  Since the introduction of the smoky coal ban in Dublin in 1990 by Mary Harney, it is estimated that a staggering 8,200 deaths have been prevented in the capital.  A number of councils around the country are taking independent action on air pollution to protect their communities and are tabling motions to ban smoky coal in their areas.  Sarah O'Connor, CEO of the Asthma Society of Ireland, stated last month:<\/p><blockquote>Air pollution is a public health concern, with potentially harmful effects on all.  Children face even higher risks, both to their health and to their development.  Those with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma are particularly vulnerable.<\/blockquote> <p>One in 13 adults and one in ten children in Ireland have asthma.  The rate of deaths from asthma, contrary to international trends, are on the rise, up from 39 deaths in 2012 to a staggering 63 deaths in 2016.

However, despite an agreement being reached between the EU and the Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, the latter has decided to pause the withdrawal Bill due to the decision of MPs not to vote in favour of the timeframe set aside for the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il favours an extension to Article 50 if it avoids a no-deal Brexit and, amid the ongoing uncertainty and political chaos in Westminster, we will continue to act responsibly, to provide certainty and stability, and to put Ireland's interest first.<\/p><p>I encourage everybody to avail of the seasonal flu vaccination.

There is very little the Irish Government can be seen to do at this stage without opening itself to the accusation of interfering in English domestic politics.  If one looks at the Theresa May deal and the Boris Johnson deal, one should not be under any illusion but that trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is going to be adversely affected by the measures proposed.  I am not relying on my own instinct in relation to that.  I have listened to BBC radio and some of their economic, industrial and business organisations are expressing concerns about that.  Whereas some in Ireland may think this is the DUP getting its just desserts, if one wants Northern Ireland to prosper, as we all in our hearts do for without prosperity there will be very little chance of reconciliation, the so-called \"compromise\" worked out is worse for Northern Ireland than the original deal the DUP opposed and brought down by its alliance with the European Research Group.  It is not as if the new arrangements for Northern Ireland are good for the North.  They are not.  The DUP must share part of the blame for that while we should recognise the truth that this is not an ideal outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#H00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach apologised to women and families affected by the operation of the cervical screening programme.

We saw yesterday also that another seriously ill woman is being dragged through the courts.  While the State must fight different claims, the Taoiseach promised that these women would not be dragged through the courts.  I ask the Government to stop immediately and for the Taoiseach to fulfil the promises he made.<\/p> <p>Dr. Scally said there was a complete failure from top to bottom in the cervical screening programme and that some women and their relatives were treated appallingly.  The Leader knows as we do that the State has failed these women and that the outsourcing of smear tests has played a role in the scandal.  There must be collective Cabinet responsibility for the decision made to outsource cervical screening in the first place.  The name of the person in charge was mentioned earlier.  What bothers me is the question of whether it could happen now.  Could there be a collective Cabinet decision again where there is medical advice?  One clinician resigned at the time because he felt so strongly and he predicted exactly what would happen.  The decision made around that table was a fatal one for these women and their families.<\/p> <p>We need to see additional funding to ensure the recommendations of the MacCraith and Scally reports are implemented.  I was disappointed that the budget did not include a ring-fenced sum prior to the apology for cervical screening.  We need to have screening repatriated.  We need to have control.  We need to reverse the bad decision that was made.  We cannot let any other women down as we let Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Vicky Phelan down.

We must fix it and fix it fast.<\/p> <p>We sometimes make the greatest mistake of thinking a public or State apology means everything is okay and the doors are closed.

The pupils in one of its classes are being spread across several classrooms.

It is not necessarily only the students in the traditional disadvantaged schools that need this programme.

That is in addition to &euro;57.6 million spent on school meals in general in a given year.  I believe that figure should be expanded.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the House to discuss how the programme could be increased incrementally every year to capture as many schools as possible.

That should be examined.  Those two interventions would have a major effect and potentially could have a great impact on education.  To revert briefly to the school meals programme, it makes for nutritionally healthy and properly developed young people, gives them a quality of life, enhances their personal and holistic development and leaves them in a position to learn.  Teachers throughout this country or any country would advise that the greatest obstacle to learning is children who come to school on an empty stomach and remain that way during the day and, in some instances, perhaps have only junk food.

He told me that based on the current level of funding required to repair footpaths in the Castleblayney-Carrickmacross municipal district, it would take 20 years to carry out the repairs.  With respect to the allocation for public lighting, based on current national allocations, it will take 24 years to repair the public lighting required in the Castleblayney-Carrickmacross area.  Another councillor in the Ballybay-Clones area, Councillor S&eacute;amus Coyle, told me that based on the current levels they would need about &euro;600,000 to carry out the works on the roads that are in bad need of repair but they will only get &euro;130,000 this year to repair the roads network in that area.

It involves the fast-track planning of developments involving more than 100 units.  We see major implications arising from this.  There are implications for the Aarhus Convention in terms of public consultation, access to environmental information, which is set down and directed by the EU, and the principle of subsidiarity.  In no democracy in Europe does an independent planning appeals board such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la act as judge and jury in its own cause.  In effect, what this legislation has done is allow developers who advocate the development of more than 100 units to go direct to An Bord Plean&aacute;la thereby bypassing their local authorities, who are the statutory planning authorities.  As a result, the citizens in those communities and the city and county councils in those areas do not have any official statutory input into the commentary around these applications, although they may have input on the side.  I am not against the development of houses.  We need to build more houses and we need higher densities but we must also have regard to existing residential amenity and communities.  As politicians, we all know that we have made legitimate representations on behalf of our communities, which is our given right.  The removal of a third-party appeal process has serious implications for public participation in decision-making and that is something over which we cannot stand.

He may consider it with some adjustment, which should be encouraged, but the reality is that I do not think it is right that we as elected politicians who support local politicians who are also elected support any system that blocks or curtails their right to engage and advocate on behalf of citizens with regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of their communities.

This is a surveillance system used in child and adolescent mental health services in the UK and Ireland.  Today, we are told that up to 4,000 children and adolescents in this country between the ages of eight to 17 may be suffering from anorexia nervosa.  It is clear from the figures that the problem is escalating.  The figures have doubled since 2006.  I have dealt with a number of families with a child suffering from this condition.  I can only describe it as one of a parent's worst nightmares because there is a great feeling of helplessness on the part of the parent as he or she looks on at a child who will not and cannot eat and is damaging not just his or her mental health but his or her physical health in the process.  Parents need assistance and support.  The escalation of the problem is reflected in the increase in referrals to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, provided by the HSE, where there has been a 40% increase in referrals since 2011.  Unfortunately, staffing and resources are clearly an issue with only 57% of posts filled compared to the figure recommended by A Vision for Change.  I know there is a particular problem with acute services.  We sometimes see children admitted to hospital in a critical state and put in paediatric wards beside other ill children.  They must be supervised.  Getting counselling or dieticians is very difficult.  Could we have a debate because this is clearly a societal problem?  We hear glib comments about meat in the climate change debate.  We must be far more responsible.  We know there is a lot of pressure on young people with regard to their self-employment that they pick up from social media.  I am not an expert in this field but I feel for the children and young people and their families, as can we all.  We need a debate on attitudes to food, recognising symptoms earlier and correcting attitudes that are leading to this terrible condition to give some hope to people that they might learn that there is a way to break through and get over this condition.

That is a worthy debate which we should consider.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a fantastic project that was held in the audiovisual room by the I Wish campaign between 9. a.m. and 10 a.m. today.  It is a unique campaign that was set up to encourage women in school to take up the STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - subjects.  It has launched a survey and is trying to make us aware of the issues for females taking up science subjects.  It is something we should debate with the Minister for Education and Skills.  He attended the presentation this morning and it was welcome that he turned up.  That 93% of teachers believe that confidence is a problem for the female population in school taking up science subjects is a major issue.  We must grapple with it and find a solution.  I hope a debate with the Minister in the Seanad would go some way towards setting out a template whereby we can increase female participation in science subjects.  It is a worthy debate.  I compliment the I Wish campaign.  It is a unique campaign to visit the Oireachtas.  It brought speakers and fourth year students from throughout the country.  Hearing their stories was inspiring.  We must move forward on this.  We must invite the Minister to the Chamber and afterwards we must put a policy in place to deliver on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#L00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We seem to have two different rules.  We are allowed to serve in the Houses of the Oireachtas when we are aged over 70 years, yet I have a colleague in Carlow who is not allowed to drive a school bus.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme and has a system whereby bus drivers who reach the age of 65 years and express a desire to continue to drive can work for a further five years if they pass the medical reviews.  However, when they reach 70 years of age, they must retire from that employment.  This is ageism and discrimination.  A great driver in my constituency of Carlow is particularly aggrieved by this rule.<\/p> <p>Will the Leader ask the Minister why this appears to be acceptable in Ireland today?  We are living longer and are certainly able to work for longer.  The absence of legislation on health checks for public service drivers should be addressed as a means of dealing with this.  We must examine ways of allowing people who want to work and are able to work to do so.  A person does not reach the rubbish heap in his or her 70th year and we should not make anybody feel that this is the case.  It is unfair to have a system in which a person is not allowed to drive a Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus when he or she reaches the age of 70 years, yet that person can be a Member of the Oireachtas at any age, which is good and welcome.

We all know there is massive potential for good and that most owners of drones are law abiding, but we are also aware of the havoc caused at Gatwick Airport last December.  There was an incident in Dublin Airport last February, and in an incident that took place in Dubai, the cost to the airport and the economy of flights delayed was $86,000 per minute of disruption.<\/p> <p>There is an urgent need to fast-track legislation and for greater enforcement and greater penalties to be imposed on those who use drones in a negative and sometimes criminal way.

The answer is not to drive down standards but to look creatively at what the State and public agencies can do to solve this problem.  Such creative thinking is long overdue.  Purely market-driven thinking is not working.  I am conscious of conversations I have had recently with housing placement officers in urban county councils and city councils.  They told me how desperate it is for people.  People in the low to medium income bracket cannot get housing as they cannot afford rents or mortgages.  We must continue to debate this and have much more adventurous thinking.<\/p> <p>The issue I wish to raise is one which Senator Murnane O'Connor touched on briefly yesterday, which is our elderly population and loneliness.  She mentioned the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, whose latest report was published recently.  I am also conscious of the good work done by Senator Swanick in this area.  It would be useful to have further debate on loneliness and how it can be addressed in our society.  We are generally a social and sociable people.  We know people need other people and thrive on human connections, but in the modern world social bonds are breaking down.  We are all experiencing this.  As Senator Swanick said previously, loneliness among older people is a hidden public health crisis.  There is a certain taboo around the subject.  We should have a debate and consider what the TILDA report tells us, which is that loneliness can be exacerbated by things such as bereavement, the loss of a partner, retirement or living alone.  It is not a surprise that these matters are more of an issue as people get older, but it is interesting to see that it is as much a problem in urban areas as it is in rural areas.  The study found that 6.5% faced serious loneliness in rural areas, but it was 10% in Dublin city and county.<\/p> <p>One can understand why that might be the case.  As the report said, there are still some of the bonds of community and church to be found in rural areas.  For those who are interested in the important positive contribution faith and faith communities can make to civic life, it is interesting to note that the study states that where people have greater involvement in their local church and the practice of faith, it can help.  Mental Health Ireland has said that this can help people maintain good mental health, cope with daily stress and keep them grounded.<\/p> <p>Today, I met a woman who is involved in one of the small Protestant churches in Dublin.  She is getting on in years yet she is taking care of the children of a single mother, who is one of what is called the new Irish and who lives in that church.  The father vanished from the scene rather early.  That is all too much of a problem in Irish life that we do not discuss much.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This person was found through this particular church network.  Of course, people do not only find help through church networks, but these are the hidden heroes who are reaching out and going beyond themselves.

They help fill a real need in people's lives by taking care of children and helping out, in order that those people can do better for themselves and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#L00700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The Senator is well into injury time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I would like the House to continue debating this.

I want to reflect on last week's visit by a cross-party delegation of Senators to my home city of Belfast.  It was a very positive and worthwhile engagement, building on a series of engagements between the Seanad, the first citizens of Belfast and, by extension, Belfast City Council.  I thank and commend Senator Joe O'Reilly in particular for his eloquent and positive words to Lord Mayor John Finucane on our behalf during that visit to Belfast City Hall.  Encouragingly, he extended an invitation to members of Belfast City Council to come back down the road to re-engage in a spirit of collaboration and positive and mutual co-operation moving forward.  It is important at this time that we embed and sustain those positive links right across the entirety of our island.  I want to reflect on the positive nature of that visit.  We also visited the Somme Heritage Centre in Newtownards, run by Carol Walker, and the new James Connolly visitor centre on the Falls Road, where the manager, S&eacute;anna Walsh, looked after us.  Both centres were very informative examples of our sometimes contested but shared past and experiences.  That is also true of the last couple of days, during which the Leas-Cathaoirleach and I both attended the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  It is important that we continue those dialogues, the process of reconciliation and the quiet and respectful conversations which are taking place despite some of the hot air and reflections elsewhere.  As an institution, the Seanad must support and participate in those crucial and important conversations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I, too, want to briefly mention the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which was attended by many Members of these Houses, including the Leas-Cathaoirleach, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and me, as well as members from Westminster, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>They had to beat a hasty retreat to Westminster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The Leas-Cathaoirleach was not too bad himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00700","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I did not have to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we did not have the pleasure of their company for the full two days due to proceedings in Westminster.

It was useful to have quiet meetings and side meetings.  I know the Leas-Cathaoirleach has been distracted by Senator Devine but BIPA will be 30 years old next year, and it has been a very useful body.  I do not know whether the Leader was ever a member of that assembly, but it is well worth the twice annual visits in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where people can have brief discussions and private talks about what is going on and find out things that people might be uncomfortable saying publicly.  There are obviously sessions in public as well.<\/p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of BusConnects with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There are two aspects to BusConnects.  The first is the highly controversial bus lanes and the removal of trees, grass verges and so on, while the second is the network redesign.  BusConnects published a second version of the network redesign yesterday and many public consultation sessions will be held in November which I am highlighting in order to let the public know about them.  The Minister might come in and explain to us how he intends to deal with the significant congestion in Dublin as well as the physical aspects of changing footpaths, roads and grass verges and the destruction and removal of trees.  Equally, there is the question of the network and service redesign, which many people will find challenging initially.  It may provide a better service.  I am not saying it will not, but there will be winners and losers, and it is up to individuals to investigate what is happening in their areas and make a submission about it.  To be fair to the National Transport Authority, NTA, it has listened and taken on board many of the observations it received, but it can do much more.  It is important that people look into this to see what is happening to their service and whether it is getting better or worse.  Half of it might get better but for the other half there might be connections or bus changes involved, which may not suit.  People should have their say, and make their contributions and submissions at the sessions which are taking place throughout November at eight different locations.  This does not just affect Dublin, but the entire Dublin Bus network, which extends out to counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  I ask the Leader to schedule a discussion with the Minister, Deputy Ross, sooner rather than later, on BusConnects, public transport provision and congestion in Dublin more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M01100","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Before calling the Leader to reply, I welcome Senator Devine's niece, Ms Anne Mongey, to the Chamber, as well as &Aacute;ine, Leah and Saoirse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M01200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the 15 Members of the House who made contributions to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Senator Swanick and others raised the issue of air pollution and the related public health concerns.  It is a huge issue with which we have to grapple, as Senator Swanick quite rightly said.  Since the implementation of the smoky coal ban in Dublin and other major urban areas, lives have been saved.  We must continue to grapple with this in order to ensure this practice ends, as the Asthma Society of Ireland has done.  The Taoiseach and I have both noted there is a potential legal challenge involved, but I commend the Senator on the work he is doing in highlighting this and advocating for better air quality on the basis of public health.  I also commend Sarah O'Connor of the Asthma Society of Ireland.  World Lung Day was held recently and we learned that 4.2 million deaths occur worldwide from air pollution every year.  It is important that we continue to promulgate and promote an alternative.<\/p> <p>Senator Swanick also referred to Brexit, as did Senator McDowell.  Much is being said, written and speculated about Brexit.  We have not yet reached the end of the Brexit process, although I hope it will come soon.  As I have said previously, and as Senator McDowell noted in his comments this morning, there is no good outcome from Brexit.  Brexit is bad, full stop.  There are no winners in Brexit.  The Government has represented the people and tried to ensure that the island of Ireland is represented.<\/p> <p>Senator Swanick and others mentioned the flu vaccination.  Members and staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to avail of the flu vaccine today, and I hope people will do so.  As part of the winter readiness campaign, people should seek an alternative to visiting GP practices, and we should all support flu vaccinations.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of the Land Development Agency, as Senator Boyhan has done previously.  As I have said in the House, the legislation in question is on the Government's priority list to be published this term.  The Land Development Agency is up and running, as Senators know, and is working on eight sites with seven more in the pipeline.  John Moran has been appointed as chairman of the interim board.  The Land Development Agency's focus in recent months has been on delivering on those eight sites.  It has already engaged in advanced preliminary feasibility work on all eight sites which have a capacity to deliver 3,000 homes.  Having completed the feasibility aspect, the professional teams now must go ahead and apply for planning permission.  The sites in Skerries in County Dublin, the former St. Kevin's Hospital by the Lee Road in Cork city, and the former Devoy Barracks in Naas can provide 250, 200 and 200 homes, respectively.  In addition, the agency is also looking at other areas around Dublin.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss this.  The Bill is one part of addressing this issue but work is continuing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As Senators McDowell, Mullen, Humphreys and others stated, we must examine different models for the delivery of houses.  That could be the Berlin model or what is being worked on and achieved in Vienna, which Senator Boyhan and I recently visited with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - Parliamentary Assembly, OSCE PA.  I had a good engagement on housing when I was there.  Whatever model we look at, however, it must be able to deliver a variety of houses.  Senator McDowell has pointed out that we are spending an inordinate amount of money on HAP and rent allowance that could be used in the acquisition and development of housing.  We should have that debate and I would be happy to facilitate it.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to CervicalCheck and the apology made by the Taoiseach yesterday on behalf of the Irish nation.  It was an important day and not just about words.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has put in place a system of building blocks for the families and the victims.  We have to ensure this type of tragedy never happens again and the Minister and the Government are committed to that.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I do not think another Senator seconded it.  To be fair, Senator Humphreys made an important point.  I will have the Minister contact the Senator, as a matter of priority, after the Order of Business because the matter of the school building programme is important.  As the Senator stated, there seems to have been a change of philosophy in how the programme operates.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has a list of emerging needs.  The point the Senator made about the Shellybanks school and emerging needs is important, however, and will affect all of our areas.  I will endeavour to have a conversation with the Senator after this session and have the Minister speak to him as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#M01300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>In light of the Leader's comments, I withdraw my amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#N00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will be dealing with the proposed amendment later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#N00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Senator O'Reilly referred to the school meals programme, which is an important initiative in our education system.  All of us recognise the importance of nutrition.  In the context of the development and well-being of young children in schools, it is critical that they are properly fed.  Some 36 schools were part of a pilot programme run by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection last year.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has flagged that by 2020 there will be 45 childcare settings in which hot meals will be made available.  Senator O'Reilly also referred to the school book scheme.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to House to debate that issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher made reference to the funding of public services.  I am sure every local authority would love to have more money.  I am happy for the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, to come to the House to highlight the amount of money that he has spent in this area, and for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to do likewise.  This important issue also relates to the area of transport.  I am happy to have that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of SHD and fast-track planning.  He raised these points yesterday in a very good meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Senator Boyhan is correct when he states that we must achieve a balance between powers, third-party appeals and fast-tracking.  The scheme is due to end this year, but it can be extended to 2021 by the Minister.  He stated in the D&aacute;il earlier this month that he has the report and that there will be changes.  The points made by the Senator are important because there is a feeling of disconnection in local communities and local authorities.  A variety of speakers appeared before the joint committee yesterday, including some from the Irish Planning Institute.  I am happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter and there is merit in the Senator's suggestion.<\/p> <p>Senators Mulherin and Lombard raised the issue of CAMHS, eating disorders and self-image.  That is an important matter about which we as a society must continue to have a conversation.  I am happy to have the Minister come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine raised the issue of the Shannon LNG project.  That matter was debated during the Order of Business in recent days.  I will not repeat what has already been said.<\/p> <p>Commencement matters are important and it is essential that all Members have an opportunity to put one forward.  It is disappointing if Ministers do not come into the House.  Some Ministers want to take debates and are only too happy to do so in person.  I will speak to the Government Chief Whip regarding this matter.  There may be diary issues involved, but it is not good enough to have no Minister present to address Members' Commencement matters and that Ministers cancel at short notice.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard referred to the important I Wish campaign being undertaken and spearheaded by Ms Gillian Keating and Ms Caroline O'Driscoll from Cork.  There was an excellent presentation this morning in the audiovisual room on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and the need for young girls and women take them up in schools.  I am happy to have that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of drivers who are more than 70 years of age.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a policy centred on drivers reaching the age of 65.  That is extended for part-time and private workers.  There is a facility for those drivers to continue beyond the age of 70, provided they have licences and are certified by their doctors.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann age limit was extended.  This might be more appropriately dealt with by means of a Commencement matter to which the Minster for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, could reply.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Mahony raised the issue of the Irish Aviation Authority and the importance of a policy on drones.  We saw what happened in respect of this issue last February.  I am happy for the Minister to come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen referred to the Irish longitudinal study on ageing and the matter of loneliness raised yesterday by Senator Murnane O'Connor.  Loneliness is the unspoken issue for many middle-aged and older people.  I would be happy to have that debate.<\/p> <p>Regarding the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I thank Senator O'Reilly for deputising for me last week in Belfast.  I regret that I was unable to be there because of a diary clash with an event where I was speaking in Cork.  It is important that links are forged in this regard and I know that Senator McDowell's group was in Belfast before the summer recess.  It is important for the Upper House to have links and build relationships, and we are very well represented by Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Marshall in the North.  I hope we can develop those links further.<\/p> <p>Turning to Senator Horkan, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly will be 30 years old next year.  Regarding BusConnects, we will have that debate in due course.  An interim report was published yesterday, so I am sure there will be much lengthy debate in the next couple of weeks.  <\/p> <p>I thank Senator Humphreys for withdrawing his amendment.  I welcome the Leas-Chathaoirleach's daughter and granddaughters to the House.  They should be very proud of their dad and grandfather because he is a magnificent person and we are very proud of him.

Before inviting Senators to contribute, I extend a very warm welcome to Feargal&rsquo;s wife, Denise, to his children, Gilliane, Eamonn and Zoe, his sister Eilagh and his extended family.  I also welcome his former staff members, Anne and Bairbre.  Also in attendance today are his former Seanad colleagues, Dr. Se&aacute;n Barrett and Dr. Maurice Manning.  On behalf of the Members of the Seanad, I express again our sincere sympathy to all our guests, and I hope that since his death in April, they have been able in their own ways to come to terms with their sad loss.<\/p> <p>Feargal Quinn was a unique individual.  He was a deeply committed and respected public servant, as well as a highly successful businessman.  He was born into a business family so his work ethic was therefore instilled in him at an early age.  In Skerries he shone shoes, waited tables and cleaned dishes in the kitchens.  No job was beneath him.  His down-to-earth approach never left him and he built a brand based on the personal touch, known for its quality and service.  He showed his business acumen from an early age and after graduating from University College Dublin, he opened his first supermarket in Dundalk at the age of 23.  This was the start of a very successful career in retail.<\/p> <p>His contribution to the Irish retail market was matched by his outstanding public service.  He was chairman of An Post throughout the 1980s and he brought his hands-on approach to that role as well.  I understand that during his first week he worked a full shift delivering post to homes in full postman uniform.  He had a deep commitment to charity.  Even in the busiest period for retail at Christmas, he was aware of the needs of others and found time to give away hampers in inner-city Dublin.  He became the driving force behind the annual Mansion House Christmas day dinner.<\/p> <p>His appointment to the Seanad in 1993 began a 23-year career in this House, where he was highly respected as an Independent Senator.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Leas-Chathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->His commitment to the Seanad was total, not least in the many Bills he tabled in the House, including the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 to protect building subcontractors, which became law after being supported by the Government of the day. <\/p><p>He did not need the Seanad.  He did not take the salary, which I understand he donated to charity.  He took his place here because of his deep commitment to Ireland and democracy.  He will, of course, be remembered for his central role in the referendum campaign to prevent the abolition of the Seanad in 2013.  As a businessman, writer, television personality, public servant and Senator, Feargal Quinn was a hugely popular figure in Irish life.<\/p><p>Personally, he was hugely likeable, pleasant, friendly and good-humoured.  He had a sense of integrity, decency and honesty that guided him throughout his life.  I might add I was impressed with his sense of style.  I always admired his very colourful ties and socks, although I was never brave enough to go down that road myself.  He was great fun.  Feargal was a Member of this House for 23 years from 1993 to 2016.  I had the privilege of serving here with him as a Member of the House.  He was an honourable gentleman and a true family man.  His family were at the centre of it all.  He could have opted for a quieter life but, instead, he took up the challenge and commitment of being a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This House was the poorer for his departure on his retirement and Ireland is the poorer for his loss.

His loss to his family is immense.  His loss to Irish democracy is also immense.  His loss to Irish society, the economy and the wider Republic in which he lived is immense.<\/p><p>I first came into touch with Feargal Quinn when he was simply a successful businessman and I was a lawyer.  Later, when I became a Minister and came to appreciate the virtues of this House, I dealt with him on a number of matters.  I found him to be courteous, patriotic and unfailingly decent in all his dealings with his colleagues and the wider general public.  He was a member of the Independent group and it is a great honour today to speak on behalf of that group in tribute to Feargal Quinn.<\/p><p>He believed in Irish democracy.  Many people who had achieved as much as he did in business would have rested on their laurels and done nothing further in their lives, but he, as the Leas-Cathaoirleach said, determined that he would devote a very considerable portion of his life from 1993 onwards to the service of Irish democracy.  As the Leas-Cathaoirleach pointed out, he did so while eschewing his salary simply because he believed in the contribution he could make, as a successful businessman, to this Chamber. <\/p><p>He was a man of very strong views, even though he was a man of immense gentility.  He was more conservative than, say, I would be, but he never allowed his conservative views on moral matters to obtrude in his dealings with others with whom he might have disagreed.  As the Leas-Cathaoirleach pointed out, he was a man who spent many hours engaged in charitable work in this city and elsewhere.<\/p><p>Most importantly, he really devoted himself to making sure that this Chamber worked effectively to do the work which the Constitution envisaged for it.  When the proposal to abolish this Chamber came into the public domain, he contacted me because he knew I was opposed to the measure and, with the late Noel Whelan, the current Minister, Deputy Zappone, and Dr. Brian Hunt, who is here today, we, in our small way, contributed to the campaign to preserve the Seanad.  Other people, including Senator Norris, did Trojan work as well.  The crucial thing was that when Senator Quinn, as he then was, went out into the streets of Irish towns and cities, he swung that campaign by simply being the man he was and reminding people of the value of this House.  Although his health was not good at that time, and he was not capable of sustained campaigning, he pretended that he was in perfect health, and he posed for photographs and the like as if he was a youngster.  He made it very clear to all those who met him - and crowds flocked to him - that he was there to sell them the message that Irish democracy was about to be damaged in a very serious way by the abolition of this House, and he appealed to them to vote to retain this House. <\/p><p>I know that the last article he wrote for <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>just a week before he died, which was published the day after his funeral, pleaded with the Government of the day to deliver on reforming this House and making sure it plays its full part.  Although those reforms may be a matter of controversy from time to time, it is undoubtedly the case that, having saved this House, as he did, we owe him the duty at least to take his posthumously published article seriously and to do something to make this House more effective as a Chamber of the Irish Parliament.<\/p><p>Former Senators Maurice Manning and Se&aacute;n Barrett are here, and I want to pay tribute to them as Members of this House who have always had its interests at heart.  Most of all, I want to finish on a point to the extended Quinn family here today, and I put on my most colourful tie for the occasion, though I draw the line at the socks.  I want to say to the Quinn family that we are deeply grateful to them for what their father, grandfather, husband and brother has done for Irish society.  Although it is hardly necessary to say it, on the occasion that I launched his recent biography at his request, it struck me that his family meant the most to him.  Of all his relations and all his achievements, his family represented his greatest love and his greatest priority.  On behalf of the Independent group, and I think I speak on behalf of everybody in this House, I thank the Quinn family most sincerely for what Feargal Quinn did for Irish democracy.  His gentle smile, his gentle nature, are always living in our hearts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#P00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I welcome Feargal Quinn's family, friends and former colleagues to the House.  I wish to pay tribute to him.  I got to know him not as long ago as Senator McDowell perhaps, but in 2011.  Obviously, I knew of him but I got to know him personally when I was first elected here.  He was extremely kind to me as a new member of the Seanad, very encouraging and always courteous.  He was a lesson to me on how we should interact with one another, as politicians in this country.  Sometimes the level of discourse does descend, but it is something that never happened with Feargal Quinn.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I learned a lot from speaking to him, but also from observing him in the Chamber.  As I mentioned to some of his family outside, he had a way of drawing people into what he had to say by using examples concerning his grandchildren and direct family.  I always found that very endearing but it was also a clever way to make sure people were listening to what he was saying.<\/p><p>Feargal Quinn was warm, witty and decent.  He also had all the other qualities Senator McDowell described.  He was a very proud resident of Howth.  I am lucky enough to live in Howth and I know how well regarded Feargal was all over the country, but especially in that part of Dublin.  Most people are extremely proud to have known and worked with him.  As Senator McDowell said, having built the Superquinn brand to what it was, he still maintained his service to the country.  That is highly admirable.<\/p><p>As has been said, Feargal served in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for 23 years.  I observed his involvement in many extremely constructive Bills.  That went on over the course of those years.  His tenacity and passion were always clearly evident.  As one can see from television programmes, he always wanted to help others in small business to achieve and to improve their businesses.  The reason he was so well regarded around the country was that people could relate to him as having worked so hard and having been so good to people.  <\/p><p>As I said, Feargal Quinn's style of communication impressed me.  He was a really lovely colleague, and I would not say that about everyone in politics, although everyone in the Chamber today is lovely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#P00300","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Senator Noone should leave the Fine Gael crowd alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#Q00200","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>It is sometimes said that, unfortunately, we often wait until people pass away to say nice things about them, but I always felt this way about Feargal Quinn.

There are not many people who have the greater good at heart in reality, but Feargal Quinn was a man who did.  He is a profound loss to this family, who no doubt miss him every day.

Today is a sad occasion for the family of Feargal Quinn and his former colleagues here in the Upper House, where he distinguished himself.  I hope, however, that it is also a moment of pride.  It is an opportunity for those of us who shared this space in our Parliament with him to pay tribute and due respect to one of our best.  The former Senator leaves behind a legacy that stretches across both business and politics and into the lives of those who knew him.  He made an immense contribution, characterised by charity, civic duty and innovation.  In Superquinn, he built up a remarkable business.  His relentless emphasis on customer service created a unique shopping experience that transformed commerce in Ireland.  For his many employees, he created a business that enabled them to live a good life with a decent job.  All through this, his personal characteristics of kindness and decency shone through in the rough and tumble of the business world.  His energy and the example he set for all of his staff became a model that other business owners admired.  He was a firm advocate of Irish enterprise at home and abroad.  We could not have hoped for a more energetic or enthusiastic supporter of our national interests.<\/p><p>From the world of business, Feargal Quinn threw himself headlong into the equally tough area of politics and, once more, distinguished himself.  He introduced 17 Bills, marking himself out as a prolific legislator who pinpointed issues.  He deftly worked with others to achieve his aims and passed a series of laws that helped to better the lot of the Irish people.  On the deeply competitive university panel, his appeal continuously shone through.  He set the standard that others on that panel strive to achieve to this day.  As Senator McDowell alluded to, when this House stood on the precipice of political oblivion in 2013, Feargal Quinn stood up to defend it.  Rather than joining in with a populist slash-and-burn approach to pillars of our shared democracy, he held firm.  He outlined, with sharp clarity of thought and his own remarkable lived model of political life, the crucial role the Upper House plays in our democracy.  Our presence here today is a result of his boundless energy and ceaseless efforts.  All those who take their seats today are challenged to live up to his tremendous example.  <\/p><p>I will pick out a few points Feargal Quinn made in his final contribution to this House on 3 February 2016.  This contribution is worth reading for anyone who has not read it in its entirety.  He said: &quot;I have been involved in a number of careers but in this one every single day from the first time I came into this House I have been fortunate enough to get a sense of achievement and satisfaction.&quot;  Later in his contribution, he said:<\/p><blockquote>Years ago, I remember being asked to explain the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; in five words or fewer.  We spoke about it a lot and came up with, &ldquo;Management is getting results through other people&rdquo;.  That is what I have learned here in this House.  It is about the ability of the Government, this and the other House to get results through other people.  I found listening and getting results on that basis has been a huge success.  It could not have taken place, however, without the enthusiasm, commitment and the dedication of so many people, both who work here and who have been elected to this House.<\/blockquote> <p>In the final sentence of his contribution he said: &quot;I certainly intend to maintain my interest in what is going on here in the years ahead.&quot;  I was thinking of a few of the stand-out moments I remember of Feargal, apart from the fact that he was the man to patent the effectiveness of socks, long before the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was even born.  Both the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senator McDowell have alluded to this, and to Feargal's beautiful ties.  I remember he once said that during his business career he had been working between 18 and 20 hours a day and eventually decided he needed to take up a hobby that would take him out of the office.  He did not want the other staff or management to know that he was taking a break, so he purchased a horse and named it &quot;Business&quot; so that when anybody inquired as to where he was, his secretary could say he was out on Business.  <\/p><p>Feargal Quinn had a major difficulty with promotions from various bodies, such as television companies, Sky News, sporting channels or whatever, offering great discounts to new customers while paying no attention to existing customers.  He could not cope with this.  It bothered him to such an extent that he used to unsubscribe from some of these services and then subscribe in the name of his wife, Denise, to avail of the incentives.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He stressed to us all the difference between best-by dates and use-by dates.  It is something on which he encouraged us all to educate ourselves and the public.  He said it would lead to far less food wastage.  He questioned the logic of changing the clock in summer and winter, something which we discussed recently.  He was partly responsible for the change to how we receive the Order Paper, which was put in a brown envelope and put in our pigeonholes every sitting day.  We can get it now on the Internet.<\/p><p>Feargal was a very decent and honourable man, dapper, as he has been described by many, and who always carried his briefcase.  When he walked in through the door, one would know by the speed he was walking at whether he was in good or bad humour, or whether the Government was going to get it.  I learned that as a former Government Chief Whip.  One is able to read the body language of people that one might be depending on for a vote.<\/p><p>It was an honour for me to serve with him from 2002 to 2016.

He never asked anyone to do anything that he would not do himself.  That was a testament to the man.  I remember his great war cry, which I think was also the title of one of his books: the customer is king.  That was Feargal Quinn all over.<\/p> <p>I sat beside him in the House for many years.  He was always gentlemanly.  Even if one was disagreeing with him, he never lost his cool.  He was always an immensely courteous man.<\/p> <p>He was deeply religious.  That is something people have not referred to yet.  He was deeply religious in a very genuine sort of way.  He was, I believe, Supreme Knight of the Knights of St. Columbanus, and he was very proud of the papal knighthood that was conferred upon him.  He used to wear the rosette in the House with great pride and distinction.  I was a guest in the Cosmos Club in Washington some years ago and I was presented with the rosette of the club.  It was a very distinguished place.  Practically all its members were Nobel prize winners in science of some kind, so I was something of a lame duck there.  Just for fun, I wore the rosette.  Feargal's eyes nearly unscrewed themselves from his face when he saw it, and he could not resist asking me what this was?  I told him it was a papal knighthood but His Holiness told me I had to be very discreet about it.  The look on Feargal's face was absolutely priceless.<\/p> <p>He was meticulous in his contributions.  I will always remember, because I sat beside him for many years, that he always had his notes typed out and double-spaced.  They presented him with the groundwork for his argument.  He introduced an enormous number of Bills as a private Member, I think more than any other Member of this House.  That was a very significant contribution.

He was an ebullient businessman, entrepreneur and innovator, but most importantly to his family he was a loving father, brother, and grandfather.<\/p><p>Feargal Quinn was an innovator in the Irish retail sector.  No one needs me to tell them that.  He brought about new levels of customer service.  Even for people like me who never met Feargal Quinn, I felt that I knew him.  We watched him and followed him and listened to what he had to say.  He will be remembered for the likes of the loyalty cards, the self-scanning, coupled with the famous high-level customer service and the stand out products.  We all know about the Superquinn pork sausages.  I think SuperValu still retains them.  He was a leader and he treated his staff like a family and valued them as much as the customer.  When Senator Wilson was talking about the customer and how Feargal Quinn appreciated existing customers, it reminded me of the insurance companies.  They could certainly learn a thing or two from Feargal Quinn in terms of customer service.  He encouraged staff to progress and to find a passion in retail as much as he did.  He really showed what can be done when one aligns passion with purpose.<\/p><p>Feargal Quinn seems to have gone out of his way to brighten everybody's day.  It was really evident.  His levels of emotional and social intelligence were there for all to see.  He clearly invested in the happiness and well-being of his staff.  I was speaking to a former staff member of Superquinn yesterday and I mentioned Feargal Quinn.  A smile came to her face and she said he was such a lovely man.  He was great to work for and always had a smile on his face.  She said she loved when he visited the store, that he was inspirational to them all, and that he valued them as employees.  She said that still to this day in any work she does, she always remembers the values he taught them in customer care.  It is more than 20 years since that person worked in the company but it shows the impact that can have on someone years later.  Is that not what we would wish or aspire to for all of us?  This is what Feargal Quinn was to many people.  He put the needs of the customer first and foremost, and he transformed the retail landscape.<\/p><p>As a Senator for 23 years he was a strong voice for the national business community and a force for change.  He was, as was mentioned earlier, passionate about Seanad reform.  I cannot recall an Irish businessman who is more fondly remembered by those who met him.  Senator McDowell referred earlier to his article in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  Senator Boyhan shared it with me earlier.  Something really stood out for me in terms of leadership, some of the global leadership we see now, and some of the people who are in positions of leadership who could learn a thing or two from Feargal Quinn.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What he said was that leadership is not about marching in step with the <i>status quo<\/i>.

I cannot imagine how much they miss him but I hope they take some solace from the legacy of care, compassion and leadership that he has left us all.

We worked together, along with Senator McDowell and others, in the campaign to save the Seanad in 2013, long before I thought I might ever become a Senator.  As previous speakers stated, he spoke with such warm and passion about the Seanad, not only what it was but also what it could become.  He was an incredibly powerful advocate for the Seanad at that time and a wonderfully gracious person.<\/p> <p>I did not have the opportunity of serving with Feargal Quinn in the Seanad.  We have heard Senators speak of him warmly, and they also speak with great warmth in between times about working and serving with him.  I was, however, placed in his office for my first few weeks in the Oireachtas.  I saw in the labelled shelves in his office a level of meticulous organisation I will never match.  One could see in how well organised his office was the attention and thought that went in to every aspect of his work, from personal communications through to his legislative work.<\/p> <p>What I know best is some of the legislation he brought forward.  It is an incredible achievement to have introduced 17 Bills, some of which, for example, his legislation on subcontractors and their rights and on health, are now well known.  It was clear that health was an area of passion for Feargal Quinn.  He did work on access to defibrillators, which were not common or understood at the time, organ donation and other issues.  We are still debating some of these issues in the House and seeking to implement adequate legislation areas that support people's health.  There was a level of care and concern in his legislation.<\/p> <p>When I was working on the area of privacy, I was struck by how current Feargal Quinn was.  Only days before he retired from the Seanad, he introduced legislation on drones and was looking at legislation on privacy.  He was always up to the minute and concerned with new and emerging issues.  I say that because that work matters.  It leaves traces and affects the debates and decisions that happen here today.<\/p> <p>I knew that part of him but when I went to his funeral I learned about many other parts of him that I did not know about.  The colour and warmth he brought to the lives of his family were clear from his colourful ties and that came across beautifully.  It was also clear how loved he was in the world of business.  I was struck by a few points that seemed to echo what I saw in him as a Senator.  His strong and gracious voice in debate, which has been recognised and spoken about by previous speakers, was clear to those who spoke to him.  I was struck that the Mandate trade union spoke about him as somebody with whom they could work with respect and that he embraced unions in his company.  That was an important tribute from those who would have been adversaries at times but who also recognised the respect he showed.<\/p> <p>People spoke about having been managed by him.  They spoke of the faith he placed in them and the potential he saw in them.  That was the potential he saw in this House.  It is why he was passionate about Seanad reform as well.  He was excited about the idea.  Even in his last speech, he said that the House could not happen without enthusiasm.  He said: \"If we are going to succeed, we have to continue with the commitment, the dedication and the enthusiasm which I have seen here during the years.\"  He wanted everyone to be enthusiastic about the Seanad and he trusted everybody to be interested in debating issues in a different way and in the Seanad bringing a different perspective.  That is echoed as well.<\/p> <p>All of those strands, all of that enthusiasm for life, business, his family and what Ireland could and should be, have carried through.  While the work of Seanad reform, which he pushed for, has not yet delivered, we will continue to campaign for that as well.<\/p> <p>It is an honour to serve on the panel which Feargal Quinn served so graciously for such a long time.  On behalf of the Civil Engagement group, I pay tribute to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#S00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I extend my deepest sympathies to the Quinn family and all of the friends of the former Senator, Feargal Quinn. When he gave his last address to the House, he used one of his seanfhocail, &eacute;ist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhfaidh t&uacute; breac or listen to the sound of the river and you will get the trout.  This reflected his philosophy in life, which was to listen and then to achieve.  He spoke of the 17 Bills he had proposed.  He succeeded in having one of the last Bills he introduced passed in his name.  We should bear in mind that he is one of only six Senators who have passed a Bill while in opposition in the history of the Seanad.  That tells us the level of his achievement.  Although we all introduce Bills, very few Opposition Members manage to get them passed.  He also pointed out that some of the Bills that he introduced were reintroduced or taken on by the Government and implemented in other forms.  He did not go on about what those were but he knew that he instigated the debate on them.  That, in itself, is a legacy.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins referred to Feargal Quinn's Bill on organ donation, which is an issue he brought to my attention and on which he was a strong advocate.  He and I managed to conspire one summer to ruin everyone's holidays, including his own, such was his enthusiasm for the Bill because we found a mechanism to debate the first legislation ever introduced here on organ donation through an obscure rule of the House which required 20 signatures, of which, of course, Feargal's was the first.  We got 19 other signatures before encountering a slight problem.  On the day we were supposed to submit the technical letter recalling the Seanad, the Clerk of the Seanad rang me to say we had not lodged the motion and we needed two signatures.  I live in County Kerry.  I would not have got up to Dublin to lodge the letter by 5 p.m. so I rang around.  No one answers the phone in August but Feargal Quinn answered and asked me where he should meet my staff.  The staff had to go out to his house with the document, which he then signed and it was submitted on time, thus ruining, unfortunately, everybody's holidays and resulting in the recall of the Seanad.  We lost the vote, by the way, on the casting vote of the Chair.  We had a major debate on organ donation that August.  The night before that debate, the Government, which was in a panic because of Feargal Quinn's signature and his knowledge of the process, appointed two organ donor co-ordinators because it wanted to say it had done something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#S00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>That is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#S00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Subsequent to the debate, 20 more staff were appointed.

I will talk about some of the personal encounters I had with him.  Before I do so, I welcome Denise and her family and all the Members in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  I also welcome the visitors and former Senators in the other Visitors Gallery.<\/p> <p>I met Feargal more than 42 years ago.  At the age of 11 I worked in a little bakery called Molloys on Mount Merrion Avenue.  Superquinn was getting going.  It had a fantastic big new store opening in Blackrock.  Inevitably, Molloys off-licence started to close and, as another year went on, Molloys bakery closed.  I cleaned and scrubbed the floor in Molloys bakery after school.  Someone suggested that the bakery was to close and that I would need to get myself an after-school job quickly.  I arrived at the new Superquinn store - as I said, more than 40 years ago - and met a lady manager there who told me I would need to speak to somebody else, namely, a manager, and I did.  I told her my story and I started a week later.  This was just an after-school job in Blackrock.<\/p> <p>Feargal used to do his tours of his shops then.  He would put on his hat if he was behind the bakery counter, the meat counter or wherever else.  He took the time to visit his stores.  We never quite knew when he would come but he came to a number of stores all over Dublin and got his hands dirty in the real business of retailing.  He loved customers and loved people.  I remember him stopping me one day, apologising and telling me he had meant to introduce himself to me the previous week when he had seen me.  I told him the story of how I got the job.  I told him Molloys was to close in two weeks' time.  He asked whether many other people would lose their jobs there.  I said \"Yes\".  He said that that was what competition did, that in the case of a big store there were other stores around it.  We know the stores in that area as Blackrock Shopping Centre today.  It is currently being renovated.  I said I would bring someone from Molloys to Superquinn.  Feargal said \"No\", that I should bring them all down and that they were entitled at least to an interview.  There was a feeling that these jobs hinged on the interview, but they did not.  I was reminded of this encounter with Feargal in looking back over his life in recent months.  How would one describe him?  He was a facilitator, a motivator and an organiser.  He cared fundamentally about people.  That was his innate skill.<\/p> <p>Many people will not be aware of the following, so I will share it with the House.  Feargal employed many people who came from the Magdalen laundries in south County Dublin.  He took a particular interest in the people who grew up in Madonna House in Stillorgan.  I think of one particular woman, whom I will call Lily.  He gave her a job in Blackrock and trained her.  She said she would not really be fit for anything more than work in the back of the store.  Feargal asked why not and told her she could come right through the ranks of Superquinn.  She was not good at reading or writing, she said, and had literally no numeracy.  Feargal encouraged her and arranged for her to go to the vocational school in Stillorgan.  She did what we would call writing and sums.  Feargal motivated and tutored her.  When he took people on, he did not let them down.  He saw them through.  I spoke to Lily recently.  She said that for years after that, Feargal Quinn always sent her a birthday card.  She did not have parents.  She did not know where she came from.  She grew up in care, she said.  She got a job, however, and spent years working for Feargal.<\/p> <p>One of the hardest decisions she had to deal with was when Feargal one day said he would like to see her up in his office, where he said he wanted her to move out of Blackrock.  She said she could not.  This was her life.  Her friends were there.  She lived in a little bedsitter down the road.  She was happy.  She asked Feargal not to move her.  He said he wanted to move her over to the shop on Sundrive Road.  This was a promotion.  He realised, however, that she had to be stretched and pushed on if she was to grow and gain in confidence.  That was Feargal.  He believed in people.  He saw the potential and capacity in them and he saw these qualities in her.  She moved over to the Sundrive Road shop and got a little flat in Kimmage, thanks to Feargal.  She said to me one day that she still had the little television table she had got in Dockrells, thanks to Feargal Quinn.  He did not go around telling people all about this.  I suggest to the House that much of the reason for his not doing so was that he had fundamental Christian principles, which we in politics do not seem to talk about very much today, although someone referred to them earlier.  Feargal was ultimately Christian and a humanitarian.  He believed in responding to people's needs in everything he did.<\/p> <p>I will touch on his very famous programme, \"Retail Therapy\", with which I was particularly impressed.  He loved that programme.  He went around the country, visiting in particular the little family stores and provincial towns.  He helped the shop owners rejig their stores, make them more relevant and boost their business.  He was passionate about provincial towns.  He loved them.  He saw the potential in the small family business that offered quality and service.  It was not always about price.  It was about quality and service.  He loved doing that programme.<\/p> <p>I wish to acknowledge his work on saving the Seanad because perhaps we have not acknowledged it enough in the past.  I will not look back on those who advocated abolition.  The Seanad is here today thanks to Feargal and a few other people.  It is important we acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>Many years after I first met Feargal, I met him in the corridors of these Houses, down in the coffee shop.  He asked me what I was doing here, and I said I was thinking about running for the Seanad.  I was a former Progressive Democrat county councillor.  We talked about the past because he remembered me.  He said he wanted to nominate me.  He nominated Michael McDowell.  He had dual nomination rights as a university Senator.  I received a call asking me to come out to Santry.  Denise may remember this because she was there at the time.  He wanted to speak to me.  I went out to Santry hospital before the election.  I went downstairs to the reception.  The woman at reception asked me who I was looking for.  I did not want to shout too loudly that I was looking for Feargal Quinn.  She rang Feargal, who said he wanted me to come up to him, and I did so.  He had his nomination there in the hospital.  He joked that he wanted to sign it before having his epidural because he might not have another opportunity.  I told him I was really honoured that, having worked for him as a boy, I was there at his request and his invitation to get his nomination.<\/p> <p>Feargal asked me to do something else.  He asked me to get four independent nominees to support me in seeking election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He was proud of independence and of the fact that one could be effective in the Houses of the Oireachtas without having to take a party whip.  He really believed in that.  He did not have to offend anyone but he was proud of his independence and the fact that he was not subject to a party whip.  I asked him if he could give me one piece of advice.  He told me to remember one thing.  One comes into politics with one's integrity and, by golly, one should go out with it.  He told me that anyone who does that will be very successful.  He told me to be independent-minded, not afraid to challenge, to speak up and to advocate, to be important and to be oneself.  We see the world from where we stand and our experiences in it.  I think I have used that expression often here.  I have no doubt that Feargal's personal experiences as a child, growing up in business and within his family, had an impact on him.  He brought this to bear because he was human, humane and a humanitarian in all he did.<\/p> <p>I was greatly honoured that he should nominate me and greatly honoured and privileged by his advice, which was to be true to oneself, work hard, advocate for people at a disadvantage and go on and do my best in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  More importantly than anything, I thank him and his extended family for giving me and hundreds of other people a chance and an opportunity.  We all need a leg up and a tap on the shoulder.  We all need to be encouraged.  We all need affirmation and a belief in ourselves and our capacity to bring good and to do good.  I learned most of that from Feargal Quinn.  I thank Denise and Feargal's family for giving us so much of Feargal's time, their family's time, their family's lifetime.  More importantly, I thank them for his service to the institutions of this State, to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to business and to people such as Lily and hundreds of others who got the start, the gentle word, the guidance and the advice and who were never forgotten by Feargal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#T00100","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I call the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Paddy Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#T00150","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I wish to say to Senator Boyhan that the former Senator, Feargal Quinn, was a very practical man.

I welcome former Senators Maurice Manning, Sean Barrett and Fiach MacConghail.  It is not often that we have expressions of sympathy to families that are also attended by former Members so it shows the high esteem in which former Senator Feargal Quinn was held not just in this House but throughout the State.  <\/p><p>Feargal Quinn brought a wealth of knowledge from the business community to this Chamber.  He did not just bring knowledge from the business end.  He brought knowledge from his experience of working in semi-State bodies, including the chairmanship of An Post.  He brought all that knowledge into this Chamber and it was of great assistance to Members of this House in making decisions.  When Feargal Quinn voted in this Chamber, he did not always vote with the Government and neither did he always vote against it.  He always voted based on what he thought was best regardless of whether the Government or his colleagues liked it or not.  He voted with his conscience and he voted for what he thought was best for the State.  <\/p><p>He is a great loss to Irish society.  He loved to tell us the stories about being in the supermarkets helping the customers to pack their trolleys and put their shopping into their cars.  That was more to do with finding out what the housekeeper wanted.  It was a great way of finding out what she wanted and how fresh the product was so he had first-hand knowledge of his business from meeting customers, getting trolleys for them and helping them to their cars.  <\/p><p>He was a very practical man who spoke in very practical terms.  It was a great honour to have served in the Chamber with him.  I was elected to the Seanad on the same day as Feargal Quinn in 1993.  He was a great advocate, as previous speakers have noted, for the retention of this House and played a leading role in that.  We can see the amount of legislation he brought through the House.  Seventeen Bills is a significant number of Bills for anybody to take through this House.  There are probably Ministers who have gone through the Houses without taking any legislation through the D&aacute;il or this House so his value to the State with regard to legislation that has been passed or brought forward is not to be underestimated.   <\/p><p>He was a great golfer and loved to play golf in Portmarnock early in the morning with his wife Denise.  He often told me that it cleared his head for the day ahead.  He sponsored the Oireachtas turkey competition every November or December leading up to Christmas.  We used to have a great night in the D&aacute;il restaurant when the Superquinn vouchers were given out.  We had many great nights with Feargal Quinn.  I, again, wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his wife Denise and his family.  May he rest in peace.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#T00200","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I express my sympathy to Denise and Feargal's family on behalf of the Labour Senators.  Listening to the array of tributes paid by other colleagues in the Seanad, I am struck by the really moving stories of the immense influence Feargal Quinn had on so many across this House and beyond, the way he encouraged and promoted people and was always so courteous and kind to people.  That really fits my own memory of Feargal.  I was honoured to serve with him in the Seanad between 2007 and the last election and was part of the group of Independent Senators with him for some time.  Although we did not always agree politically, I always got on so well with him.  He was always so kind.  Others have noted how he was always courteous and how he was a real gentleman.  He also had a lovely mischievous sense of humour as exemplified by the colourful socks and tie.  It is a pity that Senator McDowell did not emulate Senator Quinn's socks because they added a lovely touch to life and business in the Seanad Chamber.<\/p> <p>He was always extremely professional.  Others have spoken about his enormous workload and the number of Private Members' Bills he brought forward.  Key to the way he worked in the Seanad was always being co-operative, working on a cross-party basis and seeking to ensure consensus and to bring forward legislation.  <\/p> <p>He was very good at mentoring newer Senators, of whom I was one.  I remember him telling me not to mind how short the space of time I had to speak was and to always just make my point in as succinct a way as possible.  He was a master of that.  If someone asked him whether he would share time with him or her, he would always be happy to do so because he was able to get often very complex points across in a very short space of time.  I will take that advice and finish on that point.  I will just say how much we miss him in the Seanad and how much affection he was held in by all of us here and beyond.  I remember canvassing with him when we campaigned during the referendum on the retention of the Seanad.  I saw how people flocked to him in Dublin city centre because he was held in such esteem and regarded with affection by so many people.  I repeat how much we sympathise with his family to whom we offer our sympathies and how much we miss him here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#U00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I welcome the Quinn family and am thankful for the opportunity to pay tribute to Feargal Quinn.  In a situation like this, I am most envious of my colleagues for the way they can speak most eloquently here in the Chamber about Feargal Quinn.  I am really envious because I never met him.  However, I had a special interaction with him about 25 years ago.  I ask Senators to cast their minds back a few decades to the old shop in Dublin, which would have a grocery part and a post office.  I married into such a family business.  It was the time when there was a counter with about half a dozen people working behind it who would serve bread, particularly in the poor area where the shop I am thinking of was located.  It sold lots of bread, margarine and things that would fill up children in the area.  <\/p> <p>The shop evolved, particularly when my husband took over.  It became one of those &pound;5 shopping basket shops.  Supermarkets were around at that time but people started to have cars so they could travel to different supermarkets around the city.  Our business went down with each passing week.  I remember having the bright idea of writing to Feargal Quinn to ask for his advice on what we should do. I was more than surprised when I got a letter back from him.  It was an A4 handwritten letter.  He also included a copy of his book.  I have no recollection of what he wrote in that letter.  All I can remember is the pride and astonishment I felt at getting that letter from such a man.  It was pinned up on our staff notice board until it curled and became yellow.  Even though I probably did not follow any of his advice, I had to say that this highlighted the person he was.  He took time out for people like me, a nobody.  We were just one of the crowd yet he wrote to me in person.  It was such a lovely gesture that has remained with me all my life.  I will always try to make time for people like he did.  <\/p> <p>When my father died, I was hungry for stories about him so that his memory would not only stay alive for me but I would learn about aspects of him I probably never knew.

People recognise the esteem in which he is held by ordinary people.  I remember when he opened the shop in Naas and even though Dunnes Stores is there now, it is still known as the Superquinn site.

From 1995 to the present day, Feargal Quinn has been responsible for gatherings in my house on a Saturday or a Sunday when we sit down and enjoy the Superquinn sausages.  He developed a sausage that cannot be beaten, although I do not know if my cardiologist would necessarily agree with him.  The next time I thought of Feargal Quinn was during the debate to save the Seanad.  I never dreamed that I would, one day, be sitting beside the icon himself but he saved the Seanad and, for those of us who wanted to enter this House, he created an opportunity to do so.  Before I took my seat, one of my sisters remarked to me, \"Oh my God, you are going to meet Feargal Quinn and David Norris\".  They are two icons.  Feargal was a small man in stature but he was a giant in Irish society, a massive man.<\/p> <p>I would love to have the stories about Feargal Quinn which some of my colleagues have but I only knew him for a very short time.  I had the privilege of speaking on two of his Bills.  One was on the awards system for Irish citizens and the other was on drones.  I taught in information technology for 25-odd years and drone technology was really exciting to me.  One would wonder why somebody would one want to condemn it but he convinced me, in just 15 minutes, of the dangers of these devices, which can sneak around people's back gardens, look in house windows and do various other things, so I spoke in favour of his Bill.<\/p> <p>What stands out for me is the humanity of the man.  He could talk to a checkout operator or to a king - it really did not matter and he treated them all the same.  The great shame is that his wonderful books are not among the marketing textbooks in our universities, because he could teach a lot to some of the marketing authors I read.  When my first granddaughter was born, Feargal got word of it and stood up behind me in the Seanad to congratulate me, although I had nothing to do with it.  He welcomed my granddaughter to the world and we will cherish, forever, the little video clip of him doing so.  It will mean an awful lot to my granddaughter in years to come when she understands the man, the icon, who welcomed her into the world.  In the last speech he made in this House, he took a few seconds to mention me and, for that, I will be extremely grateful.  I am terribly sorry I did not get to know the man better.  I never dreamed I would sit beside such an icon, have tea with him and listen to what he had to say.  We will miss him and Ireland will miss him.  The stores around the country to which Senator Boyhan referred, and which Feargal Quinn went to reshape and relaunch as retail outlets, will also miss him.  Nothing we can say today will replace the vacant slot in his family but there are families which gather every Saturday or Sunday morning to have a Superquinn sausage, though maybe not quite as good as the ones he originally developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#V00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Queen Victoria is supposed to have said that whenever she met William Gladstone, she was always left with the impression that he was a very clever man but that, after a meeting with Benjamin Disraeli, she was left with the impression that she was a very clever woman.  There are no prizes for guessing which of the two Prime Ministers of Great Britain she favoured.  Feargal had a way of putting you at your ease and showing great interest in what you had to say and your ideas, regardless of whether he agreed or disagreed with them.  It was not that he had the cleverness of Disraeli to flatter people; he was genuinely interested in people.  It is perhaps the gift of the grocer, even a very successful one, to want to find the good in everybody and to seek to be on good terms with all people, but that does not do justice to the gentlemanliness and - dare I say it - the Christian spirit which I think underlay Feargal's treatment of other people.<\/p><p>Another British parliamentarian, the Anglo-French poet Hilaire Belloc, wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Of Courtesy, it is much less<br \/><br \/>Than Courage of Heart or Holiness,<br \/><br \/>Yet in my Walks it seems to me<br \/><br \/>That the Grace of God is in Courtesy.<\/blockquote> <p><font color=\"#141823\">The word &quot;courtesy&quot; has been mentioned many times, with good reason, as we remember Feargal.  Feargal was a Senator for the constituency of the National University of Ireland, as it has been the honour of Senator Higgins, Senator McDowell and me to be, among others.  I was greatly honoured and I rejoiced to get to know Feargal and to become friendly with him when I was elected in 2007.  I did not realise when I was leaving that I would miss him, or that I would miss him so much when he died, even though I had only seen him a handful of times since he had left the Houses.  It was probably something to do with the example he gave in the way he treated people.  There is another UCD connection in this, because last Sunday week John Henry Newman, the first rector of the Catholic University which was effectively the forebear of UCD, was canonised in Rome.  Apart from being a major church man, Newman was an amazing story in an Ireland in which the majority Catholic community in the 19th century was emerging from times of trial into a new confident age.  He was also a great stylist and writer in the English language.  I happened to be near Newman's church when I remembered that Newman had particular words to say about a gentleman, which are extremely apt for remembering Feargal.  I offer this with apologies to the ladies present, because the language is not as exclusive as it might be if he had written in the 21st century:<\/font><\/p><blockquote>He has his eyes on all his company; he is tender towards the bashful, gentle towards the distant, and merciful towards the absurd; he can recollect to whom he is speaking; he guards against unseasonable allusions, or topics which may irritate; he is seldom prominent in conversation, and never wearisome.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was Feargal.  He was understated and yet one was always aware that one was in his presence and enjoyed the conversation.  It was not just the fact that he and I shared certain ideas about certain values that are very important and which are temporarily unfashionable.  I very much admired his determination to stick to his point of view on things, regardless of what others thought while still holding great affection and goodwill for those people, regardless of their views and where they stood on the issues of great moment on which they disagreed.  It is not just that he was also fortunate enough to enjoy some of the good things in this world and was a hospitable and generous host - although I must admit that it is nice to know such people, or at least some of them.  It was more the way that being around Feargal was a pleasure.  He encouraged other people.  He was great encourager.  If one made an interesting point or good speech - and they do not always happen around here - he was the most likely person to say that it was well said, a very good point, or very interesting.  <\/p><p>Other people have reflected on his political achievements, which were great.  He could certainly have graced another office in this country, that is for sure.  He would have brought gifts and talents to that office which other holders have not matched, as good as the service they have given us has been.  He did not hold that office, however.  For whatever reason, it was not part of his story.  He had many other achievements in politics however, in addition to his achievements in business and elsewhere.  In the end, those things all go to dust.  It is much more about the impact we have on other people, starting with our loved ones and families, and we all know how extremely proud of his family Feargal was.  One would not be long sitting beside him during a lull or a vote before there would be some reference to something happening in the family, something a family member said, the birth of a new baby, or whatever else it might have been.  <\/p><p>In the end, it is the relationships we have with others that impact most and that are our greatest legacy.  Many knew Feargal, in whatever capacity.  Others will have eulogised him better.  Mr. Vincent O'Doherty and his family said some memorable and deserved things about him at his funeral.  In the end it is about how one treats those around one, and Feargal was a model parliamentarian in that respect.  He showed us how to make a point, how to engage, how to disagree without being disagreeable, and how to always seek to re-establish connections so the work can be done.  We are very thankful for the gift Feargal was to these Houses.  I personally am very grateful for having known him and for having had the privilege of his friendship.  I join with others in again expressing my sincere condolences to his family on their great loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#V00300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Fhine Gael, cuirim f&iacute;orfh&aacute;ilte roimh mhuintir Quinn, go h&aacute;irithe roimh a bhean ch&eacute;ile, Denise.  T&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is &eacute;isteacht le sc&eacute;alta an-deas faoi fhear uasal mac&aacute;nta.  In one of his last interviews he remarked that he had left the world a better place than when he came to it and had left more people smiling than scowling.  I commend Members of the House for their wonderful tributes to our late colleague and friend, Feargal Quinn.  I welcome the Quinn family, including the extended family, and his former secretary, Ms Anne O'Broin, to the House.  On these occasions we remember and reflect, sometimes in sadness.  Today we remember and reflect on a life well-lived and a parliamentary career well-served.  Members have mentioned his 17 Bills but, as Senator McDowell has said, what is more important is the way in which one could disagree with the former Senator profoundly - as I did on many occasions - but still have a discussion with him based on respect and mutual admiration for one another's points of view.<\/p> <p>Recognised with five honorary doctorates, he was a champion for an honours system for the country.  We should all take up such legislation.  He was the father to five wonderful children and the grandfather to 19.  He was a tremendous husband and, as we have heard today, a wonderful parliamentarian.  He was a successful businessman, an entrepreneur beyond, and a broadcaster.  Looking at his biography one sees books written, lives transformed, people employed, and people encouraged.  Whether we are Hindu, Jew, atheist, or Christian, the life Feargal Quinn lived was one of helping others and reaching out.  His guiding principle in everything he did was people-centred.  As parliamentarians and politicians, we have a duty to remember that in what we do in this House and beyond.  The people, or the customer, is what is most important.  As someone said, the customer is king.  He was a very gentle, noble man and a professional.  <\/p> <p>He was transformative in his 23 years in the House.  Senator Norris made reference to his election.  He first ran for the Seanad in 1973.  Senator Paddy Burke made reference to golf.  One of the quotes of his I always liked was that the number of votes he got was lower than his golf handicap.  I will let Members deduce from that.  We should be thankful that he came back to win a seat in 1993, from which he made an immeasurable contribution to political life, civic society and his own community.  When we remember Members we seldom see former Members come to the House.  The friendships he built with former Senators Barrett and Manning is an enduring legacy of his career in the House.  He built bridges and encouraged people.  I remember when I came out during the campaign for the marriage equality referendum he sent me a lovely note to congratulate me.  He thanked me on the corridor and said \"Well done\" and that we need leaders.  <\/p> <p>I offer his family our deepest sympathies.  D&eacute;anaimid comhbhr&oacute;n leo.

I am pleased that the Government will invest over &euro;2 billion in capital funding in our public health services between 2019 and 2021.  In the company of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I had the pleasure recently to launch the HSE capital plan, which is the first capital plan to be approved by the new board of the HSE.  In accordance with the relevant legislation, the plan has been approved by me, as Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and represents a continued sign of the investment taking place in our health service.  The plan should be viewed in the context of being the first phase of our ten-year capital investment programme, Project Ireland 2040.  We have committed under the plan to 250 projects nationally over the next three years.  The plan includes 480 new beds, 30 new primary care centres, 58 community nursing units and a significant investment in mental health and disability projects in communities.<\/p> <p>As we reform the health service in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, it is vital to continue to invest in capital infrastructure and, crucially, in community and social care settings.  The capital plan is based on an increased investment budget of &euro;642 million in 2019 for the construction and equipping of our health facilities.  This represents an increase of &euro;224 million on last year's capital provision.  While the health service has been well invested in over many years from a current spending perspective, we have fallen down, in particular during the lost decade arising from the recession, in our investment in capital infrastructure, including more hospital beds.  We had a bizarre situation in which previous Governments were reducing the number of hospital beds long before the troika came to town.  A great deal of our infrastructure is old and we need to move beyond Florence Nightingale style wards to single rooms with en suite facilities.  As such, a significant modernisation programme is required.<\/p> <p>The capital plan provides for the spending of just over &euro;2 billion on hundreds of health capital projects, with over &euro;1 billion on Government priorities, including our new children's hospital.  I am amazed at the number of people in this and the other House who speak about the new national children's hospital but have never visited the site.  I repeat what I said on the record in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I say it on a nearly weekly basis.  It is that any Member of these Houses of the Oireachtas who would like to visit the site of the national children's hospital and meet the construction people and doctors to understand the difference the project will make is welcome to do so.  It is a pity that only two members of the Joint Committee on Health have so far bothered to visit the new hospital site.  I am proud that Senator Colm Burke was one while Deputy Harty was the other.  I encourage people to do so in the context of having an informed debate.  Senator Devine, in fairness, knows the project very well as it is in her local area.  I encourage people to go out and visit the site to see the significant difference this massive project, which has been talked about since I was a child, will make to the delivery of children's healthcare in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The funding plan will also cover the national rehabilitation hospital.  We were out there recently with regard to the significant upgrading of that facility with single en suite rooms, a new hydrotherapy pool and a new gym area.  We will also invest in a new national forensic mental health facility in Portrane to replace the very out-of-date mental health hospital in Dundrum with a modern world-class facility which will open next year.  The capital plan also covers radiation oncology facilities in Cork, Galway and Dublin to continue our fight against cancer with a view to improved cancer outcomes.  We will provide &euro;265 million over the next three years to replace and refurbish residences for older people and people with disabilities.  When I talk about our infrastructure being old, there is nowhere that is more evident than in the case of some of our facilities for older people or those with disabilities or mental health difficulties.  These residences are, in effect, their homes but we are asking them to live without the space, dignity and privacy they deserve.  We will provide &euro;300 million to maintain and upgrade facilities, equipment and ambulances nationally.  Over &euro;335 million will be provided for a wide range of capital projects at individual hospitals and primary community facilities to provide modern health accommodation and equipment.<\/p> <p>The major win of the health capital plan this year is as follows.  It is easy enough to produce a health capital plan for one year but it took me a while to agree with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform a three-year plan to allow us to provide our health service with the certainty to invest knowing it will have the funding in 2020 and 2021.  That provides the service with clarity on funding levels.  As we manage and develop new capital projects, we must learn the lessons of past projects.  We will be guided by the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers in that regard.  Capital funding for our health service will be 165% higher for the next ten years than it was in the previous ten years.  In real money terms, that means we will spend almost &euro;11 billion on capital in the next decade versus &euro;4 billion for the previous one.  That is a significant increase, thankfully, in funding for our health capital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>We must ensure that as we develop capital infrastructure, we align it with Sl&aacute;intecare.  We want to see more facilities in our communities and we want to see a decisive shift towards primary care.  We want to see investment in the relocation of our stand-alone maternity hospitals to have them co-located with adult hospitals.  The funding has been put in place to do that.  I am conscious that a number of colleagues will raise important regional projects today.  I see my colleague and friend, Senator Coffey, is in attendance and note the important body of work we have to do in Waterford to provide a second cath lab.  I have had some excellent meetings with Oireachtas Members from Waterford, led by Senator Coffey, over a number of months and years.  At our last meeting, we had a good update from the HSE, which is on track to lodge the relevant planning application shortly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I suggest to the Senator that perhaps the week after next week's recess, we could convene a meeting of group of Waterford Oireachtas Members and myself to take stock of where the project stands.  It would be a very important development.<\/p><p>Senator Lawlor is in regular contact with me regarding the new endoscopy facility that has been long-promised for the people of Naas.  There is now funding to proceed with that.  I have asked the HSE to come back to me very quickly with a detailed timeline for the delivery of the project.  I will revert to the Senator on that as well.<\/p><p>We have many exciting projects under way for Cork too, particularly recognising the fact that Cork does not have an adequate bed base for the population of the region, as Senator Colm Burke reminds me regularly.  We need to deliver a new hospital for Cork and I hope significant progress will be made on the agreement for the site by the end of this year and  I will certainly work with the Senator in that regard.<\/p><p>I acknowledge Senator Joan Freeman's work in the mental health services area.  I am interested in her views and perhaps we could discuss them with regard to our new mental health hospital, which will mark a very significant shift from the facility in Dundrum to that in Portrane.  I am very conscious of the fact that the model of care must be about community services and provisions in the community.  We have much work to do in that regard and I am sure we will speak about that.<\/p><p>I had the pleasure of meeting Senator Swanick in Mayo at the opening of the new Mayo-Roscommon hospice in Castlebar on Friday.  Should there be any doubt, I should say that every single cent of the money to build that hospice came from fund-raising and incredible dedication in the community.  People have waited for this for 20 years or longer but the good news is we will provide current funding to run the hospice and meet its operating costs from 2020.  It is good news and it is something on which Senators worked with me.  I should not forget the projects brought to my attention by the Acting Chairman, including the new Beaumont accident and emergency department and the cystic fibrosis unit, which will make a difference. <\/p><p>Senator Devine is regularly in contact with me about the children's hospital and many other matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#Z00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>There is much other stuff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#AA00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Yes.  The Senator always raises many health issues.  She regularly brings the concerns of residents to my attention with respect to the national children's hospital.  As we discussed at the health committee meeting a couple of weeks ago, it is very important that residents are kept informed and communicated with.  Senior people from the construction company and the HSE turn up at those meetings.  There will be disruption when one lives near the site of any major project but people must be good neighbours when it comes to construction and the HSE must be good neighbours to the local community as well.  I will keep in touch with the Senator in that regard.<\/p> <p>My message to the Seanad this afternoon is that we have a significant increase in capital spending for our health service for the next ten years.  We must spend this wisely and learn lessons from what has happened in respect of some of the other major capital projects.  We must also get on and deliver.  We need a significant increase in the number of hospital beds in our community right across our country and I am pleased we now have the funding to drive on those projects.

There was a fantastic day last Friday in Castlebar with the opening of the Mayo-Roscommon hospice.  It is truly a fantastic facility, full of hope, and somebody described it as a sacred place.  It is a facility where the size of a bank balance makes no difference and the facility is there for people in the counties of Mayo, Roscommon and Galway.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement last week regarding the funding of the facility for 2020.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the proposed developments in the HSE capital plan and hopes it can be delivered on time and on budget.  However, the children's hospital debacle and delays in nursing home upgrades demonstrate that the Government's record of timely delivery on key projects is simply not good enough.  There are many genuinely important projects listed in the plan that are welcome and which will improve public health care services.  However, it is impossible to know why these projects have been selected over others.  There is no analysis of the value of the various projects, how investment is being allocated or supply and demand of healthcare services.<\/p> <p>The plan includes using public money to build private facilities at the new maternity and children's hospital.  This directly contradicts the way the Government voted in the D&aacute;il and its public utterances on the matter.  The Government has stated that this is the first phase of a ten-year capital investment programme.  Over the next three years, there is a commitment to 250 projects across the country, including 480 new beds, 30 new primary care centres, 58 community nursing units and significant investment in mental health and disability projects in the community.  The capital plan provides for the spending of just over &euro;2 billion on health capital projects from 2019 to 2021, with &euro;335 million pledged for a wide range of capital projects at individual hospitals and community facilities to provide modern health accommodation and equipment to improve service provision.<\/p> <p>We all welcome the new children's hospital but the issues surrounding its cost overrun are not going away.  The State's chief procurement officers, who failed to flag the spiralling costs of the hospital with the Government, has resigned from the hospital development board.  The resignation of Mr. Paul Quinn, who led the procurement reform programme, is one of a spate of high-profile resignations from the board this year in the wake of cost escalation.  In a recent letter, the Taoiseach confirmed to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that BAM Ireland, the construction company involved, is seeking additional money for work not included in the original scope of work.  The Taoiseach has refused to indicate how much this would cost the State, claiming that the \"individual details of these claims are commercially sensitive\".  Fianna F&aacute;il has called on the Government to come clean about new potential overruns given the burden it imposes on the taxpayer.  We need full transparency around the potential cost overruns because they need to be budgeted for.  It is taxpayers' money that could be put to so much good use in the healthcare system.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report on the construction of the new children's hospital was a shocking indictment of a badly managed project, one of the most expensive undertaken by the State.  Nevertheless, there has been no accountability.  Red flags were missed and the public spending code was not adhered to.  The project has been poorly co-ordinated and controlled, with fragmentation, poor communication and poor flow of information.  It is a far cry from April 2016, when the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Health, announced that the project would, taking account of contingencies and inflation, cost approximately &euro;650 million.<\/p> <p>New information supplied to my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, has revealed that almost a third of nursing home upgrades announced in 2016 have missed their completion date.  Once again we can see that the Government is big on promises but maybe behind the curve in the context of delivery.  These upgraded, refurbished and new facilities are urgently needed so we can comply with HIQA standards around the country.  I was personally disappointed that more investment was not attributed to the district hospital networks but I acknowledge the recent visit by a Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to Belmullet hospital in County Mayo.  I am a medical officer at the hospital.  I have spoken about this matter many times in the Seanad.  The district hospital networks play a vital role in the delivery of a modern healthcare service.  They should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era.  A failure to invest in the services provided at district and community hospital level is counterintuitive and counterproductive.<\/p> <p>These hospitals play an important role in step-down facilities, preventing admissions to acute hospitals and facilitating discharges from the acute hospital sector.  With appropriate investment in the community hospital network, we can facilitate respite care and GPs and public health nurses can admit patients to these facilities in order to prevent patients from having to go to acute hospital sectors.  Many of these hospitals have palliative care beds.  There are two at the hospital in Belmullet.  These hospitals are a vital cog in a modern healthcare system.<\/p> <p>I welcome the developments in the mental health facility at Portrane.

If the Government is interested in controlling costs, there must be a ground up policy.  We must tackle the meltdown in our healthcare system.  We must get a handle on spending and cost control to prevent the yearly ritual of announcing Supplementary Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#AA00400","speaker":"1373","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see the Minister here.  On a personal level, his enthusiasm, knowledge and belief in what the HSE can deliver are commendable.  I apologise for being a little late getting to the Chamber.  When I got here, the music from the film \"Jaws\" came into my head.  It is a case of me being Jaws, incidentally, because I seem to attack every person who is involved with mental health.<\/p> <p>The Minister could probably sing what I am about to say.  It all sounds wonderful but the big problem at present is staffing levels.  We will have 480 new beds, 38 new primary care centres and all these wonderful things, but who will work in them?  Members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association were outside Leinster House today.  They have been fighting for two years.  I told Mr. Peter Hughes that it was a waste of time standing outside because we are in a bubble in the Houses.  We are unaware of the trauma many people are going through.  The core issue in resolving the problems, particularly in the mental health services, is to look at what we have and fix that first.  That is far easier than spending millions on something that might be lying idle or God knows whether it will happen in the three years the Minister specifies.<\/p> <p>This is probably not the time, but I will raise this matter because of the Minister's courteous manner.  I am being equally courteous to him.  I have asked on several occasions if the Committee on Future of Mental Health Care can be resumed or recreated.  The Taoiseach said he would do so, but it has not happened.  A year later we are still no further.  This committee is vital and I am putting my question directly to the Minister.  I can see that he cares deeply about people with mental health issues.  We need that committee because it makes the HSE accountable, something Minister cannot do publicly.  We brought members of the HSE before the committee and asked them about their budgets.  Their answer usually was that they did not have the software to show what they spend, item by item.  We can give out stink about it publicly but the Minister cannot.  It is important to have that committee to hold the HSE accountable.  I ask the Minister to please consider what I have said.<\/p> <p>The next question probably shows my lack of knowledge about politics.  The Minister has put a policy or structure in place and says it is going to happen over the next three years.  It might be a silly question but what if the Minister is not the Minister for Health?  What will happen then?  What if Fine Gael is not returned to office?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#BB00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss the capital plan.  It is important that we continue to develop and improve our healthcare facilities.  One of my concerns relates to the negativity about our health service.  I attended a health committee meeting this morning and the way some members of the committee were speaking, including Senator Swanick's colleague, one would swear that the 135,000 people currently working in the HSE are sitting twiddling their thumbs all day, with no healthcare being provided to anybody.  I will outline the simple facts.  Each week, 63,000 people go through outpatient departments, 16,000 go through day care procedures and 23,000 go through emergency departments.  That is aside from the inpatient care that is being provided in all the hospitals across the country.  It is a clear indication of the dedication and commitment of the 135,000 people who work in the HSE.  The current negativity about healthcare is not helping them in the work they are trying to do.  We must give far more acknowledgement to the work done by the doctors, nurses, support teams, carers, cleaners and porters because the vast majority of HSE workers go way beyond the call of duty in delivering healthcare in this country 24-7 throughout the year.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It is also important to acknowledge that life expectancy has improved by seven years compared to what it was in 1990.  On average, people are now living seven years longer.<\/p> <p>There are also challenges and we must confront them.  With regard to the children's hospital, there is a cost overrun and that must be reined in to ensure that we are getting value for money, but one should look at the overall cost of this care facility.  I did a comparison.  It is worthwhile to tune into the SickKids Foundation in Canada and look at the building cost of the children's hospital there.  The total project is costing $3.7 billion, which is approximately &euro;2.6 billion.  It is interesting to watch the costs for that rising.  I am not saying we should allow costs to rise, but this is what one is dealing with in the building industry.  In Canada, the average building cost is going up by 1% per month.  It is worthwhile looking at that project to see what the people there are doing and the value for money they are getting.<\/p> <p>The issue with our children's hospital is that we have talked about it for 25 years.  The wrong site was picked for four years and there was massive delay.  We are getting on with it and it is being built.  It is important to build it for the children of this country, both this generation and the generations to come.  It is also important to look at the cost of it and do a simple comparison, and I realise that Members might criticise me for using this comparison.  Social welfare this year will cost us &euro;21.2 billion.  In real terms, the children's hospital is costing one month's social welfare.  We are building this facility to serve the next 50 years.  We should get on with the project, deliver it and ensure it is the best possible facility for the children of this country and for the difficulties families must face if they have a sick child.  Every possible mechanism should be available for the proper treatment of those children.<\/p> <p>With regard to the capital projects, I must refer to the elective hospital in Cork.  I am a little concerned that many things are going on behind closed doors.  We are not getting any information about what is happening or about consultation.  I understand there has been very little consultation with the two local authorities.  The Minister might clarify that.  Cork County Council and Cork City Council should play an important role in that from the perspective of developing infrastructure and developing access to the facility, not only for those who will be using it but also for the people who will be working there.  The population of Cork city and county has increased by 130,000 people in the last 30 years and it is continuing to increase.  For example, there will be over 10,000 extra people working immediately alongside City Hall within the next three years.  That is 10,000 people moving into new jobs.  They are not moving out of existing premises as these are new jobs that will be created.  There will be a huge and continuing increase in the population in Cork so there is a need for an elective hospital.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Even if we decide the site in the morning it will still take two years to get planning and another three years to build it.  We are now talking about five years down the road.  This is why this project needs to be prioritised.<\/p><p>On fast-tracking and the use of our hospitals, one of the big issues is when, for example, a person has gone through a medical procedure and is detained in hospital for a period of ten days or two weeks while they really only need to be there for four days but there are no appropriate step-down facilities.  Can a lot more be done in this regard?  Step-down facilities can be built faster than anything else.  Should we be looking at trying to develop or acquire step-down facilities so we can use our hospital facilities better?  If somebody needs to go through surgery, there are a number of key components that need to be in place such as the consultant, the back operating team, the operating theatre and a bed.  In some cases this needs to be an intensive care bed.  If one of those components is missing, the procedure cannot go ahead.<\/p><p>I was in Cork University Hospital recently where a man had been in the Mercy Hospital for three weeks with a heart problem and needed surgery.  The patient could not be transferred to CUH because it did not have a bed.  When he did get to CUH, the man was another week in a bed there because they could not operate due to not having an intensive care bed available.<\/p><p>When one of those components is missing, they cannot do the surgery.  This is one of the reasons we should look at developing further step-down facilities.  They are faster to develop, the cost of running them is far less and we could get better value in the use of our hospital services, which is very important.<\/p><p>With regard to the primary care centre facilities, I understand there are 127 primary care centres in the State, 57 of which have been built over the past four to five years.  Another 70 are in the planning and design stage or building stage.  How many of these will actually be finalised and up and running over the next three years?  This is not only about being built but also about making sure we have a sufficient number of staff to cover all of the additional facilities that will be brought in at the community level.  I would like to see our target for those facilities over the next three years.<\/p><p>There is another issue with the employment of staff.  I have raised this at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and believe we need to get clarification on how we are putting in place more community healthcare.  I have done the comparison with administration management.  While that area needs to be developed and supported as well, it has seen an increase of 24% but public health nursing has seen an increase of only 3.7%.  We need to have a clear plan regarding how we are going to roll out community healthcare.  Sl&aacute;intecare representatives were before the committee this morning.  I am aware that they are working on this but I believe it needs to be outlined to us as Oireachtas Members.  I am very concerned that so few public health nurses have been recruited in the past four to five years.  If nurses are out in the community, they can deal with a lot of the problems rather than people having to go into hospital for care.  We need to reduce the numbers of people who require hospital care when they can be dealt with in the community.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister that we have a lot of work to do in healthcare.  A lot of work is being done but it is also about making sure we can get value for money.<\/p><p>Will the Minister outline to us the computerisation of the whole healthcare centre system rather than using paper files?  What progress will be made on that over the next three years?  This is a huge cost saving and we need to put serious money into that area as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#BB00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar&iacute;s roimh an Aire.  I have been hunting the Minister down, as it were, but unfortunately for a while now I have not been able to bring back the bacon, so to speak, on the questions and responses I try to elicit.<\/p> <p>On the capital plan for the HSE, some UCD academics revealed just days ago the growing number of private hospital beds as public facilities dwindle.  This shift to private healthcare delivery is concerning.  Since 1980, the number of public beds has fallen from 7,000 to 6,000 and the number of public hospitals has dropped from 43 to 31.<\/p> <p>We also need to discuss issues about St. Vincent's hospital.  I am aware that many of the for-profit and not-for-profit facilities pride themselves on following the terms and conditions of the HSE, which is how they attract some of the staff.  The sector can be described as a highly private sector because the private for-profit sector accounts for half of Ireland's bed stocks.  The way in which we are going to provide this is concerning.  It is against the Sl&aacute;intecare cross-party document for the future of health that is based on need and not on ability to pay.<\/p> <p>I commend the expansion and construction of the primary care centres in our communities that we hope will take some of the burden away from the nightmare that accident and emergency departments often are, but they are to be commended.<\/p> <p>There will not be a lot more condemnation from me in the next bit of my speech but I am completely underwhelmed by the capital plan.  Many of the projects have already been announced or are under way.  Senators are only getting to speak on the plan ten months later.  It is now ten months into the year, and this is within the context of the absolute chaos of the national children's hospital project.  It is difficult.  The national children's hospital is at the end of my road.

Shame on the Senator.<\/p> <p>I would like some further clarification from the Minister on the national children's hospital.  Do we know yet what the costs will be for outfitting?  What about the required IT systems?  BAM went under the banner, which was recently taken down, of the Considerate Constructors' scheme.  Its revised costs are with the Minister, as are the revised timelines.  We need to get a clearer idea of that.  It is one of the biggest investments in health and it also feels as though an awful lot of extra money is being requested.  BAM is coming on site and saying, \"This was not agreed or that was not agreed.\"  That might well be the point, but it seems as though it is putting the hand into the public purse all the time.<\/p> <p>There is an excellent building already on the St. James's Hospital site, the Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing, MISA, building, which is situated near the Rialto Luas stop.  It cost &euro;48 million and is three or four years old.  I do not know the number of beds there.  I have visited the facility in a Seanad capacity, but I would like to work out what that cost was per square metre.  BAM also had that contract and then it got the contract for the national children's hospital.  It seems that the MISA building was much more budget friendly and more prudent in the spending.  With the children's hospital it seems to have gone off the Richter scale.<\/p> <p>There is also the big cost associated with the homes that are being destroyed by the children's hospital construction.  I know that people have had to go back to the courts.  The houses have had three years of back wall cracking, which cracks are widening daily, and the backs of their houses are subsiding and falling into the ground.  They were told and I also was told that this ground was black soil that could not be built on, and what would architects or surveyors have known 100 years ago, but they were indeed right.  Those people have had to go back to the courts - I take Senator Coffey's point - to try to get their homes fit for purpose.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It affects about 40 or 50 homes at the moment but it is expanding to that small historic estate.  That is not to mention the rest of the surrounding areas.  Residents are elderly.  Many have lived there all their lives.  People can put up with intrusion when it is necessary for an end result such as a health service fit for our children, however the way it has been done and the wait of three and a half years for home reconstruction is too much for elderly people who want to live their lives out in peace in their homes.<\/p><p>There is a worrying lack of detail in the capital plan.  It reads more like a political wish list than a roadmap to better public health services.  Some projects have vague timelines and figures attached.  The plan states that the new mental health capital programme will be developed with a focus on upgrading existing facilities, replacing an appropriate community residential and non-residential, and continued expansion.  Will this come from the overall capital budget or will it be new money?  When will it be published?  When will work commence?  The lack of detail is worrying given the state of our mental health services and the state of the mental health budget for 2020.  There are 4,000 children on CAMHS waiting lists, there are no child psychiatrists in the Wexford and Waterford area.  They resigned en masse because of the facilities.  These people were conducting assessments on young vulnerable children in corridors, store rooms and box rooms.  Will that be addressed?  <\/p><p>The plan does little to address massive overcrowding in our hospitals.  Project Ireland 2040 gave a commitment to increase bed numbers by 2,600 over ten years, a commitment of 260 beds per annum.  However the capital plan outlines delivery of 480 over three years.  It is only 160 additional beds per annum.  We know capacity is the issue.  Wards are lying empty because of problems with recruitment and retention, something that is hardly addressed in this plan.  That is also the case with mental health services.  I welcome the national forensic mental health service's move to the Portrane site.  It is about time that the old Victorian, caged prison-type of institution will become a forensic unit which hopefully will rehabilitate and help foster the well-being of those who have committed crimes.  I have visited several times.  The landscape in Portrane is quite haunting.  The site is some 50 acres, with 15 acres taken over by the forensic hospital.  What will happen to the rest?  This is public land.  It belongs to the people.  I have never received a satisfactory answer as to what will happen to the site.  When St. Brendan's in Grangegorman was closing we in the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, tried to ensure that site would be used for psychiatric services.  It is now the Grangegorman campus.  We were promised the devil and all but nothing came of it.  It returned to the ether.<\/p><p>We need an update of Project Ireland 2040, the capital tracker with the definitive detail of when exactly projects will commence and finish.  We must be certain of delivery and timeframe.     <\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to public nursing homes.  I did not catch how many beds were involved.  During the 1980s, Denmark realised the futility of building nursing homes.  I like Senator Swanick's idea of going back to smaller community-based hospitals which catered so well for local communities.  These were very much part of the community.  Someone in Dublin would be lucky if they found a nursing home bed as close to them as Kildare.  <\/p><p>Finally, I support Senator Freeman.  We have been given promises.  We would have to read between the lines and perhaps it is a bit naive that we did not.  However, we did believe that the Future of Mental Health Care was to be re-established.  It did fabulous work under Senator Freeman's guidance and gave voice to those who would not have been heard otherwise. <\/p><p><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#CC00600","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to this important debate on the capital plan, the HSE and health services.  I note his opening statement contained a commitment to continued capital investment in our capital health infrastructure.  He mentioned an increase of over 165% in the next ten years on the previous ten years.  That is a substantial commitment.  We need to see the various projects progressing.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the issues on the ground at the national children's hospital around the building, which must be listened to.  Despite the issues and the controversies around cost overruns we are all agreed that it is in the best interests of the country and its sick children that the hospital proceeds with haste.  It has been kicked about for many years until the Government and the Minister bit the bullet and moved it on.  It is critical.  It will be world-leading infrastructure.  It is a substantial site with multidisciplinary care for sick children and it will have to progress.  <\/p> <p>The Minister referred to some regional projects.  I will focus on some in the south east and Waterford.  It is important that we acknowledge progress where it is made.  There have been capital projects in my own area including the new primary care centres.  One was built and is open at St. Otteran's in Waterford city, another is built and due to open in coming weeks in Dungarvan and another on the border of Waterford and Carrick-on-Suir which serves the people in that area.  A further primary care centre is at advanced planning stage for Ferrybank on the outskirts of Waterford city and there is another in Lismore in west Waterford where expressions of interest have been sought.  This is vital infrastructure in our communities across both urban and rural areas.  I commend the Minister on advancing these projects.  I know there are challenges in getting the teams and staffing but the Minister is advancing them.  He needs to be supported in that and I acknowledge the progress in the area because the communities will benefit from enhanced primary care when these centres open.<\/p> <p>I also acknowledge the new state-of-the-art emergency department which opened at University Hospital Waterford some years ago.  That often goes under the radar.  It is a top of the range trauma centre.  The new Dunmore wing is a five storey block which has been built and handed over to the HSE.  Plans are afoot to move in wards and staff.  The Minister recently announced that a new hospice will be open there in the new year.  These are all significant advances during very difficult times and I want to acknowledge them.<\/p> <p>The big controversy in the south east is that of 24-7 cardiac care.  The Minister decided to provide funding for a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  We cannot have 24-7 care without a second cath lab.  I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Members and, indeed, Members from the south east who have worked with the Minister in delivering on this.  I welcome that the planning application is to be complete by year end.  I look forward to the construction of this critical infrastructure in the next year.  The new mortuary in University Hospital Waterford will go into construction by year end.  This has been another cause for controversy but the Department and Minister have responded and the HSE is now at a very advanced stage in tendering.  We hope that construction will start there by year end.  People mentioned acute hospitals and waiting lists.  Unless we have more community beds, waiting lists will not reduce.  There is more positive news in the pipeline with a 100-bed community nursing unit for Waterford city at St. Patrick's hospital and a 95-bed community nursing unit in Dungarvan for west Waterford is now going to design.  These projects are critical.  The roadmap is there for them to be designed and built.  All that we await is their construction.  It is good to see these projects advancing.  <\/p> <p>Finally, I raise facilities for children with both physical and intellectual challenges and disabilities.  In Waterford and the south east, children attend the Sacred Heart unit in the heart of Waterford city which was built in 1974.  It is not fit for purpose.  It urgently needs a new facility.  The good news is that there is a great charitable organisation called Touching Hearts which is very active on the ground campaigning and fundraising.

These people deserve and need help.  It will benefit both the children and their families, and will provide a whole suite of facilities for existing HSE staff who currently work in substandard facilities.  This will respond to their needs and provide an excellent facility.  Touching Hearts is standing up and is willing to deliver, but it needs support.

I am incredibly concerned about where money is being spent in the HSE.  We pay for a health service through our taxes, but it seems more and more money is being spent on the national children's hospital without fixing the problem, which is a worry.  I read yesterday that there is a &euro;455 million overspend, which the Taoiseach expects will increase.  That is huge.<\/p> <p>Hundreds of people are on trolleys, and even more are waiting to be discharged without adequate step-down supports.  I have previously raised concerns about people with mental health issues being treated in accident and emergency departments, as they have nowhere else to go.  Entire regions have zero access to life-saving medical help on evenings or weekends, which is probably the biggest issue I face.  Despite having one of the youngest populations and being one of the highest income countries in the OECD, we spend much more per person on health than the average.  We should be getting more for our money and value for money.  There is a massive recruitment crisis in the health service.  More than 2,500 additional staff are needed for the full provision of mental health services across the country.  I join with Senator Freeman and other colleagues in asking the Minister to reconvene the mental health committee.  I beg that of him.<\/p> <p>We are all alarmed by the recent damning report from the Mental Health Commission, which makes it clear that the State is guilty of long-term neglect of people in need of services.  The department of psychiatry at University Hospital Waterford had a mere 57% compliance rate this year.  There are few or no CAMHS services available in counties Carlow, Wicklow, Wexford, or Kilkenny.  The nearest place our young people can be seen is Galway.  Our young people are repeatedly being admitted to adult units in St. Luke's hospital, which is not acceptable.  A helpline number was released last week, which is welcome.  It is only a start, but I welcome it.<\/p> <p>Everywhere we turn there are massive problems in capital funding in health.  I have repeatedly submitted a Commencement Matter, which has never been selected, seeking a status report on the building for the Holy Angels Day Care Centre for children with special needs in Carlow.  I raise this again in light of the recent Tusla report highlighting the corrective measures required for the physical and material environment of the current building.  I have brought this up repeatedly in this House because we have been waiting over four decades for a building which is fit for purpose.  I was never in government and so never had a say in this, but I am raising this issue with the Minister today because things are getting more difficult.  I asked the Minister about this in person and he was gracious enough to grant funding for emergency purposes.  Only two years ago he gave &euro;150,000 for the roof of the school.  I met him during the summer and he committed to a further &euro;25,000.  The HSE is waiting on that money, so I know he will give it to the staff of the Holy Angels school.  I have to give credit where credit is due.  Holy Angels has been on the priority list-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#EE00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>It is the way she asks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#EE00300","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>It is the way one asks.

The HSE was supposed to make land available at Kelvin Grove for a new school.  I ask the Minister to check that for me as I would like to know what is happening.  It disturbs me that local councillors in Carlow have noted that this promised site, which is supposed to be earmarked for the Holy Angels school, remains on the vacant properties list.  Can the Minister check that for me?  The school cannot wait any longer due to the current condition of the building it is in.  It is not good enough.  The staff in the Holy Angels school are absolutely excellent and the conditions in which they are working are unfair.  I worry about these kinds of capital projects because these issues are huge.<\/p> <p>There is also a massive need for a scanner in St. Luke's Hospital, of which the Minister is aware.<\/p> <p>I have two other points which I will make quickly.  Today I met with the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  One of the issues they raised was that &euro;7 million was spent on private ambulances through the HSE in the last eight months.  That is a concern, as they feel they are not being listened to.  I ask the Minister to set up meetings with those organisations because they feel no one is listening to them.<\/p> <p>I have raised this next issue with the housing committee, but the HSE is also involved as it relates to a women's refuge.  There has been massive confusion in Carlow lately because Carlow County Council, Tusla and the HSE are not working together.  There is a lack of communication, on which we need to work.  More than 300 cases of domestic violence were recorded in Carlow from January 2019 to the middle of this month.  A Tusla report originally stated that we did not need a women's refuge, but we do.  The HSE seemingly said it would look into committing a site, but I am not sure about that and am open to correction.  Everyone must work together on this.  I will get Carlow County Council and Tusla together and I ask the Minister to get CHO 5, which is part of the HSE, on board in order that we can sit down and talk.  If all of us work together we can deliver a women's refuge for Carlow.  Overall, the Minister has been most gracious whenever I have gone to him.  He has always listened to me and made time for me.  The one commitment I ask of the Minister today is to come back to me about both the women's refuge and the Holy Angels school for children with disabilities.  It will not survive another year or two in its current building and is still using prefabs over 40 years on.  I ask the Minister for a commitment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#EE00600","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I too welcome the Minister.  It is great to have a debate on the capital plan.  The capital budget is &euro;11 billion over the next ten years.  It is fascinating that people are knocking that at this stage as it is a positive outcome.<\/p> <p>Having done a project myself, I have issues with the overruns for the national children's hospital, which should be more closely monitored.  I will make a few other points about the hospital.  The building's design has led to problems.  Whenever a curve is added to a building, it increases the cost by 10%.  People inside the building do not worry about whether it is curvy or straight.  The building should have been straight, but some architect will probably win an award for it.  Kildare County Council also has a fantastic looking building, for which the architects won awards, but the people of Kildare will be paying for it for the next 20 years.  We should be smart when we appoint architects.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has forgotten very quickly that when the port tunnel was completed in 2005 it was 48% over budget.  Now we see it as an amazing piece of infrastructure.  Sometimes when we look back at such projects, the criticism seems unwarranted once they are being used.  In ten years time we will say the national children's hospital is a marvellous piece of infrastructure which was badly needed.  It will be a world-class facility.<\/p> <p>I hate negative terms.  People say we have a third-world health service here, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Has anyone here ever visited or worked in a hospital or facility in an African country?  Some 20 years ago I brought a young child to a facility in which I was working, where the cicatrin powder which had been donated was four years out of date.  Do not talk to me about such things.  People are comparing how much we spend here and the problems we have, but we only have to look to the North of Ireland or across the water to the UK, where the problems in the NHS are not too dissimilar to the problems we have here.  We are putting ourselves on a pedestal to be knocked down.  We should look elsewhere before we start criticising.<\/p> <p>The Minister previously mentioned Naas hospital and sent me a follow-up on it.  It is a huge part of the capital plan.  I met with the nurses there and confidence is required within the staff.  Even seeing diggers on the site would give them a boost.  The hospital has planning permission but I am worried it will run out.  It is hugely important that the hospital has an endoscopic unit, but a number of day wards are also being built onto it.  I hope we can start on that as soon as possible as it has been on the agenda for a good while.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Anthony Lawlor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Recently, I attended the opening of an Affidea ExpressCare clinic in a primary care centre.  As Senator Coffey said, these primary care centres are a positive development.  The ExpressCare clinic would love to be linked with Naas General Hospital.  These clinics cater for many of the people who would normally attend accident and emergency units but do not need emergency treatment.  In the old days, a general practitioner would stitch cuts and wounds but nowadays GPs will not do that work and send people to hospital, thus taking up space in accident and emergency wards.  Clinics would like a service level agreement under which people assessed in triage in an emergency unit and deemed not to be a serious case would be directed to them.  This would avoid people having to wait between six and eight hours in accident and emergency.<\/p><p>I very much welcome the extra 1 million home help hours, which will free up hospital beds. <\/p><p>The Little Way cancer support service in Clane is very close to my heart.  As the Minister will know from his visit to the centre, it provides therapy to people who have been diagnosed with cancer.  The service has sought funding.

It would be great if he could do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#EE00700","speaker":"1438","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Health to the House.  Without doubt, he has the hardest job in government, although overseeing the housing portfolio is another hard job.  We all know that the Government, politicians and the political system will be judged on how they deliver on health in the short term.  I say short-term because we do not have much time.  At best, we may have months.  People are impatient for improvements.  In many cases, they are impatient due to their personal experiences of the health service.  If a family member or loved one is sick or waiting, we share his or her concern.  We are talking about somebody's son, daughter, mother, father or grandfather.  We become frustrated when we see family members or people who are close to us having to wait or suffering.  A change in Government will not change that.  The solution is planning and creating a solid foundation for the future.  This is a slow process, which will have its disappointments and setbacks but also gains.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that the Minister has a very hard job to do.  Sometimes we do not give credit where it is due but many positive things have happened.  I thank the Minister for getting the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, project back on track.  Under the Fine Gael-Labour Party regime and different Governments, a state-of-the-art NRH facility was promised.  The project suffered setbacks and was suspended for financial reasons so morale was low.  People waited years to access rehabilitation services, which meant they were stuck in acute hospital beds when they should have been getting rehabilitation treatment.  I am glad the project is now back on track.  I hope there will be no further setbacks.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister, through his contacts with the board of the hospital and the HSE, to ensure there is greater focus on this project.  Half the problem is that good stories are not getting into the public domain.  People are still saying they may not get budgets or funding will be cut.  There are three phases in the roll-out of the NRH project.  It is important that we use the health services and the boards of these organisations, hospitals and healthcare services to share good news.  It is a good news story that the NRH is back on track.  I thank the Minister for overseeing the project.  The Taoiseach and the Minister attended the ceremony to commemorate the turning of the foundation stone to mark the second phase.  As the Minister may not have the information to hand maybe in the next week or two he could drop me, or anyone else for that matter, a line on the current status of the national rehabilitation hospital project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#FF00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>He should do it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#FF00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the additional home help hours.  We need more home help hours because people want to remain in their own homes, if they can, and be supported.  We know that when people go into hospital care for a prolonged period, particularly older people, they lose confidence and find it hard to return home.  They do not want to return to a home that has been empty for some months.  They lose their daily contacts and routine and feel afraid.  We must provide proper support to people so they can remain in their communities and I do not mean just a few hours.  I mean comprehensive hours that support a person's specific medical needs while he or she remains at home.<\/p> <p>The final issue I raise is not directly related to health.  I am acutely aware of the enormous landbank and assets of the HSE and other State health services that lie idle up and down this country.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why there is no comprehensive inventory of these lands.  If lands are surplus to requirement, they should be sold and ring-fenced for health services.  We have institutional hospital lands that are worth billions of euro.  The Land Development Agency has a role to play  in all of this and there is a general view on how we can deal with the issue.  We must also consider the potential to use the moneys outstanding from the religious orders under the national redress scheme.  Many of these order were involved in the provision of health services.  Can they transfer lands or assets to support health?  We must focus on identifying the landbanks owned by the health services in order that they can be disposed of, where not required, specifically with a view to ring-fencing the income for reinvestment in essential health services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#FF00400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and commend him on his work.  Senator Boyhan is right that the Minister has the most difficult job in government.  I can testify to that as I chaired the Joint Committee on Health and Children for nearly five years.<\/p> <p>Something in the Department of Health always causes me to worry.  To be fair to the Minister, given that the health budget stands at &euro;17 billion, there is something rotten in the state of Denmark.  It is time the vested interests in the health sector were called out.  Those who purport to advocate for them should make an honest observation about their role and what they are doing.  Senator Boyhan is right that healthcare is about patients, those who needs treatment or to be seen to.  There is a paralysis in the health service that has been caused by vested interests.  There is &euro;17 billion for health expenditure and &euro;11 billion in capital investment.  Can somebody explain to me why we have people on trolleys?  The reason is vested interests and let us start calling them out.  <\/p> <p>We have had more reports on the reform of the health service than we have had Ministers for Health.  To be fair to the current Minister, the Sl&aacute;intecare report is a good one.  The roadmap he has put forward for new regional health boards is a good one.  I could list a heap of projects in Cork that are being funded or need to be funded.  I welcome the new second hospital because the development will be transformative wherever it is located.   My only request to the Minister is that we get this done.  Let us stop the political gamesmanship in the HSE and the Department of Health and let us get this done.<\/p> <p>To be fair to the Minister, he has driven many projects in Cork.  Senator Murnane O'Connor made the very good point that the Minister gets the political blame for what goes wrong.  Apportioning blame to him is unfair in many cases because money is not going from A to B to C within the HSE circle.  It is about time we called all of this out.  We are held to account politically.  To be fair to Senator Swanick, who is a GP, he made a very impressive contribution in which he spoke about primary care and its importance.  The HSE's capital plan provides investment in community hospitals that will be of immense benefit and will help to achieve what we all want, namely, to keep people at home and out of acute general hospitals, as bed blockers, where they have no place.  Healthcare is about people and patients.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not about the vested interests.  I could have come in here and delivered the speech I prepared, welcomed projects in Cork such as the primary care centre for Douglas and called for particular measures, which are all very important.  However, the fundamental problem with the health service is that it has been paralysed by vested interests with the consequence that delivery to patients in many areas is being affected, and that is a disgrace.  The Minister has made himself accountable to the Seanad, the Lower House and the committees.  The children's hospital will be his legacy because it will be built on his watch after 30 years of monumental failure and a lack of delivery on the vision of a children's hospital.  When I was in Taiwan, I visited a children's hospital.  I was envious that it had such a facility.  The Minister will deliver the children's hospital.<\/p><p>I will make a very simplistic point on an issue referred to by Senator Lawlor.  Some Senators may watch the \"Room to Improve\" television programme presented by Dermot Bannon which is broadcast on Sunday evenings.  None of his projects comes in on budget.  I had a job in my house priced over the summer.  The price started at &euro;30,000 - I was not building the Taj Mahal - and ended up at &euro;50,000.  I told the builder to get lost.  Good luck to him.  The price to knock a wall, put up a few beams and create a bit of light started at &euro;30,000 and ended at &euro;50,000.  Let us get honest about this.  Do we want to have a children's hospital?  Do we want to come in here every day of the week complaining about the lack of a children's hospital?  Let us get it done.  Let us deliver it.  The capital plan includes this investment.  Let us do it for the patients of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#FF00500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#GG00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for this important debate.  I concur with much of what Senator Buttimer had to say.  I was going to briefly address certain issues he raised but I will instead speak about issues affecting my constituency.  The Minister in his introduction referred to the improvements that will be made to Beaumont Hospital, particularly its cystic fibrosis unit.  For patients suffering with cystic fibrosis it can be fatal not to have 24-hour access to a unit.  As all present are aware, it is a very difficult disease to live with.  For that part of north Dublin and beyond, the commitment to a cystic fibrosis unit is of crucial importance and much appreciated.  I would like to see it tangibly delivered.  I would be interested in any feedback the Minister may have on how the planning process is going and when the sod is likely to be turned on the new unit.<\/p> <p>The new emergency department provided for in the capital programme is badly needed for the benefit of adults and children throughout Dublin Bay North, which I represent, and beyond.  The upgrade of the ICU and the radiation oncology project are also very important.  These are all included in the capital plan.  On delivery, I will steal the words of Senator Buttimer, or perhaps those of Boris Johnson: let us get it done.  Let these projects become a reality in Beaumont.  I am unsure whether the Minister can provide a timescale for delivery today, but I am very interested to know when the sod will be turned on the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#GG00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their very informative contributions and the questions they posed.  I thank Senator Swanick for his comments.  I agree with him on the importance of the district hospital and community hospital networks.  I see a role for community and smaller hospitals in alleviating the pressure on larger hospitals.  That is not about putting an emergency department into every hospital; to do so would not be appropriate, safe or needed.  Rather, it is about trying to transfer some work from busy acute hospitals to smaller hospitals.  We are seeing good examples of this being done.  Within the RCSI Hospitals Group, of which Beaumont Hospital is a member, more and more endoscopies are being done in Cavan hospital using the hospital network and trying to keep Beaumont for very serious and major acute traumas.  There is an effort to use Drogheda, Cavan and Monaghan hospitals.  Working as a network of hospitals is the way forward.  There is a role for every hospital and there is definitely spare capacity in some of our smaller hospitals, while we know some of our larger hospitals have queues out the door.  I agree with Senator Swanick in that regard.<\/p> <p>I disagree with very few, if any, of the remarks made by Senator Freeman.  It is above my pay grade to restore the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, but I believe that should be done.  The committee had a very useful role to play and I welcomed its role in terms of governing in the sun, as it were, and shining a light on what goes on.  When the Oireachtas decides to allocate &euro;1 billion to mental health services, that is the headline figure and the big announcement.  However, the committee did excellent work exploring what happens when that money goes out into the system.  It is important from a public accountability point of view and its reports were insightful.  I will discuss the matter with the Taoiseach.  The decision is above my pay grade, but I believe the committee should be re-established and I will communicate my views in that regard to the Taoiseach.  <\/p> <p>Senator Freeman made a valid point on the issue of staffing, which was also raised by several other Senators.  One area of mental health in which we have made good progress is the introduction of the new assistant psychologist grade.  I know that not from a briefing note but, rather, from my travel around the country.  I was in County Mayo on Friday and met some assistant psychologists.  I have been in several parts of the country where I met assistant psychologists at work.  They seem to be freeing up CAMHS slots for more acute cases.  The grade of assistant psychologist is newly created.  It is not an alternative to psychologists, but it is making sure we do not funnel everybody through what can often be a very narrow tube.  Progress has been made in that regard.  Funding was made available in the budget for 1,000 additional front-line community health service staff by 31 December 2020.  The challenge for us all, and on which I am happy to work with the Oireachtas and, perhaps, Senator Freeman's committee if it is re-established, is how we map that out.  Where do we need those 1,000 staff?  How many of them are psychiatrists or psychologists and how many are public health nurses or therapists?  I acknowledge that there is a pay parity issue with some consultants.  I have started talks with the Irish Medical Organisation and written to the Irish Hospital Consultants Organisation.  I accept there is a pay issue which arises in the context of global recruitment.  I hope that Senator Freeman's committee can get back up and running and recommence shining a light on these matters.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for his contribution and his comments regarding the constant negativity about the health service and the impact that may have on people working in it.  It seems that it has been decided that we should only measure health on one or two metrics.  I am not saying they are unimportant metrics - of course, access and overcrowding are very important.  However, another important metric is how long the average person in Ireland lives.  Our life expectancy is now higher than the average European life expectancy.  A man or woman in Ireland will live longer than the average European citizen.  A baby girl born in Holles Street Hospital today has a 50% chance of living to be 100.  A person has a better chance of surviving cancer, a stroke or heart disease in Ireland with each passing year.  That did not happen by accident.  It came about thanks to a health service that is making improvements and progress as a result of significant investment over many years and the lifetimes of successive Governments.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Burke on the children's hospital.  The message I hear from parents across the country is that we should get on with it and build the bloody thing.  How many Ministers for Health have promised to build it but not done so?  How many debates have there been over an appropriate site?  How much money was wasted on the Mater site without a hospital being built?  A total of &euro;40 million was wasted, in case anyone is interested.  The children's hospital is now open.  It has started treating children in Connolly Hospital.  The section at Tallaght Hospital will open next year and the building at St. James's Hospital will be finished towards the end of 2022 with an opening in 2023.  I do not intend to be in any way flippant about the very serious lessons highlighted by the PwC report, but similar issues arose with the Dublin Port tunnel and terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  My party criticised such overspends.  Whoever is in Opposition tends to throw rocks at the Government.  The easiest thing for a Minister is to do nothing.  We will not regret the construction of the children's hospital.  No one knows who will be Minister for Health in 2023.  There may be an extension of the confidence and supply agreement.

On that day I will quietly chuckle, knowing that we did the right thing by the children of Ireland.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Colm Burke's comments on the elective hospital in Cork.  I will keep in touch with him about the collaboration between the local authorities in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine made a point about private hospital beds.  I want to tie that in with a point Senator Buttimer made about vested interests.  Everybody in this House and the other House and everybody everywhere says they are in favour of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We will have to get real soon and stop being in favour of only the nice and fluffy stuff in Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are some real hard decisions we are going to make.<\/p> <p>It is wrong if an elderly person in an emergency department on a trolley cannot get a bed while upstairs in the hospital a consultant is being paid a private income for using our public beds, public salaries and public electricity.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Murphy in the emergency department cannot access a bed because she cannot afford private health insurance.  We will stop that.  We will decouple private practice in public hospitals.  Consultants can continue to do their private practice in a private hospital.  We will need to pay our consultants more and have more resources..  This is not easy to do.  The de Buitl&eacute;ir report shows us how to do it.  I was fascinated and a little alarmed watching the proceedings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health today and noting that not every member of that committee and not every spokesperson on health would say, as I will say here, that it is wrong that private practice is taking place in public hospitals.  We would not tolerate that in our education system.  Donogh O&rsquo;Malley , a reforming Minister for Education, called it out with respect to secondary education and said it was not right that a person could not access secondary education if he or she could not afford it.  We now need to say it is not right that private practice is going on unabated in our public hospitals.  We need to show leadership in that regard.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Devine for her comments about the primary care centres.  The challenge, as she rightly put it to me, is that we have to make them busier.  That will be some of the work of the Sl&aacute;intecare and 1,000 extra staff that will be recruited.  We are ten months into the year as we are talking about the capital plan, but I would rebut that by pointing out we are not just talking about 2019 capital plan.  We are talking about a three-year horizon in that regard.  The Senator will not be surprised that I disagree with her comment that it is a vague capital plan.  There are 250 projects outlined in it.  People want to keep talking about one project, the national children&rsquo;s hospital. There are 249 other projects in it spread throughout the country.  Just like the education capital plan or anything else, it is a list of all that we intend to do over the next three years.<\/p> <p>I am conscious of my time but I want to respond to some of the points colleagues made.  Moving on to the comments of Senator Murnane O'Connor, my neighbour, who I think keeps saying she is my neighbour because she is getting a bit of my constituency back into her constituency and she must want to get my votes in Rathvilly and Hacketstown, but so too does my colleague, Deputy Deering, I acknowledge the fact that the Senator manages to find me no matter where I go in Ireland and to advocate on behalf of her constituents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#HH00100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I will hunt the Minister down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#HH00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I met her last when I was on a family day out at the Tinahely Show.  She was there with her troops in hand to lobby me and advocate on behalf of her constituents.  I thank her for the effective way she does that.  I will follow up seriously on the issues she raised related to the Holy Angels centre.  I know it is an important issue for her and she has a sincere interest in it.  I will also be happy to work with her and colleagues on the women&rsquo;s refuge for Carlow.  I ask her to keep in touch with me on these matters.<\/p> <p>I am working my way through my notes.  I thank Senator Coffey for his comments on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am delighted we are making so much progress on delivering health infrastructure for Waterford, be it the primary care centres either delivered or planned for Waterford city, Dungarvan, Carrick-on-Suir, Ferrybank or Lismore, or the hospice in Waterford that will open in 2020, in respect of which the Senator and I met the HSE and provided surety of funding so that it can get on with recruiting.<\/p> <p>I know the issue of 24-7 cardiac care is a very sensitive and serious one in Waterford and the south east.  I get that.  A national review of those services is under way and we will led by that.  The Senator is right in saying that 24-7 cardiac care cannot be provided in the area without having a second cath lab.  He and I took the decision to go ahead and provide that infrastructure.  I hope the planning application for it will go in quickly.  We have had the mobile cath lab there in the past to try to make progress.  The Senator and I will meet the HSE on this again in about two weeks to check progress.<\/p> <p>The new emergency department in University Hospital Waterford is another example of investment by the Government.  The Dunmore wing will not just see additional space but a better level of care in terms of single rooms for patients in the Waterford region.  I thank the Senator for his advocacy on behalf of people in Waterford and the south east and we will continue to work together to try to progress a number of those issues.<\/p> <p>I thank my colleague Senator Lawlor for his work regarding Naas hospital.  I agree with him on the endoscopy unit.  With respect to the express care clinic and any partnerships that can happen, I have no role in service level agreements and the likes but I like the idea of people partnering and collaborating.  The extra home care hours will make a real difference.  We have worked together on that issue.  With the provision of one million extra home care hours in 2020, we will start to see reductions in the length of time people have to wait.  I was delighted to visit the Little Way Cancer Support Centre in Clane with the Senator and we can see what funding the HSE can provide as part of its 2020 service plan.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his kind comments.  Being the Minister for Health is a difficult job but every day we get notes and letters from people around the country who talk about the good experience they had in the health service, so there is good and bad in that respect.  We need to keep on working to fix the bad but recognising that not everything is bad.  I thank the Senator for his leadership on the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  I was delighted to be out there with the Taoiseach recently to see phase 1 almost completed.  We want to push on with phase 2.  We will keep in touch in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer is right that if we want to fix health, we need a long-term reform plan.  We have worked very hard in a minority Government with parties across the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to see if we can agree a plan.  We have never done this before.  We now have a plan on which we have all agreed, even if the Minister or the Government changes, God forbid.  That has provided certainty to people working in the health service.  It is not my plan to be replaced by some shiny plan by a new Minister.  It is one plan called Sl&aacute;intecare that we have all said we will deliver.  That really will make a difference.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge to Senator Noone that major progress that has been made in Beaumont Hospital in terms of trolley numbers.  We all remember it used to pose difficulties in terms of trolley numbers.  It still has its pressures but we have seen major progress in terms of access.  I thank the dedicated staff there.  They need a new emergency department.  We need the cystic fibrosis unit there.  We are delivering for cystic fibrosis communities, whether through new medication like Orkambi, the new model of care we launched very recently, or these new facilities.  I will keep the Senator updated on the timeline for that and for the ICU radiation oncology centre.<\/p> <p>I note a number of Members from the mid-west are present.  Senator Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell is rightly constantly on my case regarding the need to support the Limerick hospital.  I want to see the installation of a second MRI scanner there.  I have met officials from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the HSE and my Department to see how best to make that happen.  We have provided additional funding for transitional care, fair deal care and home care for this winter.  I hope that will help the region.  Most importantly, we will deliver 150 extra beds for Limerick.  Work on a 60-bed unit in the hospital is under way.  I made an unannounced visit to see that work.  That unit will open next year.  We have 90 more beds provided for in the capital plan.  We are providing 150 beds that the people of the mid-west were promised years ago that nobody ever bothered delivering, but we are delivering them.  I know they would like them today, as we all would, but we now have the funding to get on and deliver that.<\/p> <p>Senator Coffey raised the issue of the Touching Hearts facility for children with physical and intellectual disabilities.  I would be very happy to meet that group with the Senator and see if we can progress it.  I am very much in admiration of the work it is doing in terms of the funding for a new facility on the grounds of St. Otteran&rsquo;s Hospital.  I would be delighted to convene a meeting for the Senator with that group in the coming weeks and see if we can work together on it.  I thank the Seanad for providing me with this opportunity to update the Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#HH00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2019: Second Stage","time":1571823000,"counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#JJ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I am delighted to bring this Bill to Second Stage.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris, for being present.  I am expecting Mental Health Reform representatives to attend after their day-long briefing in the Davenport Hotel, which was very interesting.  They are warriors who play an important role, along with all the other groups that raise community, well-being, mental health and disabilities issues, with the mantra &quot;Leave no one behind&quot;.  They are tireless campaigners for good mental health practice and we are indebted to them for the work they continue to do.  We continue to listen to them, be guided by them and be advised by them.  They are on the ground and they see the practicalities of legislation that has impacted upon many people's lives in a very negative and damaging way.  I also welcome to the Visitors Gallery Deputy Pat Buckley, who is the Sinn F&eacute;in D&aacute;il spokesperson on mental well-being and who was directly involved in this Bill.<\/p><p>We can look back and say that we have come a long way from the dark ages of the 1800s and the Lunacy Act, which is not long revoked in this country.  Under that Act, anyone could be incarcerated for life on the whim of another person, such as a family member, a priest, a policeman or somebody with money who was esteemed in the local village or town and who could get somebody incarcerated in an asylum for life for a minor misdemeanour, often where financial gain was to be had.  We have come a long way from that in seeking equality and inclusion for all and treatment for all who are vulnerable and in need of care.<\/p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 established a number of new legal provisions to address the issue of consent and capacity in regard to healthcare treatments for patients.  One such provision was the statutory right to develop and have respected as practicable advanced healthcare directives.  Advanced healthcare directives are documents in which a person specifies what action should be taken for their health if they are in the future compromised and no longer able to make decisions for themselves because of illness or incapacity.  A well-known example of such a directive is what is called a DNR, the &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; instructions often hanging at the end of a hospital bed.  This means that should a patient ordinarily require life-saving CPR or ventilation, that treatment will not be administered.<\/p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, while providing for directives, excludes people who are being treated as involuntary patients in the mental health services.  The Bill before the House today seeks to address that.  An involuntary patient does not, by definition, lack the capacity to make decisions about his or her care, welfare and future.  This is very clear in legislation, despite the exclusion of such patients from the right to advanced healthcare directives.  This Bill aims to give involuntary patients access to advanced healthcare directives like everybody else.  There is no solid evidence or argument for not doing so.<\/p><p>To make a distinction between voluntary and involuntary patients is clearly discriminatory under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Article 12 of the convention states, &quot;persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life&quot;, and Article 14 states, &quot;the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty&quot;.  This clearly shows that where a person has the capacity to make a decision for himself or herself and is discriminated against on the basis of other factors, this is in violation of his or her human rights and the mere existence of a mental health problem does not reach the level of a factor which removes capacity or justifies the removal of these basic rights.<\/p><p>We have done this far too frequently in the past.  As I said, we have come a long way.  In the past, for a person deemed by someone of so-called importance to be incapacitated, that person's life was finished and he or she ended up in circumstances which he or she had to endure the rest of his or her life because the powers ranged against that person were too powerful to overturn.  We are still discriminating in that somebody who is an involuntary patient cannot be brought along in the same way as a voluntary patient under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Everybody has capacity and we just determine how much that is, so everybody should be able to retain the right to make advanced healthcare directives regardless of their legal status within the mental health care system.<\/p><p>The use of differential standards reinforces the notion that the preferences of individuals with mental health conditions are not respected equally.  This Bill will help to destigmatise involuntary status and recognise patients as people who have agency and human rights that should be respected.  The legislation is important in terms of patient recovery.  Advanced healthcare directives can be particularly important in mental health care, where empowering people to involve themselves in their care recovery is shown to help and improve outcomes.  A survey of 600 psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers in 2006 showed that the vast majority thought advanced care planning for crisis would help to improve patients' overall mental healthcare.  The findings of a national study published in the journal, <i>Ethics, Medicine and Public Health<\/i>, suggests an urgent need for legally binding advanced healthcare directives for those who have been involuntarily detained under mental health legislation to provide a sense of control over future treatment, to enhance recovery, and to promote trust and respect.<\/p><p>The Minister is aware I have had a long professional career in mental health and psychiatry as a nurse.  I know the idea of trust and respect is paramount when working on a therapeutic level and trying to help people to get back to their lives without too much distress.  I often think of the times when people were involuntarily detained, and of the screaming, the dragging, the police and the whole terror around it all.  The one thing they would say was, &quot;They gave me ECT the last time.  Please do not let them do this to me again.  I beg you, please.&quot;  As they got sicker, they were considered involuntary and they were administered ECT.  They were in horror when they woke up and realised what had been done to them, but they had no choices and no individual right to say, &quot;No, and I want you to respect that.&quot;<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How, then, do we expect those patients to come back to us with an open mind and heart and a willingness to collaborate in their treatment?  It goes against the grain of a duty of care.  This Bill will correct that to a greater degree and I ask the House for its support in relation to it.<\/p><p>The US National Institute of Health at Duke University states that advance healthcare directives in mental health enhance involuntary patients' treatment satisfaction and perceived autonomy and improve treatment decision-making capacity among those labelled with severe mental illness.  With regard to fears around refusals of treatment, there is international evidence and national research which suggests that mental health service users or patients, whichever term Senator Kelleher prefers, are not interested in refusing all treatments and are more interested in using the directive to agree treatments with their consultants and psychiatrist and to opt into certain treatments over others based on their own treatment history and experience, which are things we must listen to and allow for.  Evidence further suggests the majority of advance healthcare directives include clear and valuable information, are consistent with clinical practice and can improve the quality of treatment decisions.<\/p><p>We have long waited for the rewriting of the Mental Health Act.  In fact, we have waited too long.  The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health has not changed mental health law with the exception of the closure of a loophole at the demand of the High Court which was fasttracked recently by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is not good enough.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which provides for advance healthcare decisions for voluntary patients only has not even been commenced.  This is the third Bill I have brought before the House notwithstanding the fact that I do not have an entire Department behind me.  While the Minister of State procrastinates, for whatever reason, people are suffering from the delay.  The Bill aims to address one aspect of their suffering.  I hope it will pass today.  We can wait no longer for meaningful change for those living with mental illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Devine on this legislation which cuts to the heart of mental healthcare in the State and the agency we provide to those receiving healthcare from the State.  In particular, the Bill seeks to provide for current advance healthcare directives legislation to be extended to involuntary patients.<\/p> <p>An involuntary patient does not, by definition, lack the capacity to make decisions about his or her care.  This is very clear in legislation, despite the exclusion of such patients from the right to advance healthcare directives.  That exclusion foments a stigma around involuntary patients to the effect that they are somehow incapable of making these decisions when this is, largely, not the case.  For example, between 2,000 and 2,500 people are detained against their will in psychiatric facilities every year.  In these facilities, they can be forcibly injected with medication, physically restrained by staff and locked in isolation.  This can happen easily by order of a GP, which can last for 21 days before the patient's case is reviewed by a mental health tribunal.  It is typical in cases where a patient experiences spells of having capacity and lacking capacity, including in respect of illnesses like schizophrenia.  Healthcare responses must be led by the idea that if a patient can assert his or her capacity and wishes not to undergo specific treatments, that capacity must be upheld and respected.  It is also important that where a patient's mental health is further established prior to any tribunal, he or she is not subject to treatment which causes irreparable damage and which could have been avoided if capacity was considered.<\/p> <p>When I consider this Bill, I think of the fact that homosexuality was removed from the diagnostic manual only in 1973.  The stigmatisation of homosexuality ensured generations of gay men were subject to the likes of electroconvulsive therapy and chemical castration against their will.  My own Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill 2018, which I hope to bring back to the House very soon, is a remedy for the ongoing coercion of the LGBT community into so-called therapies which can cause a person irreparable damage.  In addition, I note Senator Devine's work in this field.  This is further necessary amending legislation which she brings forward in addition to the Mental Health (Capacity to Consent to Treatment) Bill and the Health (Exemption of Charges for Involuntary Psychiatric Patients) (Amendment) Bill 2019.  Her work and that of Deputy Buckley in the D&aacute;il, as well as of many other parliamentarians in the Houses who champion mental health and continually bring forward robust responses to mental health needs in the State, should be commended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#KK00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#KK00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>What is needed is a robust overhaul of legislation via a new mental health Act, whether it is to implement the recommendations of A Vision for Change, which is now 13 years old, or the various reports completed in the intervening years.

In the transition from the old, archaic and inhumane buildings and wards of the past, we have put in place a different structure and environment on which we can build.  I am conscious of the work of my friend and former colleague, Liam Twomey, in this area.  Arising from the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, we have seen a new test for capacity, the putting in place of decision-making supports, decision-making representatives and an end to wardship.  There is a new regime which provides for powers of attorney, which is important.  We all agree with the more humane approach that is being taken in today's society.  We all agree that the patient deserves and requires a voice and a say in his or her treatment plan.  Equally, it is important that those of us who are advocates have that voice and participation right.  I say that as someone who works with a lot of people in the disabilities sector.  Advocates are very strong and a real requirement.  Senator Warfield referred to the LGBT community and I concur with the sentiment he articulated.<\/p> <p>The fundamental point is to ensure the voice or will of the person receiving mental health treatment is heard and respected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Mental Health Act 2001 is the law that governs how we operate.  One of the biggest failures in mental health services is the lack of a joined-up approach to the area of recovery.  There is a need to have a treatment plan for individual patients from beginning to end and then from discharge out into the community where there is a continuum of support and care given.  Too often when the patient is discharged or stops attending a particular organisation we tend to think that everything is fine.  A further structure needs to be put in place, a layer not of bureaucracy but of supports, around the issue of a recovery plan.<br\/><br\/>Some of what we have been doing - Senator Freeman made reference to it earlier in her speech in the debate around the mental health committee - helps to remove or reduce the stigma of mental ill-health.  In my 12 years in this House and the Lower House, I have always been a champion of bipartisanship and cross-party co-operation in committees, whether on mental health, the women's caucus, the eighth amendment or LGBT issues.  It is about bringing people with us rather than dividing and conquering.  In fairness, in the area of mental health, we have seen much progress because there has been such a co-operative collegial approach.<br\/><br\/>The Government is not opposing the Bill at this Stage.  However, we need to look at how, in areas where we find commonality, we can take it out of the bear pit that is the political chamber so that we can advance the cause, especially in the area of mental health.  For too long, mental health has been the Cinderella of the health service where people were locked away and were afraid to talk about it.  Suddenly, with <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, everybody came out from behind the wall and into the community.  In my humble opinion, there was no advanced planning.  Proper supports were not put in place.  We are playing catch-up now.  In many cases, we are not succeeding.<br\/><br\/>We are lucky in the mental health sector of the health system to have wonderful people providing a large range of services.  Whether it is the simple counselling element and the more complex psychiatry, it is phenomenal.  However, we have a road to travel.<br\/><br\/>As I stated earlier, we spend &euro;17 billion on health.  I reiterate the point that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark when &euro;17 billion in spending on the health system for a population of 5 million cannot achieve everything that we want.  I accept that there will always be a deficit or gap.  However, mental health is not income specific, geographically located or gender based, it is about people.  Whatever else I have learned in my life as a politician, the issue of mental health is about the person.  It is a complex matter.  At one level, there but for the grace of God go I.  That is why we as legislators have a duty of care and support to put in place structures and supports.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on the work that he is doing.  I thank Senator Devine for her advocacy on the Bill today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#KK00700","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Devine on her work on this area and the Bill that she is bringing forward and also commend Senator Freeman on the vast amount of work she has done in this area.  I welcome Deputy Pat Buckley to the House and commend him on the work he does in the Lower House with my colleague, Deputy James Browne.<\/p> <p>As a general practitioner, GP, I am delighted to support this Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill which seeks to ensure involuntary patients in hospitals for mental health treatment will have their advance healthcare directives respected.  Currently, involuntary mental health patients is the only group which is excluded from having a living will fulfilled.  It is important to ensure that involuntary patients have a voice in their treatment and have their will and preference for mental health treatment fulfilled and respected.<\/p> <p>I welcome the changes that have come about over the past number of years.  As a young fellow growing up in Castlerea where there was a large mental institution, St. Patrick's Hospital with 400 inpatients, in which my father worked as a plumber, I often played up in its playing fields.  They had a farm.  In thinking of that time and the time from when I was a medical student working in Grangegorman to when I was a psychiatric registrar working under the medical director, Dr. Blennerhassett, in Portrane, the developments must be welcomed.  On a day to day basis in the surgery, I am delighted to be treating patients in the community, keeping them in the community and not having to rely on these dreadful institutions where people were locked up inappropriately for many years.  The situation is improving and it is great that we are having this debate here tonight.<\/p> <p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Act 2015 provides laws for advance heathcare directives.  The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but it is not yet in effect.  A living will may be valid and enforceable.  By making such a statement, one may have withdrawn one's consent to the specific medical or surgical treatment, for example, as Senator Devine mentioned earlier, a do-not-resuscitate request.  It is not possible to state with absolute certainty that such a directive would be enforced because this depends on exactly what it says and whether it addresses the precise circumstances.<\/p> <p>In some countries, it is possible to appoint someone else to make decisions on one's behalf if one is not capable of making them for oneself.  In Ireland, this power is granted via an enduring power of attorney.  I see this in my role as a GP but also as a medical officer in a small district hospital.  An enduring power of attorney, however, does not specifically allow for the making of healthcare decisions by another person and while one may suggest to one's doctor or hospital that the wishes of certain persons may be considered, one cannot give anyone else any legal right to make decisions about one's healthcare.  People can make advance healthcare directives about a broad range of issues, such as the type of medication they prefer, the type of therapies that suit and work for them best and, most important, to treatment refusals - treatments that they do not want - such as electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.<\/p> <p>Under Irish law, people who are detained in hospital for mental health treatments are specific excluded from legally-binding advance healthcare directives.  As a doctor, I find this deeply upsetting and deeply troublesome.  That is why I am supporting this Bill today.  This exclusion is contrary to international human rights standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p>The Government has recognised that it is necessary to update the 2015 Act for Ireland to be compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was ratified by the Government in 2018.  In June 2016, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, publicly stated that the draft legislation to reform the Act would be completed by the end of that year.  I understand that delays happen with legislation but since then, numerous dates have come and gone.  Numerous dates have been given for publication of the draft legislation and none of them have been met.  These delays are problematic given the lengthy duration of the review of the Act and the seriousness of the gaps in human rights protections, both for adults and children, receiving inpatient and mental health treatment.<\/p> <p>As a GP and as a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, I am happy to support this Bill to ensure that the most vulnerable who often do not have a voice - involuntary patients in mental health institutions - will have their wishes respected.

I thank Senator Buttimer for his kind words and acknowledgement.  His insight into mental health services was very intelligent and compassionate, not just now but also earlier today.

Addressing the question was the purpose of the committee.  I agree with absolutely everything Senator Buttimer said.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Devine.  She and I have been fighting the same battle for the past three years.  We are allies in fighting.  I have learned over the years that I know very little about most things.  Therefore, I have always surrounded myself with experts.  The Minister of State has an expert here today in Senator Devine, who was immersed for most of her adult life in psychiatric care.  She knows exactly how it should work and what should happen to make it work.  Her Bill is important because it is one more step towards removing the stigma associated with mental illness.<\/p> <p>There are two personal points I wish to make.  I went to the doctor recently with a certain medical issue and he advised me what treatment I should opt for.  I had the right to accept or reject the treatment.  Just think how disempowering it is if someone who is brought into the mental health services involuntarily is ignored and not included in his or her own treatment and life.  How weak, fragile and unheard one must feel when somebody does not listen to one and include one in the decision.<\/p> <p>On the second personal point, my husband and I are in the throes of enjoying power of attorney, which was mentioned by Senator Swanick.  We are selecting somebody but we are also in the throes of dealing with a living will.  We have the capacity, respect and dignity to be able to do that.  For God's sake, can we not accord that same dignity and respect to the most vulnerable?<\/p> <p>I do not know whether the Government will support Senator Devine's Bill.

I compliment Deputy Pat Buckley and his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues on this progressive legislation, which should, and I expect will, attract cross-party support.<\/p> <p>As a psychiatric nurse by profession and having served with Senator Freeman when she chaired the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care and on the cross-party alliance and the all-party Oireachtas group on dementia, I am aware that Senator Devine knows her stuff.  She is a very powerful advocate for the underdog and for those who are hard to reach.  She is an advocate for ensuring that voices that are seldom heard or not heard at all are indeed heard.  She combines practicality, compassion, humour and an unwavering belief in making real human rights for those who may be vulnerable and end up in trouble.  It is not just pie in the sky.  I am delighted to be here today to speak in support of the Senator's Bill.<\/p> <p>Assisted decision-making is about honouring people's will and preference, not the paternalistic best-interest concepts that for too long took power away from people and made their will and preferences second order to the convenience of others or even to abuse, incarceration or exploitation.  I know what I speak about because I remember some of the treatments a close member of my family received for her mental health conditions.  These included over-medication and electric shock treatment, to which I very much doubt she ever consented.  Her mental health issues were largely created by a coercively controlling marriage relationship with someone who was, of course, of good standing in the world but not so nice at home.  This Bill's welcome focus is on people who experience mental health issues and their treatment under the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  This Bill, if passed, will do a very important thing; it will remove the current exclusion of people with mental health difficulties under Irish law from having legally binding advance healthcare directives provided for in Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  As said before, this exclusion is contrary to international human rights standards and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p>Treatment is fundamentally about consent.  Section 83(2) of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 clarified that an adult who has capacity is entitled to refuse treatment, for any reason, even if it seems unwise to others or not based on sound medical principles or if it may even result in death.  An advanced healthcare directive allows a person who has capacity to state what treatment he or she does not want in the event that he or she loses capacity in the future.  In this way, we can all provide now for our capacitous voice to be heard in the future.  To make an advance healthcare directive in the first place, a person must have capacity, but the directive actually comes into effect only when we do not have it.  As the law stands, an advance healthcare directive does not have to be complied with if, when one loses capacity, one is detained under the Mental Health Act, and if it relates to the refusal of mental health treatments.  In other words, one can refuse antibiotics but one cannot refuse antipsychotics.  This exception offends against parity between physical and mental health and it overlooks the fact that those with mental ill health, as with those with physical ill health, are often accomplished experts in their own care.  We often know best ourselves what is best for ourselves.  The exclusion of an individual with mental health difficulties is discriminatory and cannot in any way be fair, right or justifiable.  This Bill would remove section 85(7), containing the exception.  According to the Decision Support Service, which is in favour of the Bill, this is very good.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine's legislation very much complements Deputy Brown's Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, which received cross-party support in both Houses.  The latter was all about the environment of people with mental difficulties such that they could be given more choice and control over their treatment.  Senator Devine's Bill follows in the same vein and has the support of Mental Health Reform and 75 member organisations.  This Bill is also supported by Safeguarding Ireland, which highlighted that this issue was raised as far back as 2014 in an expert report on the Mental Health Act.  As previously mentioned, there is an argument that section 85(7) is not in compliance with the UN convention, for whose ratification the Minister of State fought so very hard.<\/p> <p>A person with mental health issues should and must have the same rights as all others relating to advance healthcare directives and more.  For the sake of, and with respect for people with mental health conditions, who must be always first among equals regarding their health and treatment, I fully support Senator Devine's enlightened Bill.  I wish it safe passage through both Houses and into law so as to have a better, more respectful and equal day for those experiencing mental illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#MM00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

A number of my Trinity College colleagues have done a lot of research on this, notably Damien Brennan, whose text, <i>Irish Insanity<\/i>, makes the point that Ireland had far higher levels of incarceration in psychiatric institutions than any other European country for many decades of the 20th century.  We detained and confined people in institutions and many of them, sadly, became institutionalised as a result.  We did this without any of the safeguards we should have had and which we eventually introduced.<br\/><br\/>We are coming late to the reform of mental health procedures.  The Mental Health Act 2001, which is now subject to justified criticism, was itself important reforming legislation and was a huge improvement on what had gone before.  There have been other steps since then, with progressive stages of reform, but we are still a long way off the system that should be in place in a modern European state in 2019.  I know the Minister of State agrees with this.  The national mental health strategy of 2006 set out A Vision for Change and made some important recommendations.  That was followed by the predecessor of the current Minister of State, my Labour Party colleague, Kathleen Lynch, who had huge commitment to mental health reform and who instituted a review in 2012 of the 2001 Act which resulted in a range of recommendations, only some of which have been implemented.  I was a member of the justice committee which conducted a series of hearings prior to the enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 around the need for reform of capacity legislation, particularly in the area of wardship.  In many areas, reforms have been debated and discussed but we are not seeing their full implementation and we are falling short of the standards we should have, particularly as we have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.<br\/><br\/>I am grateful to the NGOs that have been briefing us on this, in particular Mental Health Reform and Justice for Wards, which has provided us with information.  As they point out, we still fall short of UNCRPD standards.  Our 2001 Act is outdated and a number of important reforms need to be made.  Others have spoken about another progressive step in the area of reform, namely, Deputy James Browne's Private Members' Bill, which was passed last year in a spirit of co-operation across the D&aacute;il.  This Bill is entirely in keeping with, and indeed complementary to, the reforms put forward in the 2018 Act.  The Bill deals with just one aspect of the necessary reform of mental health law and, if passed, will provide involuntary patients in psychiatric institutions with the right to have their advance wishes about treatment respected and will extend the right to have advance healthcare directives for those who are detained in mental health services.  Under the 2015 legislation, they would be excluded from this legal right.  An advance healthcare directive is a statement set out by someone, when he or she has capacity to make decisions, about his or her preferences for future care and will only take effect if and when the person is unwell and no longer has decision-making capacity.  It is a very important principle, like that of enduring power of attorney and Senator Freeman, among others, has spoken of her own experience of such matters.<br\/><br\/>We know of the experience of persons in psychiatric services.  Mental Health Reform conducted a survey, My Voice Matters, and almost 40% of participants who used mental health services felt they were not involved as much as they would like in decisions about the medications they took.  Permitting people in involuntary detention to make advance healthcare directives is an important way of ensuring people feel more listened to and that their wishes are respected.  I am proud and happy to support this legislation and hope we will not divide the House on it.  I commend Senator Devine and look forward to its speedy enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#MM00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2019, a Private Members' Bill introduced by Senators M&aacute;ire Devine, Rose Conway-Walsh and Paul Gavan.  I am here to represent my ministerial colleagues, Deputy Harris and Deputy Jim Daly, who were unable to be here today and send their apologies.  I will, of course, brief them on the matters arising in today's debate.  I particularly thank Senators Devine, Warfield, Buttimer, Freeman, Swanick, Kelleher and Bacik for their contributions.  I also welcome Deputy Pat Buckley, who does a lot of work on this issue and makes a huge contribution to the debates on it in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>This Bill seeks to amend Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to ensure that patients who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 will have their advance healthcare directives complied with.  The Department of Health is supportive of the overall policy intention behind the amendment.  In relation to those detained under the Mental Health Act 2001, the Department agrees that advance healthcare directives should apply to those detained under the Act on the same basis as they do to persons with physical illness.  Therefore, the Government does not oppose this Bill.  However, this position is subject to engagement with Sinn F&eacute;in to amend the Bill later in the legislative process to overcome various substantive and drafting issues that arise with it.  I will outline these issues in more detail shortly.<\/p> <p>An advance healthcare directive is a statement made by an individual with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity.  The purpose of these provisions is to provide a legislative framework for an adult individual to make a legally binding advance healthcare directive to refuse treatment.  The advance healthcare directive has been recognised as an expression of an individual's autonomy and as a useful tool in enabling the individual to maintain some level of control over medical treatment into the future, when he or she lacks the capacity to express autonomous preferences.  More and more people wish to continue to play an active role in their treatment decisions, even when they no longer retain capacity to do so.<\/p> <p>Part 8 of the Act of 2015 puts in place a legislative framework to facilitate those people, who wish to do so, to outline their will and preferences for future treatment in the event that they lose capacity.  Part 8 provides for an adult individual to make a legally binding advance healthcare directive to refuse treatment.  In order to make an advance healthcare directive a person has to be over 18 years of age and must have capacity.  In order for a refusal of treatment in an advance healthcare directive to be considered legally binding, the person must lack capacity to consent to the treatment at the time in question.  The treatment being refused must be clearly identified and the specific situations in which the treatment refusal is intended to apply must also be clearly outlined.  The provisions will also enable a person to outline specific treatment requests in his or her directive.  These requests would not be legally binding but would have to be taken into consideration during the decision-making process relating to that person's treatment.<\/p> <p>The provisions introduce a mechanism through which an adult with capacity may nominate in his or her directive a legal representative, who is aware of the person's will and preference, to be involved in the healthcare decision-making process on his or her behalf in the event that he or she loses capacity.  This nominee is known as the designated healthcare representative.  Evidence shows that advance healthcare directives are a useful tool in enhancing patient autonomy and empowerment.  In the context of mental health, these directives can have a positive therapeutic impact for patients and play an important role in patient recovery.  The recognition of patient autonomy and the application of the recovery approach are key components of the Government's policy on mental health, A Vision for Change, and are important considerations in the ongoing revision of the Mental Health Act 2001.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Facilitating the participation of people with mental illness in making decisions regarding their treatment acknowledges that such people generally know best what works for them.  The reason those detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 were excluded from the scope of advance healthcare directives was that when the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was being drafted, a review of the Mental Health Act 2001 was also under way.  It was decided that the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 should be completed before any change was made regarding the treatment of those detained under the Mental Health Act 2001.<\/p><p>The report of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 recommended the introduction of legislation providing for advance healthcare directives which should apply to mental health on an equal basis with general health.  On that basis, the general aim of the Bill is in line with Department of Health policy.  The previous Government agreed with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 and approved the preparation of the general scheme of a Bill to amend the 2001 Act to reflect the recommendations of the review in revised legislation.  Work is progressing in the Department of Health on these important amendments, with draft heads of the Bill currently with the Mental Health Commission for its observations.  Some Senators referred to delays in this regard.  It is essential that the Mental Health Commission, which has a significant and important role in overseeing the safeguards provided in the Act, has full input into the framing of the many amendments to be included in revised mental health legislation.  This is a phase in the process and the commission likely to require a period in the region of six months to study and comment on the draft heads.  I mentioned earlier that the Government does not oppose the Bill.  However, I must again stress that there are certain issues of drafting and of substance that need to be addressed.<\/p><p>At present, there are four major areas of concern.  The first is that for advance healthcare directives generally, a request for specific treatment is not legally binding on a healthcare professional but will be taken into consideration when a treatment decision is being made.  Section 2(b) states that an advance healthcare directive shall be complied with in respect of treatment given.  This appears to make a request for specific treatment by a directive-maker detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 legally binding on a healthcare professional, regardless of the appropriateness of that treatment, while a request from any other directive-maker is not legally binding.  It is unclear whether this anomaly is intended or what is the policy justification for it.  Either way, the implications for the operation of Part 8 of the 2015 Act could be significant and it could make the legislation susceptible to constitutional challenge on the grounds of equality.  That is a concern and we must monitor the position in respect of it.<\/p><p>The second area of concern is that the Bill does not address the very specific scenario where an involuntary patient whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 lacks capacity but has a valid advance healthcare directive that refuses all treatment.  At the moment, a person who has capacity and is detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 can refuse all treatment and, in such circumstances, his or her detention could continue even if he or she is receiving no treatment.  However, the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 recommended that the criteria for detention outlined in the current Act be amended so that in future if no treatment is being received by the patient, then the detention should no longer continue.  This change clearly reflects the view that psychiatric hospitals are where ill patients go to get treatment.  Where an advance healthcare directive refusing all treatment is being invoked in the case of a patient who is being involuntarily detained and lacks capacity, the Department of Health will need to carefully consider whether such a scenario needs to be provided for, and what that provision should be.  The question also arises as to whether such provision should apply only where another person's life might be in danger, where the life of the detained person may be in danger or where his or her health may be in danger.<\/p><p>The third area of concern is that, in addition to patients detained under the Mental Health Act 2001, Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 applies to patients in a designated centre under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, including those who are not fit to stand trial, who are not guilty by reason of insanity and who have been transferred from a prison to a designated centre for treatment of a mental disorder which they cannot receive in the prison.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, has noted that the provisions cited in section 2(a), namely, section 4(3)(b)(i) and (ii) and section 4(5)(c)(i) and (ii) of the Criminal Law Insanity Act 2006, only address committals where an accused is unfit to be tried.  The Minister has informed me that the proposed amendments in section 2(a) should also apply to orders under section 5(2) and section 15 of the 2006 Act.  Section 5(2) provides for a committal to a designated centre following a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, and section 15 provides for a transfer of a prisoner deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder for which he or she cannot receive adequate treatment in the prison, to a designated centre in order to receive the necessary treatment.  Failure to provide for these matters could cause a serious problem with the application of orders under the 2006 Act.  The Minister for Justice and Equality would be particularly concerned that a situation could arise where a person who has in place a valid advance healthcare directive, refusing psychiatric treatment, may not be treated if he or she is detained in the Central Mental Hospital following a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity or following a transfer from a prison to the Central Mental Hospital.<\/p><p>The fourth issue is that the Long Title of the Bill seeks to bring about improvements for patients detained both under the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  Subject to the previously outlined concerns of the Minister for Justice and Equality being resolved, the Long Title may need to be amended in respect of those who are detained pursuant to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that the main provisions of Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 have not yet commenced, so while advance healthcare directives are on the Statute Book, no person can benefit from this legislation until further sections are commenced.  Therefore, there is time to deliberate on the concerns outlined to form the basis of a considered view of how best to proceed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and Department of Health officials will work with the Senators to address these matters.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Devine and the other Senators involved on their work in this area.  I also commend their commitment to work in the interests of the rights, will and preference of the patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#NN00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.

For too long, people with mental health difficulties were especially prone to being left out of inclusive development efforts.

The effect of the amendment of Article 41.3.2&deg; is that the Constitution no longer provides for a minimum living apart period for spouses who wish to apply for a divorce and that such a period may be defined in law by the Oireachtas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The amendment has given the Oireachtas the flexibility to legislate to ease the burden on people who have experienced the tragedy of marriage breakdown and wish to have an opportunity to begin again.  While a living apart period is no longer prescribed in the Constitution, the period of four years during the previous five years specified in section 5(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 continues to have effect until this provision is amended by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Prior to the referendum, the Government gave a commitment that if the referendum was passed, a Bill would be introduced to reduce the minimum living apart period in the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 to two years during the previous three years.  Before bringing the proposals to Cabinet, I engaged with colleagues on all sides of the Oireachtas and I greatly value the widespread, cross-party agreement that two years would be an appropriate period to specify in legislation at this time.  I recall the consensus being that achieving consensus was an important factor in the success of the referendum proposal when considered by the people of Ireland in May.<br\/><br\/>Reducing the living apart period will enable couples whose marriages have broken down with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation to regularise their affairs in a more timely manner.  A shorter living apart period will also have the potential to reduce the legal costs involved, as couples would be less likely to need to apply for a judicial separation or make a formal separation agreement while waiting to become eligible to apply for a divorce.  Following the constitutional amendment, I published the general scheme of the Family Law Bill in July.  I thank the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for agreeing that it was not necessary to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny at that level, given the extensive debate that had already taken place in the Houses and among the wider public.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title of the Bill and for its commencement by order to be made by the Minister for Justice and Equality.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 2 of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989.  Section 2(1)(a) amends section 2(1) of the Act of 1989 to allow an application for judicial separation to be made after one year living apart, whether or not the respondent spouse consents to the decree of judicial separation being granted.  Section 2(1)(<i>e<\/i>) of the Act of 1989 currently provides for a living apart period of three years where the respondent does not consent to the decree of judicial separation being granted.  As it would be undesirable to have a longer living apart period for judicial separation applications than for divorce applications, it is proposed that the living apart period in such cases be reduced to one year.  This would be consistent with section 2(1)(<i>d<\/i>) of the Act of 1989, which provides for a living apart period of one year where the respondent consents to the decree of judicial separation being granted.  Section 2(1)(c) will clarify the meaning of the &quot;living apart&quot; requirement for judicial separation applications in section 2(3)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Act of 1989.  I carefully listened to the comments made during the discussion of the Bill to amend the Constitution about issues that can arise where a marriage has broken down where the spouses continue to live in the same house but in fact are living separate lives.  I consider that the Oireachtas should provide clarity and legal certainty to the interpretation that has been given by Irish courts to the living apart requirement.  The new text will provide that spouses who live in the same dwelling as one another shall be considered as living apart from one another if the court is satisfied that, while so living in the same dwelling, the spouses do not live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 5 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  Subsection (1)(a)(i) will reduce the minimum living apart period specified in section 5(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Act of 1996 from four years during the previous five years to two years during the previous three years.  Subsection (1)(a)(ii) will clarify the meaning of the &quot;living apart&quot; requirement for divorce applications by giving certainty to the interpretation that has been given by the Irish courts to that requirement.  The new provision will make clear that &quot;spouses who live in the same dwelling as one another shall be considered as living apart from one another if the court is satisfied that, while so living in the same dwelling, the spouses do not live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship&quot;.  Senators will be aware that the general scheme of the Bill included a provision to enable spouses whose judicial separation application is pending before a court to be granted a divorce if they had been living apart for at least two years during the previous three years.  However, as this matter is already adequately provided for by section 39 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, it is not necessary to make specific provision for it in this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 provides for the amendment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  Subsection (1) will insert a new subsection (1A) into section 110 of the Act of 2010.  The new subsection will clarify the meaning of the &quot;living apart&quot; requirement for applications for dissolution of a civil partnership to ensure consistency with the provisions on judicial separation and divorce in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Subsection (2) provides for the amendment of section 172 of the Act of 2010.  These amendments are consequential on amendments to the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 provided for in section 3 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The background to these provisions is that Part 15 of the 2010 Act established a redress scheme which allows a financially dependent cohabitant to apply to court for certain remedies.  Section 172(5) of the 2010 Act defines a &quot;qualified cohabitant&quot; for the purposes of the redress scheme as one of a couple who at the end of the relationship, through death or otherwise, have cohabited for at least five years, or two years where there is a dependent child of the relationship.  Section 172(6) makes particular provision for cases in which one or both of the cohabitants is married to another person.  That subsection provides that a cohabitant who is married to someone else will not be a qualified cohabitant if he or she has not lived apart from his or her spouse for at least four years during the previous five years.  Consideration was given to reducing the living apart period in section 172(6) to two years during the previous three years in order to ensure a measure of consistency with the proposed amendment to section 5 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  However, a person cannot simultaneously be living with his or her spouse and be a cohabitant as defined in section 172.  There could not be a situation in which a married cohabitant would satisfy the cohabitation requirement of section 172(5) without having lived apart from his or her spouse for at least two years.  It is proposed to amend section 172(6) of the Act of 2010 so that it will apply only where the cohabitation relationship concerned ends before the coming into operation of section 4(2) of this Bill.  Section 4(2)(b) will amend section 172(6) to provide that the term &quot;lived apart&quot; in that subsection shall be construed in accordance with the new section 5(1A) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 to be inserted by section 3 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I turn to Part 3, which sets out arrangements for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the United Kingdom.  This will arise in the event of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union without a deal.  Part 3 will be brought into operation only if and when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement that covers this area of law.  At present, the recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment obtained in the United Kingdom is governed by EU Council Regulation No. 2201\/2003, known as the Brussels IIA Regulation.  Under this, divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted in all EU member states except for Denmark are entitled to recognition in other member states if granted in accordance with the jurisdictional criteria specified in the regulation.  Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition.  The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 governs the recognition of a divorce granted in a country outside of the European Union.  Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled on the date the divorce proceedings were instituted.  The determination of &quot;domicile&quot; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction.  This has proved complex to determine in many instances.  The Government wishes to ensure that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the arrangements for recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK will continue to be on the basis of habitual residence rather than the domicile provisions in the Act of 1986.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 makes general provision for Part 3.  Subsection (1) defines certain terms for the purposes of Part 3.  &quot;Council Regulation&quot; is defined as meaning EU Council Regulation No. 2201\/2003.  &quot;Relevant jurisdiction&quot; is defined as meaning England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Gibraltar.  The provisions of Part 3 will need to apply to Gibraltar because the Council regulation extends to the jurisdiction of Gibraltar.  Subsection (2) provides that section 5 of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 shall not apply to a divorce to which section 6 or section 7 applies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 6 provides that a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted under the law of a jurisdiction of the United Kingdom or Gibraltar that, prior to the coming into operation of the section, was recognised under the Council regulation shall continue to be recognised.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides for recognition of divorces, legal separations or marriage annulments granted under the law of a jurisdiction of the United Kingdom or Gibraltar on or after the coming into operation of the section.  Section 7(2) sets out the jurisdictional criteria for recognition of such a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment.  The criteria correspond with the jurisdiction requirements of the Council regulation.  Section 7(3) sets out the grounds for refusal of recognition of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted under the law of a relevant jurisdiction.  The grounds of refusal correspond with the grounds of refusal of recognition set out in the Council regulation.<\/p><p>It is my desire, subject to the wishes of Senators, that this Bill will be enacted before 31 October so that in the event of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union on that date without an agreement, Part 3 can be brought into operation with effect from the withdrawal date.

Yesterday's changes in the North added to the changes which have taken place in this State in the context of marriage equality and women's health.  These changes reflect a more compassionate, caring and changing society.  I am in no way suggesting that people who are opposed to the changes, especially in the context of women's health, are not compassionate or caring people but the changes underway have the support of the vast majority of the people of Ireland, North and South.  That majority must, of course, be mindful to be inclusive of those who remain unconvinced of the need for change and what is required to take place in the time ahead.<\/p> <p>The Family Law Bill before the Seanad encapsulates the care and compassion for which people in this State voted and the people of the North who waited for a long, painful time for the changes that took place yesterday.

That day has finally arrived.<\/p> <p>There are a number of elements of the Family Law Bill designed to recognise and overcome the difficulties that arise when relationships break down.  It reduces to two years the minimum living apart period and makes provision for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law in the UK in the event that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement.  It gives legal certainty to the courts to grant, under specified circumstances, an application for spouses to apply for judicial separation or divorce.  A corresponding provision will deal with the dissolution of civil partnerships.  It also reduces to one year the current minimum living apart period of three years that applies to judicial separation applications in cases where the respondent does not consent to the decree of judicial separation being granted.<\/p> <p>These are welcome steps forward to help people at very difficult and turbulent times and an emotionally highly charged situation and period in their lives.

The Labour Party pushed for a divorce referendum in 1986.  That referendum was held but, sadly, failed..  There was such an impact on many people whose marriages had broken down and who were denied the possibility of remarrying until, finally, the right to remarry campaign and Divorce Action Group succeeded in getting the referendum passed in November 1995.  That referendum was also held largely at the instigation of the Labour Party, which was then in a rainbow coalition with Fine Gael and the Democratic Left.  I was too young to be involved in the 1986 campaign but the 1995 referendum was passed by a very narrow majority of 9,114 votes.  That margin was so tight and the campaign so bitterly contested that it is very interesting to see how far we have come in the years since.<\/p> <p>The referendum on 24 May this year on the thirty-eighth amendment to the Constitution was initiated by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to whom I wish to pay tribute for providing the momentum for this reform.  That referendum was passed with a majority of 82%.  There was clearly an appetite for moving towards reform of divorce law and a growing recognition that the provision that had been put into the Constitution in 1995 by a very narrow majority which required couples to have lived apart for four out of the previous five years was too restrictive and was causing serious and unnecessary obstacles to couples who had already faced the tragic circumstance of a marriage breakdown.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The mandatory four-year period was one of the longest in the world.  It had the effect of forcing couples into a cumbersome two-stream legal procedure where they had to seek a judicial separation to regularise their situation following marriage breakdown, but then still had to wait for the four years to pass before they could seek a divorce, even where they had formed new relationships in the meantime and wished to achieve legal recognition for those.<\/p><p>We are all well aware of the compassionate and practical reasons this referendum was so important and we were also all aware at the time that despite the dire predictions around the 1995 referendum, the Irish divorce rate had remained low at 0.7% when I looked at it.  That was one of the lowest rates in Europe, where the average was 1.9%.  Marriage rates have remained strong, and since the 2015 marriage equality referendum, gay couples have the right to marry too.  Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I am delighted to note and acknowledge the change in the law in Northern Ireland as of this week to ensure marriage equality will be recognised there from January 2020.  It is an important and momentous reform for Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I am glad we are moving ahead with reforms and I support them.  I am particularly glad to see the clarification being inserted into this legislation in recognition of the jurisprudence on the area of living apart to clarify that, as the Minister said in his speech and as is in the legislation, \"spouses who live in the same dwelling as one another shall be considered as living apart from one another if the court is satisfied that, while so living in the same dwelling, the spouses do not live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship\".  That reflects the case law on both separation and divorce.  I am glad to see that and to see the provisions around recognition of foreign marriages.  That is also another important part of this legislation.  I support the legislation and will support its speedy passage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102300002#RR00700","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571823000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing forward this Bill.  The issue has already been decided in the referendum and the necessary changes have been made.  In looking back at my involvement in the court process, I remember my first family law case, which was not that long ago.  The judge kept adjourning the matter and would not deal with it.  This is not a criticism of the judge, who has passed away since, but of the approach.  For seven days in a row the case kept being adjourned until the final day of the term.  A decision was given on dealing with the sale of a property.  The issue at the time was that family law was not even being dealt with by the courts.  The other recollection I have is of dealing with an annulment case where it was far easier to get a church annulment at the time than it was to get a State annulment.  I spent six days in the High Court on a State annulment case where a former President, who was then a senior counsel, was a senior counsel on the other side.  Every issue and part of that case was contested.  Those were the complications of family law.  It was extremely expensive and difficult.  Unfortunately, the annulment process was one of the only processes available.  Even though it was difficult, we were successful in this case and subsequently we were successful in the Supreme Court as well, but I mention the sheer difficulties people had.<\/p> <p>There was no law really dealing with this matter.  Looking at it in real terms, it was the former Deputy Shatter who brought forward the first family law Bill in 1976.  Looking at it now, the real legislation in the area that we are amending now was brought forward in 1989, again by the former Deputy Shatter, and that was brought forward as a Private Member's Bill rather than as a Government Bill.  We are now dealing with it as a Government Bill, and rightly so, to amend that Act of more than 30 years ago.  It is interesting how it was a Private Member's Bill that started off this process.  It is important we acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, in bringing forward the Bill and the subsequent amendment.<\/p> <p>It is important that we regularise this issue and that where we cater for where all the evidence is.  This Bill also defines the issue of living apart.  Circumstances have changed in this area.  We had the economic downturn where people could not physically afford to move into separate accommodation.  This Bill is dealing with that issue as well, and that is a welcome development.  The changes are welcome.  The people have spoken on this and given their decision.  It is our job to bring forward the legislation, to put it in place and to give effect to it.  It is also important to acknowledge that we also need to cater for where there is a no-deal Brexit scenario.  We need to plan carefully so we do not end up in the legal complications that occurred previously.  Before the divorce legislation was introduced here, it was not unusual for people to apply for divorce in the UK, causing a lot of legal complications, especially where one of the parties subsequently died, as that raised questions on whether that divorce was valid or should be validly recognised, which caused problems in the distribution of the estate.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister, the Department and all the people involved in bringing forward this Bill.  This legislation deals with all those issues.  It is a complex area.  I am involved in a family law matter that has been going on for 18 years.  Unfortunately, it is not straightforward.  Therefore, it is important that when we bring legislation forward, we try to cover all the complexities and difficulties that arise so that judges and the Judiciary can deal with the decisions and can make a decision that accommodates the best way forward for the people involved.<\/p> <p>I welcome this Bill.  It is important we get it through.
