The amendment tabled by the Deputy has been ruled out of order but I appreciate the concern he has raised and for whom he raised it.  When considering the amendments we sought the advice of the Attorney General.  Unfortunately, it is not something that can be facilitated.  In devising the interim arrangement it was necessary to respect the current legislative provision that these individuals were required to retire at 65 years of age.  They did so and received their pension benefits.<\/p><p>The interim arrangements were established to offer a limited temporary solution to individuals who reached the age of 65 in the period between the Government decision of 5 December and the commencement date of the necessary legislation.  If the arrangements had not been in existence, this cohort of people would not have been able to continue working.<\/p><p> Not to labour the point, we are very anxious that we would have a conclusion and draw a line under this.  The sooner we can get this enabling legislation enacted, the sooner any others who could wind up in that interim arrangement will be facilitated by the passage of the Bill.  I know the committee is aware, through my officials, that there are many complicating factors in regard to people who have already started to draw down their pensions and those who have retired but who did not avail of the interim arrangements because they were told this was only an interim arrangement.  On the basis of the legal advice we have received, and having reflected on the amendments, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has decided to proceed with the original decision of 5 December last year, which was that the interim arrangement would stand pending the enabling of this legislation, and we would move forward on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018121100002#A01000","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544536800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien noted, a similar amendment was ruled out of order.

Yet, one year later, it has not been enacted and the light has been turned out for a whole cohort of people who had an expectation.  While I acknowledge the amendments as proposed may be a charge on the State, we are asking that the Minister would prepare a remedy or a suite of measures that might be possible within a few months, in light of the acknowledgment of the commitment that was made this time last year but, unfortunately, was not acted upon in time through enabling legislation.

It was made clear at the time, as everybody would accept, that the interim arrangements were just that - interim - until such time as we had enabling legislation enacted.  I go back to my previous point.  There is a group of people who, in recent months, did not avail of the interim arrangements because of what was said at the time, namely, that they were just interim arrangements.  If we are now proposing to reverse engines, where does that leave those who did not avail of the interim arrangements, where does it leave the pension contributions that have been paid, where does it leave Revenue and where does it leave those people's point on the scale?  There are many questions.<\/p> <p>  To be fair, the Deputies have engaged on this.  We will discuss Deputy Cowen's amendment later.  The Minister is prepared to accept in principle the suggestion that Deputy Cowen has made but, in doing so, to point out that this may require legislative remedies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018121100002#B00300","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1544536800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Three reasons were given by the officials.  One was that some of those public sector workers may not have been re-hired in the role they were in and they may be in new roles.  The second was that some of those workers no longer pay into the old pension scheme and, if they resumed employment on a permanent basis at the old salary scale they had left, then a new pension scheme would have to be put in place.  The Minister of State might clarify if that is the case.  The third reason was that if public sector workers were simply given the option of resuming work until the age of 70 under the same terms and conditions as exist under the current interim arrangements, they would receive significantly less in salary compared to workers who are turning  65.  The argument was put forward that it is a principle of pay equality.  I find this a bit strange, given we have no problem with 60,000 post-2011 entrants earning less than their colleagues for equivalent work.  I do not agree with that reason, which I think is a bit of a red herring.  With regard to the first two reasons, do we know the number of public sector workers under the circular who are in the roles they were in when they reached 65 and the number who have started new roles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018121100002#B00400","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1544536800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is approximately 450.

Given the number of people who retire on an annual basis, it would be desperately unfair to rewind and say we will now have to reopen the whole thing, which would be one of the remedies we would have to consider.  The Bill would then be in a very difficult position and we would probably not be able to carry it forward.  All of that new cohort of people who, from 1 January, are hoping to be able to avail of this will not be able to avail of it.

What starts out as something voluntary, and in this case voluntary and with the agreement of the Minister, can over time morph into something that becomes the norm.  The fact people are living longer and healthier lives just goes to become a benefit for the employer, as opposed to people having a long and healthy retirement.  If it would lead to guarantees of decent pensions and so on, that is fair enough.<\/p><p>I would be interested to hear the responses of Deputy O'Brien and the Minister to that point.  The social context is the flipside of that.  Maybe it is a broader question.  Has the Minister done any studies on it?

In addition, the maximum age of 75 is included in order to further assist the Minister in the exercise of his power.

Although the report identifies some downsides to this proposal, for example in terms of new recruits, it focuses on some of the positives in areas like the retention of skills.  Obviously, there is a cost if people are working longer.  There is a need for continuous professional development.  The report mentions the impact that this proposal would have on other legislation.

Deputies will accept that this is of particular relevance for students preparing for State examinations.  This arrangement is currently provided for in various pension schemes in the education sector.  The Bill, as currently drafted, does not allow the continuation of this arrangement.

Amendments to sections 4 and 5 of the Bill are being proposed in that regard.  An amendment to section 4 is required to ensure any service rendered by affected staff in the period between their 70th birthday and their retirement at the end of the school or academic year will be reckonable for pension purposes.  An amendment to section 5 is required to ensure that a statutory instrument or public service pension scheme which provides for a compulsory retirement age will be read as meaning the age of 70 for relevant public servants or, in the case of certain relevant public servants in the education sector, the end of the school or academic year in which they reach that age.  Both provisions are limited to public service pension schemes made or approved by the Minister for Education and Skills with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018121100002#C01800","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Section 4, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544536800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, lines 4 to 8, to delete all words from and including &quot;The&quot; in line 4 down to and including &quot;accordingly&quot; in line 8 and substitute the following:&quot;The provisions of any public service pension scheme or statutory instrument (within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 2005) that require, or the effect of which is to require, a relevant public servant to retire or cease holding office or employment upon attaining a specified age shall be read, subject to this Act, as requiring the relevant public servant to retire or cease to hold office upon attaining the age of 70 years or, where a higher age is prescribed under section 3A(2), upon attaining that higher age, subject to any extension provided for in any such scheme or instrument as is made, approved or consented to by the Minister for Education and Skills, with the consent of the Minister&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018121100002#C02200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Section 5, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544536800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544536800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>As amendments Nos. 10 and 12 are related, they may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018121100002#C02700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1544536800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 10:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:&quot;Amendment of section 29 of Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017<br \/><br \/><b>8.<\/b>Section 29 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 is amended&mdash;<blockquote>(a) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):<blockquote>&quot;(1) In this Part, 'pensionable pay', in relation to a public servant and in respect of a specified period, means&mdash;<blockquote>(a) basic pay (excluding overtime) due to the public servant in respect of that period, and<br \/><br \/>(b) allowances, emoluments or premium pay (or its equivalent) so due to him or her which, by virtue of subsection (2), are treated as pensionable pay,<\/blockquote>but does not include the amount of any such basic pay, allowances, emoluments or premium pay (or its equivalent) forgone under any salary sacrifice arrangement specifically approved by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the provision to that public servant of an exempt employee benefit.&quot;,<\/blockquote>and<br \/><br \/>(b) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (4):<blockquote>&quot;(5) In this section&mdash;<blockquote>'Act of 1997' means the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997;<br \/><br \/>'exempt employee benefit' means a benefit specifically approved by the Revenue Commissioners which is referred to in section 118B(2)(a)(i) or (iii) of the Act of 1997;<br \/><br \/>'salary sacrifice arrangement' has the same meaning as it has in section 118B of the Act of 1997.&quot;.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to ensure a salary sacrifice for employees under taxsaver schemes, such as the transport to work scheme and the cycle to work scheme, will not become liable for the new additional superannuation contribution.
