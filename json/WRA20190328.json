I am delighted that First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families commits to doubling investment over the next 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  Given the large amount of public money invested in these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. I believe that my Department's approach to protecting Exchequer funding and ensuring compliance, is balanced appropriately with supports we provide to services to enable them continue to deliver a sustainable and high quality service.<\/p>  <p>  Pobal, as administrator of my Department's funded childcare programmes, conducts compliance visits to childcare service providers. These visits check a service&rsquo;s compliance with the published rules of Exchequer funded programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show a significant level of non-compliance. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  In particular many childcare services have been found to be in breach of programme rules concerning attendance records and registrations. This issue has been particularly acute among services offering the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS).<\/p>  <p>  Non-compliance, like the type we have seen in CCS, represents a risk to Exchequer funds as it can lead to services receiving funding in excess of their entitlement. For this reason, my Department, working with Pobal, identify incorrect registrations and apply the relevant corrections to ensure that services are receiving the correct level of funding. <\/p>  <p>  The level of overclaim identified varies for each service and may impact some services more than others. Pobal has been working with services to explain the financial impacts and manage the overclaims recovery process. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise fully the challenges that can be faced by community services where incorrect registrations have been discovered. That is why my Department has developed a strong Case Management system, operated by Pobal, through which a dedicated team assists services facing challenges.<\/p>  <p>  This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Where financial difficulties or sustainability issues arise however, a budget I have created to assist with these challenges can then be tapped into to assist services transition, in a manageable way, towards sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged that the majority of services have engaged constructively with the process so far and a way forward has been found. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises. Again, I want to stress that expert assistance, and financial support is available to services who need it.<\/p>  <p>  The existing or legacy targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). The NCS was developed based on evidence of the best interests of children and families. Its attendance rules will reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. My Department has engaged with service providers on the development of the NCS and continues to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, rules will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how the NCS will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment.<\/p>  <p>  Turnover for many services has increased substantially due to the fact that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly and co-payments \/ top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families that I published last November. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800057#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800057#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[14496\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800057#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the fifth interim report of the Commission of Investigation into the Mother and Baby Homes will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>The Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) submitted a Fifth Interim Report to me on 15 March 2019. <\/p><p>I intend to seek formal Government approval to publish the report.

Funding of &euro;1.2 million (&euro;450,000 in 2018 and &euro;750,000 in 2019) was allocated under the Dormant Accounts Act, 2012. It facilitates the expansion of the research begun with the Greentown Study. It is intended to replicate this study in two other towns. Additionally, a national survey will be conducted to indicate how widespread the Greentown findings are. This will culminate in an expert-led intervention programme to be trialled next year.<\/p>  <p>  It is my hope that, through this research, we will be in a position to make robust interventions available to motivate and assist vulnerable children in danger of criminal influence and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800057#WRA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Data","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800057#WRA03600"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[14488\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800057#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children deemed to be at risk nationally; the extent to which support and attention is being made available to them; the level and quality of such support and its success to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that, at the end of December 2018, there were a total of 26,433 child protection cases open to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

The scheme will open to applications this October, with payments flowing from November.<\/p><p>As previously noted to the House, the provision of a timeline for the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme has always been dependent on having the necessary legal and ICT infrastructure in place.  Good progress is currently being made in this regard.<\/p><p>Last July, the primary legislation establishing the Scheme, the Childcare Support Act, was signed into law.  Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines made under the Act are now being finalised.  <\/p><p>Last July, I also awarded a contract for the development of the Scheme's supporting IT system.  The contractor, Codec, is currently working intensively with officials from my Department and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system so that it will be available on schedule in October. <\/p><p>In December, I signed regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services with Tusla, and these regulations came into force on the 18<sup>th<\/sup>of February. This means that school age childcare services will be able to participate in the scheme from the outset. <\/p><p>A national communications campaign on the Scheme is also underway.  This involves a sequenced programme of information, training and supports, to allow everyone- parents, providers and representative groups- to prepare for the Scheme.  Key elements of the campaign in March included the launch of a new website- - as well as a major nationwide training programme for providers, offering over 12,500 training places across 600 venues.  I am happy to report that there is very strong interest in both the website and the training. <\/p><p>In September and October, my Department will run a large information campaign across a number of media channels to ensure there is full awareness amongst parents of their potential entitlements under the new Scheme.<\/p><p>In the interim, in order to fast-track many of the benefits of the National Childcare Scheme, and to ensure all Government investment was being fully utilised, in September 2017 I announced a series of enhancements to the existing targeted childcare subsidy schemes.  These enhancements involved a new universal subsidy for children under 3 years and increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates.  The interim measures exceeded our target and benefitted 84,000 children in the programme year September 2017- August 2018. These measures remain in place for the 2018 \/2019 programme year and continue to experience high demand.<\/p><p>As stated above, the National Childcare Scheme is due to go live this October. As part of Budget 2019, I was pleased to have been able to further enhance the Scheme by raising the upper and lower thresholds for income related subsidies.  These increases will poverty-proof the scheme for families on lower incomes, and enable more families with middle and higher incomes to access support. <\/p><p>I continue to work intensively with my officials to deliver this landmark scheme which will alter the landscape of early learning and care and school age childcare in Ireland, support families, provide a sustainable platform for investment and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. <\/p><p>In parallel with this work, I will continue to support providers with regard to increased provision of early learning and care and school age childcare places. In 2019, I have secured a capital budget of &euro;9.606m for the sector which will enable a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting the transition of services to the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. <\/p><p>I am also very pleased to have ensured that childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan ( 2018-2027) and to have secured &euro;250m in capital funding for early learning and care and school age childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.<\/p><p>This capital investment will be essential, I believe, to respond to the increased demand we expect as the National Childcare Scheme is introduced. Research is on-going in my Department to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years. <\/p><p>Finally, many families and children opt for home-based rather than centre-based early learning and care and school age childcare. Continued access to childminding services is important. I will soon publish a Childminding Action Plan which will set out short, medium and long term objectives to regulate childminding in this country, hence enabling a larger volume of childminders access the NCS over time. This action plan will also set out the supports required to enable childminders meet the regulatory requirements that will be developed over an extended period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Programmes","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[14497\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that some parents that are availing of the ECCE scheme are being charged for a fourth hour even if they are not using the facility for a fourth hour in view of the fact the facility is open for four hours; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>The ECCE programme is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range.

These are available on a national basis through thousands of registered providers across all counties, including Wexford. They include:<\/p><p>-  The universal pre-school programme, which provides children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year. Since September 2018 children qualify for two years of universal pre-school.<\/p><p>-The universal Community Childcare Subvention (CCSU) and the targeted Community Childhood Subvention (CCS), which provide weekly subsidies to offset fees charged by providers. CCS is available to families who hold a Medical Card or are in receipt of social welfare benefits.<\/p><p>-  The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes provide a weekly subsidy to offset fees charged by providers for parents on approved education or training courses, Community Employment schemes, or those returning to work who need school-age childcare.<\/p><p>-  Specific supports are also in place for children in emergency accommodation, in accommodation centres provided by the State for persons in the protection process or programme refugee children in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.<\/p><p>Radical reforms to the targeted schemes, based on the principle of progressive universalism, are in train. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced this October, will replace the CCS and TEC schemes with a single, streamlined scheme. <\/p><p>Under the NCS, parents will continue to have access to the universal subsidy towards the cost of Early Learning and Care. This stands at &euro;1,040 per annum currently for a child under 3 in full time registered Early Learning and Care. Targeted subsidies for children from 6 months to 15 years of age will be provided, with the level of subsidy determined by net household income and the age of the child (children). Households with a net income of less than &euro;26,000 will receive the maximum subsidy. This can be as high as &euro;5.10 per hour, available for up to 40 hours per week, for a child under one. Households with net income up to &euro;60,000 will also benefit, but on a sliding scale from the maximum subsidy level available for incomes under &euro;26,000. Further information is available at . <\/p><p>In addition to these universal and targeted subsidies, the NCS allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for Early Learning and Care on grounds of child development or child welfare. Families with high levels of need, who require Early Learning and Care for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.  Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements. <\/p><p>Recent analysis undertaken by the OECD has concluded that, when the NCS is introduced, the costs of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to parents will come closer to the OECD average &ndash; from being one of the highest across the OECD.  For example, we will move from being the most expensive country in the OECD for lone parents to 11th position ( this research was conducted before Budget 2019 which increased investment by a further &euro;89m). This demonstrates significant progress. The NCS, in creating a flexible platform for future investment in funding, will allow subsidies to be expanded over time and importantly further progress to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[14492\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the way in which and when she received correspondence that Tusla sent to an organisation (details supplied) on 18 February 2019 in respect of ongoing safeguarding concerns.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>In the afternoon of Monday 25th February, during a telephone call on another matter, Mr Ian Elliott advised an official of my Department of the existence of the letter from Tusla (dated 18th February) and of his discussion about this earlier that day (25th February) with two officials of Tusla and with senior Garda&iacute;.

The scheme will open to applications this October, with payments flowing from November.<\/p><p>Good progress is currently being made in preparing for the Scheme's launch.<\/p><p>Last July, the primary legislation establishing the Scheme, the Childcare Support Act, was signed into law.  Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines made under the Act are now being finalised.  <\/p><p>Last July, I also awarded a contract for the development of the Scheme's supporting IT system.  The contractor, Codec, is currently working intensively with officials from my Department and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system so that it will be available on schedule in October. <\/p><p>In December, I signed regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services with Tusla, and these regulations came into force on the 18<sup>th<\/sup>of February. This means that school age childcare services will be able to participate in the scheme from the outset. <\/p><p>A national communications campaign on the Scheme is also underway.  This involves a sequenced programme of information, training and supports, to allow everyone- parents, providers and representative groups- to prepare for the Scheme.  Key elements of the campaign in March included the launch of a new website- - as well as a major nationwide training programme for providers, offering over 12,500 training places across 600 venues.  I am happy to report that there is very strong interest in both the website and the training. <\/p><p>In September and October, my Department will run a large information campaign across a number of media channels to ensure there is full awareness amongst parents of their potential entitlements under the new Scheme.<\/p><p>Under measures included in Budget 2019, I was pleased to have been able to further enhance the Scheme by raising the upper and lower thresholds for income related subsidies.  These increases will poverty-proof the scheme for families on lower incomes, and enable more families with middle and higher incomes to access support. <\/p><p>I will continue to work intensively to deliver this landmark scheme which will alter the landscape of childcare in Ireland, support families, provide a sustainable platform for investment and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. <\/p><p>In parallel with this work, I will continue to support providers with regard to increased provision of childcare places. In 2019, I have secured a Capital budget of &euro;9.606m for the sector which will enable a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting the transition of services to the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. <\/p><p>I am also very pleased to have ensured that childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan ( 2018-2027) and to have secured &euro;250m in capital funding for childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the earlier National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.  This investment will be essential, I believe, to respond to the increased capacity we expect as the new National Childcare Scheme is introduced.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Investigations","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[14279\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the serious difficulties facing Tusla; the number of child protection notifications yet to be investigated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to set out the immense work that Tusla has undertaken since its establishment, the ongoing challenges it is facing and the immediate and longer term actions being put in place as I speak. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla was established in 2014 with the task of bringing together 17 child protection service areas across the country, to operate as one Agency. It must be remembered that the different areas, although all in the HSE, had continued in reality to operate different practices and policies, reflecting their different health board origins.  Tusla's task was to reform the 17 areas into  a single organisation with new management structures, bring together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, (the HSE, the Family support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board)  develop  national operational policies and realign the new organisation to current need. All of this had to occur while providing the ongoing complex business of child protection services in the face of  increasing referrals. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has been engaged in a programme of reform  which involves the standardisation of business processes, the development of quality assurance mechanisms and improved data system to reflect service demand, outputs and outcomes.  A National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) was rolled out to all 17 Tusla areas in July 2017.  The NCCIS is producing high quality data and making child protection services more effective. Tusla has also implemented a national model for child protection, Signs of Safety, and, through its own auditing work, identifies practices that need improvement.  Tusla now has common definitions and thresholds for child protection cases,  which, for the first time, provide a true picture of children's need in our country. Knowing where the problems lie is an essential step in delivering improvements. <\/p>  <p>  A major issue for the organisation since its establishment has been achieving a sufficient number of social workers to meet the ongoing rise in referrals for child protection and child welfare services.  Tusla are finalising a Workforce Strategy to focus on future need to ensure they are in a position to address their statutory work. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA have rightly identified issues in relation to retrospective cases and safety planning that need to be addressed in their Statutory Investigation published last summer. I established an Expert Advisory Group to advise me and the Board of Tusla on the progress that was being made in implementing actions.  I met with the Chairperson of the EAG, Dr Moling Ryan, on Monday last and he provided me with a report identifying progress and areas needing further prioritising.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials are currently working with the education sector, including the five Universities and one Institute of Technology involved in qualifying social workers. The purpose of the work is to increase the  future provision of social workers. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also asks about the number of child protection and welfare referrals that have yet to be assessed.  At the end of December 2018, over 6,000 cases were unallocated, representing 23% of all cases. All  high-risk or urgent referrals do receive an immediate service and urgent response. Tusla has identified 5 of the 17 areas  that between them hold the majority of unallocated cases. I have asked Tusla to make a presentation to me on the special measures it is putting in place in these areas to manage this worrying situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":79,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":80,"content":"<p>Question No. 38 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":81,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 39 and 40 answered with Question No. 35.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB04000"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[14490\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800058#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of times she has met with senior management of Tusla since January 2019; and the subjects of discussion at those meetings.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>I have met with members of the Tusla, the Child and Family Agency Senior Management team on two occasions since the beginning of January 2019.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.   <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800059#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800059#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[14547\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800059#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners will consider a refund of VRT in which the value of the vehicle in real terms is lower than the rate applied by them; the situations in which the Revenue Commissioners will consider a refund of VRT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that any person who pays Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) but considers the amount charged to be excessive has two appeal options.

I am not in a position to comment on individual cases, and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the pricing or provision of insurance products, as these are matters of a commercial nature, and determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.    <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016 that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.  This Working Group, now chaired by the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., has undertaken an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  The Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent Progress Update was published last week and shows that 24 out of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been accomplished.

Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, credit intermediaries are authorised by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and when performing intermediary functions credit intermediaries are required to disclose certain information in writing to the consumer including the nature of the financial accommodation and details on the amount, number and frequency of payments, the total amount the consumer would have to pay under the agreement and, where applicable, the APR. <\/p>  <p>  While intermediaries are frequently involved in the process, hire purchase agreements are ultimately provided by hire purchase providers and these providers are the entity which is the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the good let to the consumer under the hire purchase agreement.  While hire-purchase providers themselves are not required to obtain a specific authorisation from the Central Bank (or the CCPC) for the provision of hire-purchase agreements, nevertheless this is an activity which is subject to statutory control and which contains important consumer protections.  For example, Parts II and VI of the Consumer Credit Act provide that important information be disclosed in advertisements for hire purchase agreements and also in such agreements as entered into by consumers.  This includes information on the cash price of the good, as well as the APR and hire purchase price. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the regulatory framework governing the provision of PCP and hire purchase agreements is kept under review to ensure that the level of consumer protection continues to be robust. Following reports on the PCP market by the CCPC and the Central Bank, last summer I asked Mr. Michael Tutty to conduct a review of the PCP market and regulatory structure and his report was subsequently published by my Department last November.  That report found that there was currently no evidence of consumer detriment arising from PCPs but nevertheless it set out a number of recommendations to help avoid possible problems arising in the future. The CCPC and Tutty Reports suggested that it would be desirable to ensure that certain provisions of the Consumer Protection Code (CPC) , in particular the relevant provisions on &ldquo;knowing the consumer and suitability&rdquo; should be applicable to PCP and hire purchase agreements and that the appropriate legal means of doing so should be investigated further. I have previously indicated that I broadly accept the recommendations and conclusions of the Tutty report and my Department is currently consulting the Office of the Attorney General on some specific issues raised in the report (including those in relation to the CPC). When a response is to hand, my Department will further engage with the Central Bank, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the CCPC on this matter. Also, in relation to the requirement to check the financial position of the consumer before he\/she may enter into a PCP or hire purchase agreement, as the Deputy will be aware the Markets in Financial Instruments Act 2018 now provides that hire purchase and similar type agreements now fall within the scope of the Central Credit Register. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to enhance the level of public awareness of PCP products and to provide information in relation to financial services more generally, including information in relation to the costs to consumers and the risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services. In this context the CCPC has conducted several awareness campaigns in relation to PCP car finance in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and I am advised that it is developing a further campaign for 2019. I am informed that part of the CCPC&rsquo;s information campaigns relates to the implications of a poor credit rating on future financial requirements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800059#WRC04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Costs","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800059#WRC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[14624\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800059#WRC05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the body that will be liable for the losses in a case (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding that the Government profoundly disagrees with the Commission's analysis in the Apple State aid case, the full recovery of the alleged State aid from Apple has been completed with approximately &euro;14.3 billion deposited into the Escrow Fund.

However, they note that not all undertakings with passporting notifications write business in Ireland.  In this regard, they advise that 64 UK insurance undertakings and 17 Gibraltar insurance undertakings currently have Irish policyholders.

Currently, the only public information available in relation to awards are those settled by PIAB, and those awarded in Court. However what percentage these settlement channels make up of overall award levels, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was not able to establish.  In its report on the cost of motor insurance, the CIWG indicated as follows &ldquo;Claims details in relation to direct settlements between insurers and claimants are not publically available. Some commentators estimate that direct settlement comprise 60%-70% of all cases thus this represents a significant data gap&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the CIWG recommended that such information be collected as part of the National Claims Information Database.  One of the key purposes of collecting claims data by settlement channels is to give greater insight into how costs and awards differ depending on the method of settlement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas recently passed the legislation to provide relevant powers to the Central Bank of Ireland to establish the National Claims Information Database.  Section 4 of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 sets out the different settlement channels through which a claim may be finalised.  The breakdown of the various channels in the Section was identified as important to allow policymakers to see trends or distinctions in the costs related to these channels and to enable them develop more targeted response measures where necessary.  This information is expected to include motor insurance claims information in respect of the last 10 years, including the number of claims reported and settled, the amounts paid on claims, the incurred cost on claims (i.e. the amount paid plus the outstanding amount to be paid, if any), and the actuarial estimate of the final cost of claims i.e. ultimate costs.   <\/p>  <p>  The Act was commenced by the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. 2 of 2019) on Monday 28 January 2019.  The required consultation by the Central Bank with regard to the publication of the relevant regulations to outline the scope of the Database took place in mid-March and I understand that the Bank is finalising arrangements to publish these regulations.  The Central Bank plans to collect motor claims data from insurance undertakings in the first half of 2019, with a view to publishing its first annual report under the legislation in the second half of the year.  The Central Bank will also as the Deputy is aware consider the feasibility of expanding the scope of the database to cover employer\/public liability later this year. <\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I believe that increasing transparency in and around the settlement channels is a key part of claims information, and having this information will allow policymakers have a better understanding of the way the market is evolving and thus enable them better identify and take action to address  trends in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stability Programme Update","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD02800"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[14692\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he plans to publish the stability programme update; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>The draft Stability Programme Update 2019 (SPU) will be published in mid-April. <\/p><p>In accordance with the requirements of the European Semester, the final SPU will be submitted to the European Commission by 30<sup>th<\/sup>April 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[14693\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an analysis has been undertaken on the potential cost of establishing a public insurance body to provide insurance for flooding to persons who are unable to obtain flood insurance similar to the model in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance carried out a review of policy in relation to flood insurance in 2016, which formed part of the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group Interim Report, as approved by Government in November 2016.  As part of the review, the Department examined a number of possible approaches including approaches in other jurisdictions. This work included examination of an insurance pool option which would involve setting up an insurance pool financed by an agreed percentage of insurance premiums being paid into it similar to Flood Re in the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  The first point to note is that the Flood Re model is basically an insurance scheme underwritten and administered by the industry which the UK Government helped establish. My Department has had some discussions, with the Irish insurance industry about an equivalent arrangement and they have made it very clear that they do not think it is feasible in an Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  In addition it was concluded that even if industry were willing to participate, the State would have to be prepared to provide financial support in circumstances where the claims were above the level covered by the pool as it is unlikely that there would be sufficient capacity in the Irish reinsurance market to cover this extra amount. This is unlike Flood Re which uses a reinsurance backstop which is facilitated by the fact that there is a liquid reinsurance market in the UK.  It is important to note also that certain significant exclusions apply in the UK scheme, such as small businesses and houses built after 2009.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the Department&rsquo;s review concluded that the approach of an Insurance Pool with State indemnification would lead to additional levies being imposed on all household insurance policies at a time of increasing insurance costs, and could potentially lead to a considerable financial exposure to the State in the form of a State backstop. <\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to believe that its existing policy and investment in relation to flooding which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme by the OPW and Local Authorities, complemented by the exchange of information with the insurance industry on completed flood defence schemes.  This approach should lead to the increased availability of and lower cost for flood insurance and further improve the already high level of coverage in this country compared with many other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[14694\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if expenditure on health and safety equipment by a company qualifies for capital allowances; the rules regarding capital allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a company may claim capital allowances on capital expenditure, which it incurs on plant and machinery, at a rate of 12.5% per year over 8 years. <\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for capital allowances, the plant and machinery must be in use at the end of the company&rsquo;s accounting period and in use for the purposes of its trade. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to health and safety equipment, equipment such as fire alarms, hose reels and hoses, fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems and smoke detectors would qualify as plant.

From that engagement, I understand that neither body are aware of any models in other jurisdictions by which companies that are unable to obtain an insurance quote can avail of insurance similar to the Declined Cases Agreement.  The Bank has also advised that there is no formal cross-European mechanism in place to deal with these situations.    <\/p>  <p>  In addition, we are not aware of any public insurance models used in other European jurisdictions.  It should also be noted in this regard that any public insurance model, if it existed, would have to comply with the same prudential rules as apply to private insurers, namely the Solvency II Directive.  Therefore, in such a scenario the public insurer&rsquo;s consideration about providing a particular type of cover and the price to offer it are unlikely to be significantly different to that of a private insurer.       <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that unlike third party motor insurance, employer and public liability insurance is not a compulsory requirement in Ireland.  Consequently, there is no equivalent arrangement in Ireland to the Declined Cases Agreement which operates at an industry level to ensure no motorists are unable to secure the third party motor insurance that they are legally required to hold to operate a motor vehicle.  Such a proposal, if put in place, would in effect be a direct intervention by the State to force insurance companies to take on risk that they would not otherwise be willing to accept.  A consequence of this is that they would price such risk at what they consider an appropriate level which almost certainly would be prohibitively expensive.  It would not be possible in such circumstances for the Minister for Finance to direct that such cover be applied at lower levels, as neither he nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.  Another difficulty with such a proposal is that insurers generally operate in niche areas of the business market based on their risk appetite and their understanding of these areas.  Therefore, forcing companies to take on risks outside of their expertise may result in them leaving the market and it may also discourage new entrants to the Irish market. On this basis, I believe such a proposal could be counterproductive over the longer term.    <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Government is acutely aware of the difficulties that the cost and availability of liability insurance is having on businesses across the country and every effort is being made to implement the recommendations of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report in order to address the awards level differential between this country and England and Wales.  It is hoped that once this is done, there should be a significant positive impact on pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD04400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Refurbishment","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[14579\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800060#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the refurbishment and building works that will take place at Drogheda Garda station in 2019; the cost of the programme of works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>The Capital Investment Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS)  2016 -2021, includes for the provision of a Property Exhibits Management Store (PEMS) at Drogheda Garda Station.

It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned.

We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead. <\/p><p>The table below outlines the number of IDA site visits to Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford in each year since 2012.<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork <\/td><td>38<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>51<\/td><td>61<\/td><td>308<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>196<\/td><td>180<\/td><td>205<\/td><td>242<\/td><td>284<\/td><td>327<\/td><td>269<\/td><td>1703<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td>18<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>251<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>241<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>131<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800061#WRE05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800061#WRE05400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800061#WRE05300"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[14534\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800061#WRE05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800061#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Definitions","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800062#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[14535\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800062#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of plans to recognise a condition (details supplied) as a disability; if his attention has been drawn to the distress and suffering caused as a result of the condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>Fibromyalgia is a syndrome associated with wide-spread pain and fatigue.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<ol type=\"1\"><li>the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/li><li>an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/li><\/ol>This report has been completed and was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. <\/p><p>The Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including: <\/p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials; <\/p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures; <\/p><p>- the development of clinical guidance; <\/p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices; <\/p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and <\/p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented. <\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. <\/p><p>The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  The HSE has  published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource.

It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan. <\/p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800063#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Review","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800063#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[14593\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800063#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when new arrangements will be introduced and if legislation is required regarding changes to the rules for the fair deal scheme in order to introduce a three-year cap on the inclusion of productive assets in the assessment of or as part of the scheme in view of the fact that the matter is ongoing for some time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>The proposed policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), to cap contributions based on farm assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government.

In parallel, my Department is also working on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, which in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals, will recognise that greater environmental and climate ambition is required.   <\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, my Department continues to review options that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy.  The recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of measures we need to implement to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector.  My Department&rsquo;s approach is to focus on driving down the emissions intensity of Irish production through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the practical application of emerging scientific knowledge.    <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2019 that he intends to put in place a long-term trajectory for Carbon Tax increases out to 2030, in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action.   <\/p>  <p>  I continue to liaise with colleagues across Government on policy approaches to climate action, in particular on the development of a new &ldquo;All of Government Climate Plan&rdquo; led by my colleague Minister Bruton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800064#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Usage","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800064#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[14635\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800064#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the exceptional circumstances in the case of a person (details supplied) will be considered; if the ongoing mental health issues will be considered based on the medical report submitted; if the issue will be positively disposed of; and if he will expedite the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>There is currently an open review case in relation to this person regarding a breach of the nitrates regulations (2017).

During the discussion on the meat market, I outlined the exposure of the Irish beef sector in particular and called for the full suite of measures available under the Common Market Organisation, including targeted support for farmers, to be deployed rapidly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I also referred to the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur, against the background of the significant uncertainty arising from Brexit.  I also highlighted the exposure of the Irish fisheries sector, and the need for careful joint EU management of fisheries resources, as well as financial supports for fishermen and their communities.   <\/p>  <p>  The Slovenian delegation presented a point of information under any other business to highlight the importance and uncertainty of small-scale fisheries in the context of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a new, post 2020, European and Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).

The Parliament's proposed amendment was to include the alignment of Derry - Sligo - Galway on the North Sea - Mediterranean Core Network Corridor. This amendment was deemed unacceptable by the European Commission on the grounds that alignments of the core network corridors can only include elements of the core TEN-T network, which as presently defined does not include any of Derry, Sligo or Galway. A number of similar proposed amendments by the Parliament concerning other Member States were also rejected on the same grounds.<\/p>  <p>  In late February 2019, my Department received correspondence from European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, which stated that the European Commission is considering advancing the review of the comprehensive TEN-T Network, which is due to take place no later than the end of 2023, as stipulated in the TEN-T Regulation. The Commission's review process will include: an evaluation study, to be launched this month and to conclude in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation process, opening this month and concluding in June 2019; and targeted consultation with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders, commencing in the second half of 2019.

Phase 1 involved the reopening of the 36 mile stretch of railway line between Ennis and Athenry and this is part of the TEN-T comprehensive network.  This line was opened to the public in March 2010.  Exchequer funding of &euro;106.5 million was approved for Phase 1.<\/p>  <p>  The plan for Phase 2 involved the development of the line from Athenry to Tuam.

Having conducted a procurement process for contracts of this nature, Irish Rail anticipate the appointed consultants will commence work at the end of the month.

An eligible child is defined as a child aged 16 years or over who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18. An eligible adult is defined as a person aged 18, 19 or 20 (inclusive) who was in the care of the State for at least 12 months between the ages of 13 and 18.<\/p><p>When confirmed eligible, an assessment of need will be undertaken jointly by the child&rsquo;s social worker and after care service within four months, or six months prior to their 18<sup>th<\/sup>birthday. The aftercare plan will be determined by each young person&rsquo;s assessment of need. <\/p><p>The assessment of need determines the level of support which the young person will require as part of an aftercare plan. It encompasses all categories of need including, at a minimum:<\/p><p>- Education<\/p><p>- Financing and budgeting matters<\/p><p>- Training and employment<\/p><p>- Health and wellbeing<\/p><p>- Personal and  social development<\/p><p>- Accommodation.<\/p><p>- Family\/emotional support <\/p><p>The assessment of need will determine whether the young person requires an allocated aftercare worker.<\/p><p>Following the assessment of need Tusla will prepare an aftercare plan, if required.  An aftercare plan is a written plan that is prepared by the aftercare worker and the young person in conjunction with their social worker and other key people in their lives. These plans can be reviewed at the request of the young person or a person acting on their behalf. <\/p><p>Tusla reports in Q3 2018 that almost half of young people, aged 18 to 22, remained living with their  former foster carers.  This indicates a strong support in the transition for these young people. <\/p><p>Aftercare services provided by Tusla include:<\/p><p>- An allocated aftercare worker from the age of 17 years up to the age of 21 years and up to 23 years if in education\/ training (depending on the assessment of need)<\/p><p>- A drop-in service - which will provide advice guidance, support and signposting when required to all young people eligible for aftercare provision.<\/p><p>- Financial support based on a financial needs assessment and eligibility for those in education or accredited training up to the age of 21 years, or until completion of their course of education up to the age of 23 years.<\/p><p>- Tusla provide a young person in aftercare in education or training  with an allowance of &euro;300 per week.<\/p><p>Other financial benefits<\/p><p>- Young people in aftercare are also eligible for the higher SUSI grant.  Unemployed young people in aftercare are eligible for the over 25 year old rate of unemployment benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800066#WRK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800066#WRK04400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comhairle na Tuaithe","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800066#WRK04300"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[14552\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800066#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the reason Comhairle na Tuaithe has not met since the middle of 2018; his plans to reconvene same; and his views on the role of the advisory body.","asker":"1253","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department was established on 19th July 2017.

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.<\/p>  <p>  Wherever possible reviews will be processed using information already held by my Department.  In some cases additional information is being requested to ensure people receives the best rate possible.  Approximately 25,000 requests for information have issued to date.  It is important that prompt responses are received to those requests so that the reviews can be completed as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Reviews commenced from 13 February 2019, the day after I signed the necessary regulations which together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made.

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The rent contribution agreement stipulates that \"the HAP claimant acknowledges that the Local Authority will immediately suspend or cease making the Housing Assistance Payment to the landlord on behalf of the HAP Claimant in respect of the tenancy at the Property.  Upon the Local Authority ceasing to make the Housing Assistance Payment the HAP Claimant shall immediately become liable for all and any rent payable to the landlord.\" In practice, however, suspension would not normally take immediate effect and engagement with the tenant is initiated.   <\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from issuing the formal notification letters, there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process. Depending on the particular arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and\/ or cessation of the HAP payment.  However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord. <\/p>  <p>  If the tenant does not contact their local authority or does not enter into a payment arrangement within 8 weeks of the arrears commencing, both the landlord and the tenant are informed that the HAP payment may be ceased.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that the practice of the SSC is appropriate, measured and effective and that local authorities, as housing authorities, have the expertise and resources to discharge their responsibilities towards social housing households including consideration of changed financial positions for households in HAP. There is no requirement for guidance from my Department to be issued regarding implementation of the debt collection process which is a matter for Local Authorities and the SSC operating on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the average time in, and amount of, arrears outstanding at the time of cessation, the SSC advise that this information is not readily available from their system as they operate from a live system. They have not historically extracted specific information at the exact point at which the tenancy is ceased and what the balance is at that point in time. Information is only recorded on the current balance which will more than likely have changed since the tenancy was ceased if a write off of the amount outstanding had been approved or if the tenant began to pay off the arrears. <\/p>  <p>  To date, the approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2018, the scheme had a 98% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. Since HAP was rolled out in 2014 to end 2018, HAP support has been ceased for 665 tenancies due to tenant differential rent arrears. This represents 1.2% of all tenancies set up during that period.<\/p>  <p>  Tenancy sustainment is a very important factor in relation to keeping households in their homes. This is why the SSC operate, on behalf of the 31 local authorities, a graduated approach to cessation rather than the immediate cessation outlined in the rent contribution agreement. There are a number of avenues for a tenant experiencing financial difficulty including early engagement with the relevant local authority or the Community Welfare Officer. Notwithstanding the assistance available to tenants, there is a fundamental need for a tenant to acknowledge and make the maximum effort to fulfil their personal responsibilities and requirements in relation to contributing to their accommodation costs and to engage early when difficulties arise. The rent contribution that a household is asked to pay is calculated by the local authority having regard to the financial circumstances of the household and affordability. The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of the contributions from households and exchequer funding, so it is absolutely critical that additional unnecessary burden is not placed on the exchequer to offset non-payment of differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  As the HAP scheme grows, the SSC are continuously working to improve systems and processes, including debt management processes. My Department, with the assistance of stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, HAP Practitioners from local authorities and also the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, will continue to work with the SSC to ensure that the debt management process is reasonable and effective and that the appropriate tenancy sustainment options are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800068#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Rents","counter":584,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800068#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":585,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[14586\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019032800068#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if it is standard practice for local councils to postpone rent reviews for a decade or more, leading to large increases in rent in cases in which the postponed review does take place as in the case of County Longford; his views on whether this is best practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":586,"content":"<p>The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of housing authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to guidelines issued from time to time by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Rent reviews are also a matter for individual housing authorities.

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental can make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  <\/p>  <p>  To support the introduction of affordable housing, including cost rental, the Government has made &euro;310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure, under the Serviced Sites Fund, over the next three years.  <\/p>  <p>  Two path-finder cost rental projects are currently being progressed. Firstly, the Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and two Approved Housing Bodies (Respond and T&uacute;ath) are working on a project at the Enniskerry Road, Dublin, which will deliver 50 cost rental homes. This project is providing very valuable learning and is helping to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects. Planning permission is currently in place and tenders have been assessed. An application submitted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund last year in relation to the project was successful. It is anticipated that construction will commence on this project in the second quarter of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The second project, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Emmet Road in Inchicore, is estimated to have the potential to accommodate circa. 470 homes in a high quality development.  The current tenure mix as agreed with by my Department is 30% Social and 70% Cost Rental.  It is expected that the procurement process for the design team will get underway in Q2 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated by the National Development Finance Agency that rents of between 15-25% below market are achievable.
