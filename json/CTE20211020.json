I am a member of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and I am joined by Mr. Patrick Kenny, another member of the CCPC.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC has a statutory function under the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 to promote competition and promote and protect the interests and welfare of consumers.  In the pursuit of those functions, we enforce competition and consumer protection law.  We also provide advice to the Government and other public bodies on issues relating to competition and consumer welfare.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC is concerned that the provisions contained in this Bill would be disproportionate and would, in the CCPC's view, lead to a restriction of competition in the market for veterinary services with negative consequences for consumers, including farmers and the wider agricultural sector.  Any perceived benefits of the proposed legislation are, in our view, unquantified and unclear.  The CCPC is concerned also about potential unintended consequences of the proposed legislation, should it be enacted.<\/p> <p>  Directive 2006\/123\/EC, commonly referred to as the services directive, is intended to provide a level playing field and eliminate barriers to the provision of services by businesses and professionals across the member states of the European Union.  The services directive requires that any legal restrictions on the exercise of a service are permissible only where they comply with the principles of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality.  Any restrictions on the legal form that veterinary practices take should be justified on a clear evidential basis of protecting the public from detriment, including harm to the animals under the care of veterinary practitioners.  The CCPC is of the view that there is a real risk that an outright ban on corporate ownership could be successfully challenged as being disproportionate.  The proposed legislation could be at odds with efforts to ensure Ireland remains in compliance with EU law and continues to be a welcoming location for new businesses and investment by service providers.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC believes the committee should consider the adverse implications of the legislation on existing corporate-owned practices in the State as well as their employees and customers.  As the members of the committee are aware, the Constitution extends certain rights, including property rights, which may be affected by the passage of the Bill into law.  The role of interpreting the Constitution falls to the courts.  As such, I will focus our comments in the remainder of this statement to the CCPC's views on the impact of the Bill on competition and the disproportionality of introducing a ban on corporate ownership.  It is the CCPC's view that enhanced regulation could instead be employed to ensure veterinary practices continue to provide a high standard of care, irrespective of ownership structure.<\/p> <p>  Competition policy in its broadest sense involves the enforcement of competition law, including rules against anticompetitive practices, merger rules and, in addition, public policy measures that enable and support competition in markets.  It may be of assistance to the committee if I briefly discuss the importance of the public policy aspects of competition policy to the functioning of the economy.  These aspects of the CCPC's remit focus on the broader environment of legislation, regulation and administrative practices.<\/p> <p>  Public policy can give rise to restrictions on competition in a number of ways.  The CCPC recognises that there can be legitimate public policy objectives which, when balanced against those of competition, can lead to less competition in a market but which promote the public good in a broader sense.  For example, the high level of qualifications necessary to practise medicine and veterinary medicine are barriers to entry but the vital importance of protecting human and animal health justify those requirements.<\/p> <p>  Some restrictions, however, are less open to objective justification.  The CCPC and its predecessor agency, the Competition Authority, have engaged with government and other stakeholders in order to reduce such restrictions over the past number of decades through our advocacy activity and, in particular, through our market studies.  Examples include our recommendations and advocacy activity to open the market for legal services to greater competition and to reduce restrictions on the availability of GP services in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The committee may be aware that the Competition Authority published a study of the veterinarian market in 2008.  That study found a number of unnecessary restrictions on competition between vets.  It made a number of recommendations intended to address those restrictions, including removing restrictions on advertising by vets.  The Competition Authority also examined ways of ensuring an adequate supply of veterinary services in the future, which is of particular importance for the agricultural sector.  We note the increased number of vets in practice in Ireland since the publication of the study.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC understands that the intent of the Bill is to prohibit corporate ownership of veterinary practices by non-vets.<\/p><p>However, the CCPC believes that a variety of types of veterinary practices, including incorporated practices, should have a role to play in this sector.  This was a specific recommendation in the competition authority&rsquo;s study as it found that the benefits of corporate ownership included improved access to capital for investment and the greater application of non-veterinary business skills.  There are further potential benefits, including cost savings, the ability to provide locations and opening hours that are more convenient for many consumers and flexible working arrangements.  The current Irish veterinary sector is similar to many other European countries, in that there are a variety of types of ownership of practices.  Veterinarians may work as sole traders, in partnerships, in incorporated practices and as employees.  Survey results published by the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe in 2018 indicate that the Irish veterinary sector is not unusual in having a range of ownership models.  Small practices predominate in Europe with almost half of veterinarians being sole traders.  In contrast, Ireland is home to a higher than average number of medium-sized and larger practices with approximately 40% being incorporated in some form.  It would appear that irrespective of practice type, vets continue to deliver a variety of vital services across European countries. <\/p><p> The CCPC&rsquo;s view is that the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 could instead be amended to provide a legal basis on which the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI, can regulate the operation of incorporated practices.  As members will be aware, veterinary practitioners are obliged by provisions in the Veterinary Practice Act, as well as the VCI&rsquo;s code of conduct, as to how they perform their functions in respect of their clients and animals under care.  As set out in the code of conduct the veterinarian&rsquo;s duty to his or her clients includes the provision of 24-hour emergency cover for the care of animals that during normal working hours could be considered as being under the care of the veterinary practice.  We understand that the intention of the Bill is in part to ensure that the availability of critical veterinary services, such as the provision of 24-hour care, is not reduced due to such services being incompatible with the priorities of management in a corporate owned practice.  However such a ban would appear to be unique in Europe and has not been applied in other similar professions such as GPs, pharmacies and dentists.  <\/p><p> It would be difficult to predict the effects of such a drastic measure on the current veterinary sector and we have not seen evidence that this analysis has been done.  The CCPC instead suggests that proportionate regulation could provide reassurance for consumers including those in the agricultural sectors, that veterinarians employed by corporate owned practices would continue to deliver such services as part of a regulated obligation on the practice.  The CCPC is aware for example, that the Pharmacy Act 2007, and subsequent regulations made under that Act, impose obligations on the owners of retail pharmacies, including where that pharmacy owner is a corporate body.  This approach ensures the benefits of corporate ownership can be realised for pharmacies, while maintaining a high standard of clinical care and compliance with the law. <\/p><p> The CCPC considers that there is an opportunity to reassess how regulation of veterinary services can remain responsive to changes in the market, while ensuring that restrictions on entry into that market are proportionate.  To that end we suggest that consideration be given to engagement with the VCI and the wider veterinary sector to establish how regulation can be developed, while ensuring that the market remains open to new entry and innovation and continues to protect the interests of consumers and animals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian McHugh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McHugh for that comprehensive opening statement.

The commission has made submissions on similar legislation in the past and there are some inconsistencies in what we heard today with what the commission said on previous occasions in regard to legislation.  I will point to a couple of law points.  One relates to competition law of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, which states that the ECJ has held that competitive restrictions resulting from acts of professionally regulated bodies do not fall within the scope of EU competition law where such restrictions are necessary and proportionate to the regulation of a profession.  This amending legislation has three main purposes.  The first is to prevent laypersons, non-professional corporates from illegally practising veterinary medicine through the purchase and operation of veterinary practices in Ireland.  The second is to ensure that the practice of veterinary medicine remains within the regulatory compass of the Veterinary Council of Ireland as the VCI has no regulatory control over lay operators.  The third and most important purpose is to protect the consumer, animal health and welfare and public health.  That is paramount.<\/p> <p>  Allowing an unregistered person to own a veterinary practice would mean an unregistered person or body corporate would enjoy a level of control over substantive practice-related decisions, for example, the policy of the veterinary practice including practice protocols, the mix of work accepted and performed in the practice, the materials employed by practitioners in the practice, and the sale and supply of prescription drugs in direct contravention of the animal remedies regulations, section 28(4) together with Schedule 1, Part 1, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.  In lay terms what that means is that we have lay people purchasing and having the control of drugs.  <\/p> <p>  This committee has spent much time in the recent past discussing the availability of veterinary medicines and the way non-prescription veterinary medicines will be dealt with in the future.  There has been much concern about resistance to drugs and the dangers to human health therein.  Here we are now going to allow non-professional people to have the purchase and sale of those drugs under their authority, rather than under the authority of qualified professionals?  As an example, when a corporate body took over a practice in Northern Ireland, the veterinarian working there was denied access to the drugs that were in that practice when it was taken over.  He has made complaints about the fact that those drugs were then outside of his control.  They are some fundamental points.  Lay ownership of a veterinary practice will not be able to guarantee a 24-hour service because VCI's code of conduct requires a veterinary practitioner to ensure arrangements are made for 24-hour on-call emergency cover.  It is not binding on a non-registered person or body corporate to do that.  That is another point in regard to animal welfare and availability of the service. <\/p> <p>  We have seen corporates grow in other countries.  Unfortunately, the level of service and the cost to the consumer, rural and urban, has increased dramatically as a result.  Corporates will not pick a practice in Connemara or on a peninsula.  They will target large urban small animal practices in intensive farming areas.  Mr. McHugh mentioned the availability of veterinarians.  I know of a large practice that was recently taken over where 11 veterinarians were employed, three of whom partners in the company.  They were part of the purchase and benefited from the sale of the practice, but the other eight veterinarians working there saw their career progression meeting a stone wall.  To get a number of veterinarians into large animal practice is a challenge at the moment.  If we allow corporates to gain a stronghold however, the career progression for those young veterinarians will be severely restricted.  It will become even harder to entice veterinarians coming out of college to go into large animal practices.<\/p><p>If Mr. McHugh wants examples of other European countries protecting professions like this we can look to Germany.  I will read from an article, which states:<\/p><blockquote>\tOn 19 May 2009 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ... confirmed that Germany can have national legislation which prevents non-pharmacists from owning and operating pharmacies ... [the joined cases and case numbers are immaterial here].  This effectively is a ban ... on the outside ownership of pharmacies, and no pharmacy chains will be allowed to operate.<br \/><br \/>According to German law, the principle of the owner-run pharmacy applies: thus only pharmacists are allowed to own and run pharmacies.  There is a ban on outside ownership, in order to thus ensure the job-related independence of the pharmacist. <\/blockquote><p>I believe one can easily correlate that with what we are trying to do with this legislation as regards the veterinary profession.  Therefore, it is clear.  The article goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe ECJ came to the conclusion that the German ban on outside ownership is valid.  Although the ban could be seen as an intervention in the European freedom of establishment, this was balanced against the protection of health.  Each Member State can decide which scope of protection it wants to achieve for the population.  For this reason, a Member State is entitled to exclude non-pharmacists from owning and running a pharmacy if it believes that these persons do not have the necessary job-related independence and therefore constitute a risk for the public health. <\/blockquote><p>I spoke to a veterinarian who rang me because he knows I am sponsoring this legislation.  His practice where he worked was recently bought by a corporate entity; in other words, by laypeople.  He was told that part of his remit for the following year would be to increase the sale of drugs by 10%.  We have people coming in whose aim is to increase their bottom line.  They are not coming from a profession that takes an ethical oath as regards animal welfare when they qualify.<br\/><br\/>While I welcome Mr. McHugh's observations about competition, I feel the opposite is the case in allowing the change in legislation, which from 2005 to 2015 was supported by the Competition Authority at the time.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland's interpretation of the Act was to prohibit the sale of veterinary practices only to veterinarians and to restrict the ownership to veterinarians.  The interpretation of that legislation was changed in 2017.  This committee had a number of committee meetings around that time.  We will be talking to the Veterinary Council of Ireland at a later date.  This amendment to this legislation, however, was borne out of those meetings when the committee at the time, of which the Chairman, Senator Daly and I are probably the only three surviving members, was extremely unhappy with the explanations and reasons that were given to us for the change of interpretation of the legislation.  I have seen advice from the present Attorney General, however, who gave advice to the veterinary union at the time, which very strongly argues that the interpretation taken at that time is not in accordance with the legislation.  This amendment is to make that crystal clear and to reaffirm the previous Veterinary Council interpretation of the Veterinary Practice Bill.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, there are clear precedents in other European countries for this kind of restriction.  It is very much within EU law.  It is up to each member state if it feels that it is warranted from a public health point of view.  At the end of the day, public health is the most paramount thing that we as legislators must protect.  It is clear that what is happening at the moment is in clear breach of the animal remedies regulations, which is under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is very clear that allowing laypersons to have control of the purchase of prescribed drugs cannot be in accordance with that regulation.  There is, therefore, urgency on us to act.<br\/><br\/>We have also seen cases in France where veterinary practices have been delisted because the French authorities felt what was happening there was not in accordance with public good.  The fact that we have corporates established here does not make the Veterinary Council's interpretation of this legislation correct.  As I said, veterinary practices that were owned by corporates have been delisted in France.  There is clear precedent for legislation, therefore, as per the amendment to the Bill that I am sponsoring.<br\/><br\/>While I take on board Mr. McHugh's concerns as regards competition, I feel they are unfounded and that the service we have had provided to us for generations by veterinary practices has worked extremely well for us and for animal welfare.  Whether it is local shows or whatever, veterinary practitioners have never been found wanting in providing voluntary services in their community.  We have a model that has worked extremely well in providing an excellent service to the consumer at a reasonable cost.<br\/><br\/>I am very strongly of the view that this amendment to the Bill will ensure that lasts for further generations.  From the point of view of the consumer and the young veterinarian coming into practice and, as I said, most importantly of all, from the public health and animal welfare point of view, it is absolutely essential that the practice of veterinary medicine is kept under the control of veterinarians.  As I said, we see precedence in other European countries and it is clear that this country, under EU law and competition law, has the remit to amend this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#B00300","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I call Mr. McHugh and Mr. Kenny to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#C00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634684400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I would certainly agree with a couple of things.

As I mentioned, we do not have these arrangements where such corporate ownership is banned for GPs or pharmacies in Ireland.  It is not, therefore, deemed necessary or proportionate in those areas.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into a detailed discussion on the points of law.  I am not a lawyer.  What I would say is that there are real risks in terms of this legislation.  There are a number of cases where similar restrictions have been found to be in breach of European law.  I would suggest that it would be very important that this legislation is subject to legal scrutiny to understand what the risks are in terms of that law.<\/p> <p>  In addition, there may well be constitutional issues in terms of the impact this has on corporates that are currently in place in Ireland, which is very difficult to predict.  As I understand, it would mean some owners of businesses would be criminalised and would need to take actions to divest themselves of that business, which may be a very complicated and painful process for what may be relatively small or even family-run veterinary practices.  Legal issues would, therefore, have to be very carefully considered.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the issues identified by the Deputy, similar issues will come up in terms of GPs and pharmacies, corporates and the individuals responsible for medicines.

Deputy Cahill and the previous speaker have covered many of the areas of interest for me with regard to the proposed amendment to legislation and the opinion of the CCPC.  I will seek clarification on a few points, ask a few questions and make an observation.  Would I be correct in saying that competition law and the CCPC's opinion are superseded or trumped in every case where protection of health, service provision or public interest is at stake?  If Deputy Cahill is correct and we end up with no veterinary services in rural Ireland for large animals and the agricultural sector, would the necessity to provide same supersede anything the witnesses have told us or any competition laws?  Can the witnesses clarify that?<\/p><p>The next issue follows on from Deputy Carthy's conclusion.  If the <i>status quo<\/i>were to remain, as the CCPC wishes, the current opinion of the VCI were to stay in place and the proposed legislation were not introduced, there is every chance that we could end up with a monopoly or cartels within the Irish veterinary service.  I thought the CCPC's role was to protect the consumer from such but I get a different impression from the submission today and the interaction with the two previous speakers.  I would go so far as to agree again with Deputy Carthy - it is becoming a habit - that the CCPC seems to have more interest in protecting corporates than the consumer.  We are teasing this out so I want the witnesses to come back to me on this, but the CCPC's stance will, in my opinion, lead to a monopoly and cartel in the industry.  There is a strong suggestion of such in other areas which the CCPC has been approached to deal with.  How, if the <i>status quo<\/i>remains, will the CCPC help to avoid that?  If it happens, how will it deal with it?<\/p><p>In a similar vein, what if animal drug manufacturers are among the corporates that come in and buy up a number of veterinary practices, amalgamate them and give a directive to their vets, who are supposed to be independent, that they can only prescribe or sell the drugs of the parent company, which is how corporations work?  This would be big business for them.  How would that pan out, as Deputy Cahill asked, in an era where we are all conscious of microbial resistance?  It is part of World Health Organization and One Health policy.  That would affect end consumers and farmers.  If we do not take action now, how does the CCPC propose we deal with a scenario like that?  That would be evident in animal drug manufacturers setting up large veterinary practices by taking over smaller ones or companies whose main interest would be in animal health insurance taking over a number of veterinary practices, concentrating on the small domestic animal, dropping the large animal and the agricultural sector and leaving a void in rural Ireland.  Their main emphasis at point of contact, that is, the reception, would be sale of animal health insurance as opposed to the service they provide.  Do the witnesses not see major problems with that down the line?  Would it not be more prudent, as Deputy Cahill is suggesting, to close the door before the horse - pardon the pun - has bolted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#E00800","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634684400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I will take a few of those issues.  On competition law, the issue here, which we highlighted in the opening statement, was around the services directive and the ability of services in Europe to trade across Europe without restrictions in place.<\/p><p>That is not a competition law issue, but a wider issue linked to the European Single Market whereby entities have the right to trade and invest across that market, and obviously Irish companies and farmers have benefitted a great deal from the Single Market.  That is the issue.  As we have said, and we are agreed to some extent, restrictions can be in place where they are necessary and proportionate.  The issue today is that this has not been necessary, as far as we know, in the veterinary sector in any other European country.  It has not been necessary in other sectors in Ireland, such as general practitioners, dentists and pharmacies.  Many of the issues the Senator raised, which are very real and are issues we would be interested in, would be very similar in those sectors, and the solutions that have been found there are from a regulatory perspective.  That is what we would go back to and suggest.  These very real issues should be looked at, in terms what is necessary and proportionate, from a regulatory perspective where there is a regulator in place.  Where there are potential risks with regard to drugs and how they are prescribed, that is something that could be looked at in the context of what rules and regulations are put in place on those practices and on those vets in respect of prescriptions and making sure that consumers and farmers have the ability to shop around wherever they wish for their drugs when they have been prescribed by a vet.  They are able to have choice as regards getting the cheapest or the best service they can.  That is something we would strongly support.  We do not believe that this legislation is needed to address that point.<\/p><p> The Senator is absolutely right with regard to monopolies and cartels.  That is something we are very concerned about and it is something we work on throughout the economy.  It has not been a particular issue in the veterinary sector thus far, but it is something we would take action on if we thought that there was a monopoly that was going to harm consumers in terms of providing a service or a higher price, ultimately leading to what we call a substantial lessening of competition.  We would take action where we saw that happening.  One area where this might be relevant is that we would like the power to be able to call in mergers.  Currently, any mergers above the threshold must be sent to the CCPC for approval before a merger acquisition can be enacted.  We would also like to have the ability to call in problematic mergers below that threshold.  Where people have evidence that there may be monopolies or there may be problematic arrangements in place and there may be a lack of competition or a lessening of competition in any area in any market, we are always interested in hearing about it.  When we do and where we have the evidence, we will take action.<\/p><p> Another issue I wish to discuss is the actions taken by the CCPC, our views of consumers and our views of corporate.  With regard to competition, to pick one area of our remit, we have recently completed cases against private motor insurance companies, against Ticketmaster and against a UK furniture wholesaler.  These are not small companies.  Some of them are massive multinationals.  Where we saw that there was an issue, we gathered the evidence and where the evidence justified it, we set out our case and secured changes in those markets.  We will continue to follow the evidence.  Regardless of how big a company is, where there is evidence of a breach of competition law we will take action.  The record shows we do that, and we will continue to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian McHugh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>To tease it out a little further, I get the strong impression from Mr. McHugh's response that he sees the CCPC's role as being reactive.

What we are saying is that there is a regulator in place and that the evidence needs to be collected on what the problem is and what might be the options for solutions, including forward-looking ones.  In terms of identifying those issues and addressing them, that is what regulators are for, to a large extent, in many markets.  They are very successful at identifying problems and preventing them.  Our view is that these issues, which may be very real, would have to be examined, the evidence would have to be collected by a regulator and then decisions would be made on what are the best steps to address them, including regulatory actions, as opposed to legislative solutions that have a huge impact on the sector and a potentially huge impact on individuals, customers and employees of the organisations which may be impacted by this legislation.

I am registrar and CEO of the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  I am joined today by Mr. Joe Moffitt, president, and Dr. Ail&iacute;s N&iacute; Riain, deputy president of the veterinary council.  On behalf of the council, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 with the Oireachtas joint committee and thank the members for the invitation to appear before them today.<br\/><br\/>The veterinary council is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the veterinary professions, being veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses in Ireland.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is a statutory body set up under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, and is under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine.  The principal function of the council is to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland in the interests of animal health and welfare and veterinary public health.  The functions of the veterinary council include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct. <br\/><br\/>One point we wish to make clear at the outset is that the veterinary council does not express a view one way or the other on the desirability or otherwise of a restriction on ownership of the sort proposed.  Rather we fully acknowledge this is a policy issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What we hope to do is to identify some of the practical and other issues that may arise in an effort to assist the committee in its considerations.  The council acknowledges it is a wholly a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to adopt legislation that facilitates the regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in a manner that is in the best interests of the public and maintains high standards in the practice of veterinary medicine.  In addition, the council respects the role reserved exclusively for the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine matters of policy regarding public interest and animal health and welfare.  Our principal function is to regulate and manage the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the State in the public interest in accordance with the legislation.<br\/><br\/>The proposed amendments contained in the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 include some significant changes to the ownership of veterinary practices.  The matter of ownership of veterinary practices has not been addressed in Irish legislation heretofore.  The Veterinary Surgeons Act 1931 and the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 do not speak to ownership of veterinary practices.  The Veterinary Surgeons Act 1931 included a prohibition on corporate bodies practising veterinary medicine.  While we can only speculate on the intent of any such legislation it may be that such provision was to ensure that any person suffering losses arising from the actions of a registered person in the practice of veterinary medicine were afforded the opportunity for redress against any individual, preventing the evasion of civil liability by any individual.  The legal requirement for veterinary practitioners to hold a policy of professional indemnity insurance was introduced in 2012 under the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Act 2012, thereby addressing matters relating to civil liability in the public interest.  In contemplation of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, there may have also been some intention regarding the taxable income structures in operation.  Historically,  section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005 was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice.  However, legal advice received by the council advised that the legislation does not speak to the ownership of practices and, thus, the council has no legal authority in determining the ownership of practices under current legislation.  The council has in the past been incorrectly painted as the villain in matters regarding ownership of veterinary practices.  No legislation to date has addressed the issue of veterinary practice ownership.  The council can act only on the powers conferred in law in the interest of animal health and welfare, public interest and public health.  The council has no legal powers over the regulation of the market regarding corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  The parameters of our powers, as established under the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005, do not extend to ownership.  No legislation previously enacted by the Oireachtas has dealt with the matter of ownership of veterinary practices.  Irrespective of approach to ownership of veterinary practices, the council must and will continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions. <br\/><br\/>The question of corporate ownership and other forms of legal ownership, and the linked issue of lay ownership, have been topics of some debate within the profession in recent years.  In this regard, the council engaged Grant Thornton to carry out a significant consultation process in 2019, following which it published in July 2019 a report entitled Analysis of the VCI Consultation on Corporate Ownership of Veterinary Practices, which will be referred to as the Grant Thornton report, a copy of which has been provided to the committee.  We commend this report to the committee and urge that it be considered in detail as it contains much useful background and contextual material.  Importantly, it makes clear that a significant number of veterinary practices are, in fact, incorporated, that is, they are companies.  It is against this backdrop we appear to inform and assist the committee in its consideration of legislation.  The sole objective of the council is to continue to be a trusted and effective regulator and to assist the committee in any policy considerations to ensure practicable, durable and enforceable legislation in the public interest. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We reiterate the point that the council does not express a view one way or the other on the desirability or otherwise of a restriction on ownership of the sort proposed.  Rather we fully acknowledge that this is a policy issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Our hope is to identify some of the practical and other issues that may arise in an effort to assist and inform the committee.  We as a veterinary council currently hold no information on the ownership of veterinary practices as we have no legal basis to make any such request for information.  We currently issue what are referred to as certificates of suitability, as deemed appropriate, to applications from registered persons for specified veterinary practice premises, which meet regulations and standards as laid down by the council.  We collect data and information on any registered persons associated with any veterinary practice, the nature of the veterinary services offered, confirmation of professional indemnity policies held and other such relevant information.  We do not have any information on the owner of a single veterinary practice currently in the country.<br\/><br\/>It appears that there may well be a significant issue regarding pre-existing corporate structures where there are already owners, that is, shareholders, who are not registered veterinary practitioners.  It would appear from the proposed amendment that they would be committing a criminal offence by reason of the simple expedient of their ownership.  It is not clear if this is the intent of the amendments proposed.  Also, it occurs that there may well be legal or constitutional issues here around property ownership and expropriation that might need to be considered.  In the event that there is a real prospect of a requirement to compensate shareholders in the case of expropriation, the council understands the matter of any potential redress for such impacted parties arising as a result of legislative change will be a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this regard, the council understands the proposed legislation will benefit from detailed legal scrutiny in due course.  It is suggested that if restrictions on persons other than registered veterinary practitioners are to be brought into effect then it will be necessary to ensure there are appropriate enforcement and investigative powers to ensure that any law can be enforced.  The council is anxious to ensure that any proposed legislation to be enforced by it is suitably robust and capable of enforcement by it in the public interest and in the interest of animal health and welfare. <br\/><br\/>The council again highlights its wish to assist the committee in the consideration of these matters in a constructive way.  The objective of both our recent written submission and our appearance today is to highlight aspects of the draft legislation that may require further consideration or refinement to ensure that any legislation endorsed by the committee is informed, practical and enforceable.  We respect that matters of policy are reserved for the Houses of the Oireachtas and, accordingly, the council can adopt no position on draft legislation which may fall to it to enforce, if enacted.  As will be apparent from the Grant Thornton report, there is a broad church of opinion within the professions and among the public on the question of corporate ownership and related issues such as lay ownership of veterinary practices.  Many of the views of stakeholders are held deeply and passionately.  The council suggests that there is much important information and useful context in the Grant Thornton report that should shed light on the divergent views and some of the issues that arise.<\/p><p>The report also deals with regulatory structures based on regulation of the individual or regulation of the practice in veterinary regulation in other jurisdictions, in addition to detailing the structures of regulation relied upon for other health professionals, such as doctors, dentists and pharmacists.<\/p><p> Irrespective of the approach to ownership of veterinary practices, the council must continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions.  We will continue to work to ensure that the high standards expected and enjoyed in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that the quality of veterinary care is continuously improving into the future, in the best interests of animal health and welfare and the public interest.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman, Vice Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address them today.  The president of the Veterinary Council, the deputy president and I are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The report and correspondence mentioned by Ms Muldoon were circulated yesterday at the private meeting.

The fact I brought forward this amendment came out of a couple of meetings of the joint committee in the last D&aacute;il, when we had the Veterinary Council with us on more than one occasion.  It was the unanimous view of the Oireachtas committee that we were unhappy with the explanations we got as to why the interpretation of the 2005 legislation was changed in 2017 and 2018.  From 2005 to 2017, it was regulated such that only veterinary practitioners could own veterinary practices but that interpretation of the legislation then changed and allowed lay people to purchase practices.  After a number of these practices were purchased, it was then decided to hold a consultation process to get the views of different stakeholders and individuals, as Ms Muldoon noted.  After that consultation process, the Veterinary Council continued to interpret the legislation in a different way from it did previously.  That is what has brought us here today with this amendment to the Veterinary Practice Bill.<\/p> <p>  I fully accept the Veterinary Council is not a policy maker and that it is there to regulate.  There are a number of points I want to make.  Senators Paul Daly and Tim Lombard were on the previous committee, as was the former Deputy Willie Penrose, who had a very legalistic mind and was extremely unhappy with the way things had progressed.  We are all here around this table to make sure what we do is in the best interests of human health and that human health is protected, which is the first fundamental, and then to protect the consumer and to protect animal health and welfare.<\/p> <p>  We have seen in other jurisdictions that where corporates have gained a stranglehold on the ownership of veterinary practices, the service to the consumer has deteriorated and the cost of that service has increased.  Leaving that aside, the unambiguous reality is that the Veterinary Council has no regulatory control over the operators and lay operators are now the beneficial owners of a number of veterinary practices in this country.  That is a very fundamental point and is what has caused us to bring forward this legislation.<\/p> <p>  While I accept the animal remedies regulation is outside the Veterinary Council's sphere of regulation, it is central to this as well.  As a committee, we have been discussing animal medicines, in particular the availability of non-prescriptive animal medicines, and the worry about resistance among animals and, more importantly, the danger of resistance to drugs for human use, as well as the over-usage of those drugs.  The Department&rsquo;s view is that it wants to regulate the availability of those remedies very significantly.<\/p> <p>  We now have a situation where lay people are able to purchase drugs and keep them in their control, and the Veterinary Council has no regulatory control over those people.  This happened in Northern Ireland, where a vet was locked out of the practice where he worked and kept away from the drugs that were in the practice.  We have physical evidence of where this has happened.  While I accept the animal remedies regulation is in the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Veterinary Council&rsquo;s regulatory powers over drugs and the usage of drugs, in my view, are seriously diminished when veterinarians are not in ownership of the practice.<\/p> <p>  Ms Muldoon said in her statement that ownership was never in the legislation but the previous position was that a veterinary practice in a commercial premises must be wholly owned by veterinary practitioners.  The Veterinary Practice Act operates in conjunction with the code of professional conduct governing the veterinary profession, and that is the statement that was made, namely, the commercial premises have to be completely owned by veterinary practitioners.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to get into a civil war with the witnesses and I would not see that as in any way constructive in the scrutiny of this legislation.  I have been focused on this since the Oireachtas meetings we had and, before that, when representations were made to us by stakeholders about their unhappiness at what was happening in the interpretation of the legislation by the Veterinary Council.  My view is that the Veterinary Council, in changing the interpretation of the legislation, operated outside its remit.  If legislation was to be changed from how it had been operating for the previous 13 or 14 years, it should have been done with amending legislation and that should have been done by the Oireachtas.  If the Veterinary Council was unhappy with the legislation, it should have proposed to the Department and to the Government that it wanted that legislation amended.  Changing the interpretation of it was, in my view, outside its remit.<\/p> <p>  As I said, we have this legislation and we are doing pre-legislative scrutiny of it today.  With the last witnesses, I read out different European Court of Justice decisions which clearly state that, as a state, we have the remit and the authority to make changes and to make any profession restrictive, if we want.  It has been done in Germany, where legislation has been brought in for pharmacies, which is not far removed from what we are talking about, to ensure there is a ban on outside ownership and that there is job-related independence of the pharmacist.<\/p><p>That is done in Germany so we are very much in line with EU law in bringing forward this amendment Bill.  As I said, the principal reason for bringing the Bill forward is to ensure the VCI will have the authority to regulate the operators in the industry.  As it stands, the VCI has not got authority over the owners.  I think that is clear.  They are lay operators and the council does not have authority over them.  The protection of the consumer, animal health and welfare and public health must be paramount.  This Bill will reinforce the powers of the VCI to regulate the industry in the interest of all the aspects I mentioned.<\/p><p> The VCI representatives have made it clear they cannot come in here and dictate to us on what is a policy issue and I respect that.  They have come in to give their views on what the impact of the Bill will be and that is fine.  I would say clearly that protecting public health by limiting the sale and supply of critically important prescription drugs to veterinary practitioners and pharmacists and ensuring the independence of veterinary practitioners and their practice of veterinary medicine are, in my view as a legislator, two very important things to do.  This amendment to the legislation will in my view ensure the VCI has the regulatory power to do that.  As it stands at the moment I am convinced the council has no regulatory authority over lay operators.<\/p><p> There are an awful lot of other issues regarding career paths for young vets.  They will see that corporates taking over practices will curtail their career progression and these are obviously all important issues as well, but human health and the control of medicines is paramount.  These are my principle reasons for bringing forward the Bill but as I said there are other reasons.  We in this country have been very fortunate to have an excellent veterinary service over generations at a reasonable cost.  While we have issues in some isolated rural areas with the availability of vets for large animal practices, I am very clear in my mind that lay ownership of veterinary practices will actually hinder the entry of young veterinarians into the sector.<\/p><p> Lay corporates will target the more lucrative practices.  With some practices that mix small animals and large, the small animal work keeps the practice viable and if that is taken away by a competitor that has no interest in large animals it is going to make it harder to provide services in rural areas.  Vets will tell one it is the small animal work that subsidises the other side of the business.  I think we all agree ensuring public health is protected is paramount.  That is my reason for bringing forward this Bill.<\/p><p> Some people will say we have corporates in now and ask what we are going to do with them.  Again, there are cases in France where practices have been delisted.  Corporates were set up and the French authorities delisted them so in my view that is something that can be addressed and overcome.<\/p><p> What we as a committee must decide is whether this Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill, which would confine ownership of veterinary practices to veterinarians, is in the best interests of public health and animal health and welfare, whether it protects the consumer and whether it is the best possible way to ensure a 24-hour service is provided at a reasonable cost to the consumers vets deliver that service to.  I am very much of the view this is the way forward for us.  As I said, we have seen other countries which have corporates taking over practices in rural areas and the level of service has declined to such an extent that animal welfare has become as serious issue.  I do not want to see us descending to that.  I am first and foremost a farmer and I always had a very good relationship with my veterinary practice.  The services practices provide, virtually at the drop of a hat, must be admired.  That we have such a service provided to us is the envy of other sectors.<\/p><p> This amendment Bill will ensure that service is protected and that the VCI has the regulatory power to ensure public health and animal health and welfare are protected to the utmost.  As I said, I fully accept the council representatives cannot pass a view on the Bill and that it is our job as legislators to do that.  I accept the representatives can come in and point to where they see issues with the impact of this Bill.  We have been discussing the best way to proceed on this for three or four years now .  I am convinced this amendment will deliver what we want for our citizens and also for the veterinary profession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021102000002#K00300","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634684400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The Deputy referenced the excellent veterinary service provided around the country.  In that regard, I must outline the role of the council in regulating the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing by the individuals who deliver that service all around the country.  The VCI's role is in terms of safeguarding our register to ensure any person on it is fit, suitable and suitably qualified and educated.  We accredit and approve the programmes of education such as veterinary medicine in UCD and the veterinary nursing courses around the country.  Members may have some experience of these from relatives graduating from them.  All these inputs work to support the standards, from continuing veterinary education throughout the career of any vet and veterinary nurse, to the code of conduct which is binding on any vet or veterinary nurse in the country.  All these tools available to us as a regulator help to support the strong standards we enjoy in the country.<br\/><br\/>Regardless of any model of regulation, be it on the individual, a veterinary practice or on ownership, no regulator will be able to control the deliver of services <i>per se.<\/i>They are market matters.  Regardless of the preferred model of regulation, that cannot be controlled.  The current model is similar to that enjoyed by the medical, dental and pharmaceutical professions.

If they will bear with me for a moment, I will quote from its code of professional conduct, prior to its amendment.  It is very specific in saying \"Any veterinary practice established in commercial premises must be wholly owned by a veterinary practitioner or group of veterinary practitioners who must be fully responsible for the conduct and practice and for the ethical and legal obligations falling upon its veterinary practitioners.\"  It also states \"The attention of veterinary practitioners is directed to section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 which prohibits the practice of veterinary surgery or medicine by corporate bodies.\"  That was then.  Perhaps we can have some discussion on this.  I want to question the witnesses initially about the position then before moving on to the present.  That was the VCI's code of practice and its interpretation of the Act.  How did it police that at the time?  What would it have done if a corporate had appeared at that time or if the VCI had seen corporate ownership?  The VCI has said here today that it has no control over ownership but in that code of practice, it specifically said that it was responsible for ownership.  It was telling the veterinary, agricultural and corporate worlds who could own a practice and who could not.  If a matter is included in the VCI's code of professional practice, it has responsibility for it.  It has to do what it says on the tin.  How did the VCI police that issue then?  What interactions did it have with veterinary practice owners?  At that time, when the VCI admitted this was part of its role, how did it know who owned veterinary practices?  The witnesses know the point I am trying to make.

Ar dt&uacute;s, rachaidh m&eacute; i ngleic le pr&oacute;tacal Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>First, I will update the committee on the Northern Ireland protocol.  Last week, the European Commission delivered on its promise to people and businesses in Northern Ireland to address their practical, genuine and real concerns.  The European Union's proposals will make it easier to move goods and medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  They will also provide a framework for Northern Ireland having a greater say in how the protocol works.  However, the European Union cannot resolve these issues alone.  We need a partner who is willing to work with us.  We want to get to a jointly agreed and durable solution that provides stability, certainty and predictability for people and investors in Northern Ireland.  Now is the time for the UK Government to engage constructively on practical solutions in order that the benefits of the protocol can be shared by people from all communities.  It was clear from talking to my European colleagues in Luxembourg yesterday that there is strong support for the Commission&rsquo;s approach and strong solidarity with Ireland but, most important, there is strong interest in the issue from around the European Union.<\/p><p>Yesterday, at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, I also discussed a range of other issues on the EU agenda, including the Commission&rsquo;s second annual rule of law report, the Conference on the Future of Europe, Next Generation EU<i><\/i>and the draft conclusions for the European Council taking place tomorrow and Friday.  I am happy to speak on any or all of these areas with committee members in further detail. <\/p><p>The European Union is a union of laws and values.  The rule of law is a fundamental principle for all EU member states and it is of vital importance that the rule of law is preserved, protected and promoted across the Union.  I welcomed Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen&rsquo;s strong words on protecting the rule of law and European values in her recent state of the union address.  I also welcomed her speech in the European Parliament yesterday morning - which I did not see live as she delivered it at the same time as the General Affairs Council meeting was under way - in which she once again emphasised the importance of the rule of law.<\/p><p>Ireland has consistently supported the development of a more comprehensive range of tools by the European Commission to ensure that member states stick to these basic obligations under the EU treaties and basic democratic norms.  This includes the Commission&rsquo;s annual rule of law report and the rule of law budget conditionality mechanism.  As EU member states, there is an onus on us all to comply with determinations of the European Court of Justice with a view to maintaining our shared legal order.  As part of membership of the Union, it is also essential that member states accept the primacy of European Union law, which is a principle of the European Union going back to a time prior to when Ireland was a member.<\/p><p>The judgment of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, which has been made official, is therefore a cause for serious concern for Ireland.  This ruling is the latest development to heighten concerns about judicial independence in Poland following justice system reforms.  These include changes to the disciplinary system for judges, which the Court of Justice has said are not compatible with EU law.  This development underlines the importance of ongoing scrutiny and discussion of the kind provided by the rule of law dialogue.<\/p><p>I also updated my Council colleagues yesterday on Ireland&rsquo;s national programme for the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I will also participate in the second plenary meeting of the conference this weekend as will my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pippa Hackett.  I also raised an issue, of which the committee may wish to be aware.  The European Council meeting will take place this week and the plenary meeting of the conference in December is scheduled for the same week as the December European Council meeting in December.  That will affect the ability of ministers of state with responsibility for European affairs in various European countries to physically attend the meeting in Strasbourg.  However, I certainly encourage Oireachtas members to be there in person.<\/p><p>We must all do as much as we can to publicise the conference and encourage greater public engagement.  We cannot be indifferent about the conference as it is too important in terms of the valuable opportunity it provides for ordinary citizens to have their say on Europe&rsquo;s future and also the recommendations which might ultimately result from the process now under way.  I thank the committee for its engagement in the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I know it has been a priority of the committee for some time.  I am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021102000002#C00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that update.

The Minister of State referred, mainly with respect to Poland, to the supremacy of European Union law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.

This will lead to a substantial reduction in checks while at the same time, importantly, protecting the Single Market, which is crucial for Ireland.  It gives Northern Ireland the real benefits of the best-of-both-worlds approach, with Northern Ireland in the Single Market for goods but also part of the customs territory of the UK.<\/p><p> The European Court of Justice was raised by both Deputy Haughey and Senator Chambers.  It is important to be very clear.  First, in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement there is no role for the Court of Justice.  In the protocol it has a very limited and specific role which, to be honest, I cannot see really arising in practice.  It is difficult even to think of how it could arise in practice.  Essentially, Northern Ireland is in the Single Market for goods.  Disputes relating to goods' standards or whether goods are allowed in the Single Market could theoretically end up in the Court of Justice of the European Union but, as I understand it, it is such a theoretical issue that there is currently only a handful of cases across the entire European Union relating to goods before the Court of Justice.  In fact, cases in the Court of Justice relating to goods are actually some of the foundational cases dating back up to 50 years, which Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey would probably have studied in college.  They go back that far and they are foundational aspects of the Single Market.  All that the provision in the protocol does is apply that.<\/p><p> Ultimately, any single market for goods needs regulation, which is the rules of the European Union.  The protocol lists a certain set of regulations that apply to goods in Northern Ireland and, ultimately, there has to be an arbitrator, a court, that is the bedrock of the Single Market, and that is the Court of Justice of the European Union.  It is part and parcel of the Single Market.  When we say Northern Ireland is part of the Single Market for goods, it means that goods can flow freely from Northern Ireland to the European Union and, most importantly, between the North and South on this island, which is the rationale for it, that those goods must adhere to certain standards and, ultimately, in theoretical cases, that the Court of Justice of the European Union could decide on issues relating to those matters.  The rules for the Single Market are so set in stone and specifically set out in the protocol that it is very hard to see how this issue would arise in practice, but it is part and parcel of the Single Market and the benefits that it gives to Northern Ireland.  I do not see it as a burden in any way.  In fact, I do not see it as an interference in any way with British sovereignty.  Northern Ireland is in the Single Market as a type of exception with a specific international agreement, which is what the protocol is.  This is simply part of it, and I doubt there will be many lawyers in Belfast taking cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union on goods issues.  It is very difficult to envisage it.  However, it is part and parcel of what Northern Ireland gets with the Single Market.<\/p><p> Poland is obviously a major concern, and Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey asked similar questions about what we can do about it.  There are many hard and soft powers.  The Article 7 proceedings were mentioned by Deputy Haughey.  That is one of the most important measures the European Union has.  However, it is very difficult to operate in practice.  There are the Article 7 hearings that take place at the General Affairs Council, on which I sit.  Ultimately, if they were voted up to the European Council, technically some voting rights could be withdrawn as punishment for a breach of the rules, but the voting majority requirements to get it out of the General Affairs Council are quite steep and at the European Council there must be unanimity, which would be difficult to achieve in the current political circumstances, as members of the committee will understand.  However, the Article 7 proceedings have been started and it is difficult to see a way to finish them.  It is important.  We had Article 7 hearings in June and that shone a light on certain issues at that time, particularly in Hungary.  Yesterday, we had a rule of law dialogue where we again shone a light on particular issues.<\/p><p> In terms of the practical next steps, the public pressure from the D&aacute;il and Seanad and from the general public in Ireland on LGBT rights, for example, has had a direct impact on some of those towns that had LGBT-free zones.  We can talk to our friends, the Poles, and say that we do not believe this is acceptable, that it needs to change and the reasons are that it is about human decency, human dignity and human rights.  In quite a number of cases, those designations by local authorities in Poland have been reversed through public pressure, much of it coming from Ireland.  In addition, the European Commission has withdrawn funding for certain municipalities in Poland which have initiated these designations.  That public pressure cannot be understated.  There is also, of course, the conditionality regulation, which would make the disbursal of European moneys, particularly from the recovery and resilience fund, conditional on adherence to the rule of law and democratic values.  That regulation is in force, but it is being challenged in the Court of Justice of the European Union at present.<\/p><p> The Commission is taking this very seriously and carefully.  For example, it has not yet approved the recovery and resilience plans for Hungary and Poland.  It is also conscious that there is a case before the Court of Justice.  Ireland took part in that case in support of the Council.  Last week, our lawyers were arguing that case.  That is a very important step by us to show that we take this very seriously.  We certainly support the conditionality mechanism and want to see it implemented, provided the Court of Justice rules in favour of it.  That is a very practical measure.  The Polish and Hungarian people are our friends and common Europeans.  We have to keep talking and keep a dialogue going in respect of all these issues.  That is very important.  The committee can play its role in that too, and I am sure it does.  We need to keep in touch.  They are our friends and not everybody in those countries agrees with the direction the governments are taking, and that provides an opportunity.<\/p><p> With regard to enlargement, Ireland is totally supportive of the enlargement of the European Union.  The Taoiseach made very strong comments in Slovenia on that.  He had good engagement with his counterparts from the western Balkans countries, in particular.  I have had similar engagement, too, and I strongly encourage the committee to have whatever engagement it considers fit with its counterparts in the western Balkans.  Yes, there are obviously processes to go through.  We have to make sure that the rule of law, democratic values and economic reforms are all bedded down, but we should be as encouraging and helpful as possible.  In any of my engagements with colleagues from the western Balkans I have offered Ireland's full support not only in terms of the ultimate ambition of EU membership but also our help along the way on the road to it.<\/p><p> I hope that answers the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021102000002#C00700","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634684400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is next.

I will follow up on a number of the issues he has dealt with.  Obviously, the Irish protocol remains paramount for us.  In fairness, it appeared that the Commission and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi pushed themselves as far as they possibly could to find a solution which, I believe, a considerable number of people in the North, even with a unionist background, who are businessmen, farmers and so forth will be quite happy to work with.  I have not seen the large level of demonstrations and whatever else is happening within political unionism.  Is the Minister of State aware of whether there is that general constructive feeling on the ground of just getting on with it?  We have the background noise of Boris Johnson and particularly David Frost while we have the positive that there is an element of engagement, which has to be welcomed.  To a degree, one is second-guessing on the basis of what someone says which might be for a particular constituency, and that can change overnight.  I understand that the Minister of State cannot give complete clarity, just his interactions with regard to the North, particularly as regards the business community and so forth in respect of working this.<\/p><p>We also had the European Commission representation in Ireland and they said officials from the Commission were ready to go the minute these documents were done, from a point of view of ensuring all this was workable.  We are all in agreement that the Irish protocol is the only show in town and is not for moving.  As long as the EU and the Commission maintain that as the starting point and we get workable operational changes, that is where the future is.  Anything else that is possibly being threatened would be utterly unacceptable, particularly in an Irish context.<\/p><p> Senator Chambers brought up the Conference on the Future of Europe and the events that are to be organised throughout this State.  The European movement is carrying out lead in relation to it.  It is about ensuring we get out and beyond those that are interested.  It can be difficult for even regular, localised politics to get to those who see themselves as outside the political sphere.  There is an onus on us to make it real and involve as many people as possible.  The northern dimension is a big thing.  We have a democratic deficit and there seem to be moves towards dealing with that.  Will the Minister of State go into a bit of detail on that?  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has been supportive.  It is difficult in the North in that there is not representation or, necessarily, engagement on a localised level.  That is something we would have to deal with.  <\/p><p> What is the timeline for the rule of law issues, as regards the case in front of the European Court of Justice, ECJ?  We have all asked what leverage there is within the European Union as regards dealing with breaches of the rule of law.  I accept what the Minister of State has said to the effect that positive peer pressure can have an impact regarding local authorities and localised actions by councils that were twinned and pieces of work like that.  Our first port of call should always be talk and negotiation, rather than leverage, but there is the question of the recovery and resilience funding.  The multiannual framework or whatever one wants to call it is the big money issue.  There was a difficulty in twinning that with rule of law issues.  Where does that stand?<\/p><p> There are other issues beyond those, such as those relating to Poland and Hungary.  I imagine those states from time to time say there is rule of law for them but not for some of the more senior members of the European Union or those who were there earlier.  I am back talking about the disgraceful way Catalonian representatives have sometimes been dealt with by the Spanish Administration.<\/p><p> On the European Council, the main issues regarding Government focus at this point will relate to that.  We are in a different place here as regards the pandemic.  Just when we thought we were out, we are back in.  It is almost like a Mafia film.  The big issue is around none of us being safe until all of us are safe.  I heard a great amount of narrative around the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver.  We have had a Commission representative state it is a misnomer and that there is greater capacity in the pharmaceutical community now to produce what is needed.  How do we deliver what needs to be delivered throughout the developing world and provide more than COVAX, which is only looking at 20% of the populations in developing countries?  I am not wedded to a TRIPS waiver, but we need a solution that means the developing world can get vaccines relatively cheaply and then we can deal with the logistical questions of getting them out.  The likes of the European Union has a huge role to play in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021102000002#D00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I confirm I am in the wilds of Agriculture House.  I thank the Minister of State.  I listened to what he said and it reminded me of the discussion we had last week with Barbara Nolan.  We discussed the rule of law.  I will make one or two comments and ask one or two questions.  Coming back to Article 7, at one level one wonders if it is toothless.  How can we get out of the General Affairs Council and the European Council?  It depends who votes what way.  It is not that I have an issue with that but how useful is it in this situation?  My question is deeper than that.  If the ECJ were to come back with a finding that did not allow the EU to proceed, that would have significant ramifications for current and future issues around the rule of law.  That is musing on my part.  I do not necessarily want the Minister of State to comment unless he wants to, but I would be delighted to hear it.<\/p> <p>  As to how we proceed, last week when discussing this with Barbara Nolan, I said I agreed that we need to tread very carefully.  The escalation this week was significant.  For the first time since I left the Parliament, somebody contacted me about that speech.  That surprised me.  This person found it so significant and wondered what my perspective was.  I listened to Sean Kelly MEP.  I have heard him make many speeches over the years on this and other issues, but his speech indicated a very strong position.  I would consider it a change in position from the Government.  Would the Minister of State be happy to comment on that?<\/p> <p>  When it comes to conditionality, we had many debates.  My concern about conditionality is always that it is a double-edged sword.  If we use the withholding of European funds, that becomes a weapon for those in power to say there is an impact on the people of Poland because the EU is withholding funds.  I understand there is carrot and stick and that money talks; nonetheless, we could get badly bitten by this.<\/p> <p>  The last point I will make is a general comment.  When we talk about the supremacy of EU law, it is important we understand that we do not have EU law in every circumstance.  Things happen throughout Europe that we as individuals, as politicians or as members of political parties might not agree with but not all of it is covered by EU law.  That means the European Court of Justice can only act in certain circumstances.  Sometimes we need to be careful when we talk about the EU acting in areas where it does not have competence.<\/p><p>It is something I have noticed over a long period of time and it can confuse people outside the system.  It is not that I am an expert in it - far from it - but I have seen on many occasions people talking about the EU acting when in fact, there is probably no legal basis for it to act.  I will be speaking in the D&aacute;il in a short while so I must leave soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021102000002#E00200","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I will answer the question on the Conference on the Future of Europe first because it was a follow-up question from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that I did not really address in my previous answer.  The Government has organised a number of events.  Obviously, Covid has restricted things.  With EMI and through the Department of Foreign Affairs, I have met a wide range of groups in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, including meetings on a regional basis and meetings with marginalised groups and civic society.  I have met young people, LGBT groups, people from the Gaeltacht, islanders and inner-city representatives so I have met a wide range of groups.<\/p> <p>  Covid has hampered this process.  With restrictions having eased, we are planning other events.  The Conference on the Future of Europe is not dependent on the Government organising meetings or events.  Everybody can do that.  This committee has done it.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad can do it.  Fianna F&aacute;il has done a seminar on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I encourage other parties to replicate that.  We will do more as well.  There will be Government-run events.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at the citizens' panel that will take place in Dublin in December.  That is obviously a European event.  It is not our event but it probably would be an opportune time for all of us to raise the profile of the Conference on the Future of Europe at that time because there will be substantial media interest in these randomly selected European citizens coming to Dublin to have their conversation.  If any of the Irish randomly selected citizens would like to speak out about their experience, it would be really helpful and interesting because about eight Irish citizens are involved in this.  I do not know any of them.  Commissioner Reynders, who is also responsible for GDPR, said that if we can get this through GDPR, he would certainly like to facilitate it.

I ask anybody who would be interested - and I do not know their identities - to please speak out and say whether he or she thinks it is a good or bad process and what he or she thinks of the issues involved.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the protocol, I again thank the Opposition and members from all political parties for the unified approach to Brexit in this country.  We adopted that approach in opposition and I see the Opposition doing it now.  It is so important that when a member of the Government, whichever party is in government and that changes all the time, goes to Europe there is a united approach in this country on this issue.  It speaks volumes to our colleagues in Europe.  When I arrived at the General Affairs Council yesterday, quite a number of my European colleagues approached me to see what my reaction and the Irish reaction was.  I had spoken to some of them already.  Members will find that, by and large, European colleagues listen to the Irish reaction and accept it.  Many of them do.  Yes, there will be different nuances from some member states regarding particular issues but, generally speaking, the Irish approach is certainly asked for and adopted.  I thank my colleagues for that.<\/p> <p>  I know that this time last year, I was telling Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that a European minister was coming to the Deputy's constituency along the Border.  It did not happen because of Covid and we did not know about numbers but another minister from another country has indicated that they want to come to see the Border this year.  We wonder all the time whether the interest is being sustained.  It is being sustained.  All long as Covid allows it, which I suspect it will, I will invite Border Deputies to meet that minister once the visit has been arranged and we get confirmation.  We have not confirmed it yet.  It is fantastic to see that interest and that ministers from other countries ask to visit the Border.  That is very welcome.  They are also very aware of the peace process and are as frustrated as the Deputy and I are at times but they also know that what we are doing here is to make sure there is peace on the island and prosperity in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I broadly welcome the unionist approach, particularly when they talk about welcoming, engaging and acknowledging that the Commission came a long way.  These are phrases we heard from the unionist community.  That type of reaction gives space this week for talks.  The significant and immediate public support from business and agriculture on a cross-community basis was really welcome.  People in Europe are pleased to see that and that what they feel is a good package has been received as such.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of background noise.  I acknowledge it is very difficult to stay out of that at times but sometimes we have to do so, for example, to allow space for these conversations to take place this week and in the coming weeks.  I hope the process will not be too long.  The Commission has gone a long way and it is very hard to find real arguments.  The argument about the European Court of Justice is not a sovereignty question.  We saw the issue of weights and measures this week.  Again, nobody knows what an ounce is - let us be honest about it - so I suspect that is not going to be an issue.  We already have some exemptions in Northern Ireland.  For example, there was never any issue with miles or yards on signposts in Northern Ireland so sometimes these issues are exaggerated.  We want what is best for business and people in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I might briefly discuss Covid.  What the Taoiseach would like to see this week from the European Council, particularly with regard to Covid, is very strong messaging on booster vaccines.  That is something he has been talking about and about which he is very keen.  We have seen the efficacy of the booster vaccines in countries where they have been applied.  We are delighted that booster vaccinations for the over-60s have got the go-ahead from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  We are obviously concerned about the rest of the population, particularly healthcare workers, who have been among the longest vaccinated.  We know about the effect of the vaccines waning.  The European Medicines Agency has already spoken about booster vaccines in a very positive way and I think the Taoiseach will be very keen to have the issue advanced at a political level as well.  He will be looking for strong statements on this from the European Council.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the rule of law, which was raised by Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Harkin, many different measures are being used but, ultimately, we just have to keep talking as well.  That is what I am saying.  I could go through the entire Article 7 process.  There is a long process and we are not near the end.  It is useful to keep these issues in the spotlight.  It is not just for us to keep them in the spotlight.  It keeps them in the spotlight in home countries as well.  The European Court of Justice made a decision in July and the Commission sought from the court what it calls an exceptional step to impose a daily penalty on Poland citing a lack of compliance with the July court decision.  It has, therefore, been taking this matter very seriously.  This is only for a matter of months.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Harkin asked what would happen if the conditionality regulation fails at the ECJ.  I do not think I should get involved while the court is deciding the case.  Ireland intervened in a very strong way in support of the Council position.  I think that will be very strong.  This funding is important.  We want to see progress, particularly in eastern Europe and less developed economies, but we are also paying for it.  We pay for that with a generous heart.  The Taoiseach and the previous Government did not join the frugal four at the time but when we are funding this, it is reasonable for us to ensure that democratic values and the basic values of the EU are upheld.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with Deputy Harkin that there is any change in the position of the Government.  I have spoken to the Taoiseach and at meetings of ministers with responsibility for European affairs.  We have taken a very strong line on this and I am very strong in my interactions with the General Affairs Council and the public media regarding these issues.<\/p><p>We have also been a member of a like-minded group on the rule of law for quite a number of years so we are certainly not out of the mainstream on these issues.  I would not say there is a change in position from Government on this.  The Government is very strong on this, and it is likely to be raised at the European Council.  It is not on the agenda at the moment but it is certainly likely to be raised.  There will be some strong statements on this which will be looking for action.  <\/p><p> On the supremacy of EU law, the European Single Market for example could not function if there was a standard set by the European Union and then some countries opt not to comply with that but to have a different standard.  It is not actually a matter of power, or sovereignty.  It is really a matter of practicalities about how we ensure that the rules are the same in every country.  Those rules traditionally were those of the Single Market but of course our values are also fundamental to us.<\/p><p> It is important when we are talking about the European Court of Justice to keep saying - it is a great phrase from an Austrian colleague - that Europe is not Brussels or Strasbourg or Luxembourg.  This is Europe.  Achill Island is Europe.  Recently we had a judgment from the European Court of Justice as Gaeilge.  I met the plaintiff who took the case, he is from County Meath.  This is our court.  It is not some foreign court as it would perhaps have been described in the debate in Europe.  This is a court that is the ultimate arbiter of areas, and Deputy Harkin is right, where the European Union has competence.  If the European Union does not have competence then the European Court of Justice will not get involved.  It is our court.  Our people are on that court.  Gerard Hogan, one of the most respected legal jurists in this country ever, who has just been appointed to the Supreme Court here has just come from being Advocate General to that court.  So this is a court with a huge Irish influence over the years and that continues today with the current appointees as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021102000002#F00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I am not in Leinster House.

I thank the Minister, Deputy Byrne, for a comprehensive answer to what was a considerable number of questions.  On the rule of law issue, I accept that talking has to take primacy.  I accept what is happening at the minute and the processes in regard to Article 7 and then the recovery and resilience funding, which matters because money counts on leverage.  At one stage when budgets were being finalised there was talk of there possibly being rule of law implications but there was a constitutional difficulty around that.  Has the European Council or the EU in any general sense looked at that?  Are we any further on in regard to operating that on a wider basis?  I refer only to having the leverage, one might not necessarily ever use it.  Better to have the stick than not have it.<\/p> <p>  The other question goes back to - obviously we are in a different place in regard to Covid-19 at this time and booster vaccines could be a mitigation that would make a huge difference, so that needs to be top of the agenda, I agree with Deputy Byrne on that - the TRIPS waiver and the European Commission has placed itself in a particular place on that argument.  I do not particularly care if somebody puts a plan out and says \"here is how we deliver for the developed world\" and I mean something more than COVAX, the best-case scenario for which is 20% of the populations in developed countries and that is accepting there will be logistical difficulties in regard to it working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021102000002#G00600","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>On the rule of law conditionality, this is the sequence.  The recovery and resilience fund was agreed last year as part of the budget negotiations, an unprecedented financial boost from the European Union to try to boost the economies of the entire European Union.  We need to get away from - and I do not accuse this committee of this - sometimes speaking in terms of \"how much is Ireland getting\" and \"how much is Italy getting\" or whatever because actually a country like Ireland benefits no matter who gets it.  Our companies will be trading with those countries and we depend on those countries doing well.  Also some of the money that is allocated to other European countries will end up being spent here, maybe on computer or pharmaceutical companies, whatever the case may be.<\/p> <p>  There was concern that funding would be subject to rule of law conditionality so there were many discussions this time last year from October to Christmas between the European Council and the European Parliament.  Ultimately agreement was reached after much discussion and the rule of law conditionality regulation was put in place.  It was then challenged by Hungary and Poland, and it was part of the political agreement with the European Council that they could do that.  That case is now pending before the European Court of Justice.  We supported the conditionality regulation, and the rule of law conditionality in regard to funding being allocated.  We took part in that case at the European Court of Justice.  Our lawyers were central to the arguments being made in support of the European Council position.  We will await the outcome of that decision.  I cannot give a timeline but I understand it will be relatively soon.  It took place only last week so we will let the European Court of Justice decide that case.  My understanding is it will possibly be next month but I am not a spokesperson for the court so we will let it do that, but it has happened very quickly.

While there was an export mechanism, one supply of vaccines was actually refused to be exported.  There has been a huge exporting of vaccines.  There are COVAX, direct donations, on which the Irish Government has given a major commitment.  We must also recognise that the research and development part of this is really important for the entire world, but that research and development does not come out of nothing.  I pay tribute to those Irish people who have been involved in this.  We have a very strong name for pharmaceuticals.  We have not heard too much about the aspects of the supply chain that were in Ireland but there were some.  Obviously we recently heard that Pfizer is opening a plant to supply more of that supply chain.  The issue of the TRIPS waiver will continue to be discussed and there are varying views at a European level on that, to get agreement on it.  What the Government will do, and it is absolutely committed to this, is make sure that as many people throughout the world get access to this vaccine as quickly as possible in whatever the most efficient method is.

The purpose of the meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders who have made written submissions on the aforementioned Bill.  Our witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee, and in all cases, from outside the Leinster House precincts.  Members are appearing both virutally and physically, but in all cases, from within the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  I will invite them to speak in the order in which we received written submissions.  From the Policing Authority, I welcome Mr. Bob Collins, chairperson; and Ms Helen Hall, chief executive.  Next, in terms of order of submissions received, I welcome representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, Chief Inspector Mark Toland and Deputy Chief Inspector Pauline Shields.  From the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, we are joined by Ms Doireann Ansbro, head of law and policy; and Ms Gemma McLoughlin-Burke, procedural rights fellow, who are most welcome.  Last, and by no means least, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are joined by Commissioner Drew Harris and his colleagues, Deputy Commissioners Anne Marie McMahon and Shawna Coxon.  They are welcome.  It is good to have them with us to hear their views and exchanges.  We have introduced a protocol whereby representatives of the Department of Justice attend our meetings as observers, not necessarily to present, but to be available to answer questions and clarify matters as the need arises.  In that role, we are joined today by Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant Secretary General; and Ms Anne Barry, principal officer.<\/p> <p>  I have already mentioned housekeeping in terms of the muting of microphones.  I ask participants to be mindful of that as the meeting progresses.  The other point is the usual note around privilege, with which regular attendees will be familiar.  For anyone who is not, it is important to reiterate our procedures.  All attendees are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a manner as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  For witnesses, in particular those attending remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House campus, they should be aware there are some additional limitations to parliamentary privilege.  They would enjoy greater privilege were they able to participate in the meeting physically.  Obviously, that is not possible for a variety of reasons.  I ask them to be mindful that there may be some differentiation in the level of the immunity that they may enjoy in terms of parliamentary privilege as opposed to being in a position to be physically present.  Finally, I ask all participants to strictly adhere to the subject matter rather than straying into other areas.  We want to keep the discussion on topic. <\/p> <p>   The format of the meeting is that each organisation will be invited in the order in which I have introduced them to make an opening statement.  Each organisation will have three minutes to do this.  Once all the statements have been delivered, I will then go around the members and invite them to put questions to the witnesses.  We have a procedure whereby each member is allocated seven minutes for the first round, including both the questions and responses.  If time permits, we will facilitate a second round of questions.  We will see how we go.  Members may have other questions asked in the first round, or indeed, some other Members may join the meeting.  I know that there is at least one Member who does not normally attend the committee and has indicated his wish to join the meeting later on, namely, Deputy McNamara.  He is welcome to join the meeting, as is anyone else.  Non-members will contribute to the meeting after committee members have asked their questions.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Collins to make his opening statement to the committee.  He has three minutes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#B00100","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634684400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The 2015 legislation that established the Policing Authority was intended to make a difference, and it did.  It created an independent, external oversight arrangement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where none had ever existed before.  It created a greater structural distance between the Department and the organisation, and it created a distance between politics and policing.  It was the settled view of the Government and Oireachtas that this was necessary.  That was less than six years ago.<\/p> <p>  These heads of Bill, and the Commission on the Future of Policing report on which its approach is based, take a significant step back from that character of oversight. Repatriation to the Department and re-internalisation within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the potential to alter significantly the relationships between the Garda, the Department and the proposed new authority.  There is, and there will be seen to be, an inescapable drawing back from those changes that were deemed so necessary just six years ago.  Nowhere, in the commission report or in the heads of Bill, is there any significant or convincing argument why such a sharp shift is necessary or appropriate. There is much to welcome in the Bill.  The joining together of the authority and the Inspectorate has the potential to be greatly beneficial both to the oversight and inspection roles.  The authority also welcomes the changes made since the initial draft heads were first outlined last year.  However, there continue to be issues that are of considerable concern to the authority, for example, returning responsibility to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for determining the policing plan.  The authority&rsquo;s much reduced engagement will not be out of its own statutory capacity but at the invitation of the Commissioner.  That is a significant shift of policy and practice and weakens oversight.  What is its logic?<\/p> <p>  The same is true in respect of the Garda strategy.  The termination of the authority&rsquo;s role in appointments is a major change of direction.  Apparently based on a wholly unfounded sense that the new arrangements would give the Commissioner a greater role in appointments, this shift flies in the face of the Garda culture audit and the widely felt unhappiness at recruitment practice within the organisation.  This is a retrogressive move.<\/p> <p>  The weakening of the authority's role in the appointment of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner follows the same pattern.  So does the return to the Commissioner, under some unspecified regulatory framework, of the recruitment of superintendents, a critically important role in the policing service.  Why these steps, in respect of appointments, are being taken is, to put it mildly, unclear.<\/p> <p>  The role of the new Garda board seems to suggest that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is no different from any other State body.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is precisely because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is so wholly different in its role, duties and powers that a strong external oversight mechanism is necessary.  The value to the organisation of outside expertise is not in question.  However, what is virtually certain is the risk that the new structure will alter the nature of the current oversight, will cause confusion as to roles and responsibilities and have the potential to pose unnecessary difficulties for the Commissioner.<\/p> <p>  The authority worries that this Bill will convey the wrong messages about policing.<\/p><p>It will be seen as a backward step.  It has the potential to slow and inhibit, rather than support and encourage, the programme of change to which the authority is committed and to which it knows the Commissioner is also committed. <\/p><p> If anything shows the importance of strong, independent external oversight, it can be seen in the authority&rsquo;s handling of the homicide review and of the current issues with the cancellation and handling of 999 calls.  The strength of that capacity should not be put in doubt. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins for that.

I will focus on three points, those of community safety, the functions of the new policing and community safety authority, PCSA, and the inspection function within that authority.<\/p> <p>  The Bill provides for a national strategy on community safety, which supports a previously made recommendation by the inspectorate.  For multi-agency co-operation to be effective, there must be strong enabling legislation, accompanied by a recognition by relevant agencies of their role, a strategic commitment to meeting their responsibilities and, where necessary, providing appropriate levels of resources. Without this in place, community safety will remain as the responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p> <p>  The community safety responsibilities of the PCSA are diluted from the role envisaged by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which recommended that the PCSA promote inter-agency working and scrutinise the role of all agencies as they affect community safety.  In addition, the PCSA will be limited to the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to the delivery of policing services.  The PCSA will not be responsible for oversight of the delivery of security services, as is currently the case for the inspectorate.  This will become the responsibility of the independent examiner who will also have oversight of the use of legal powers such as surveillance.  While such powers are used to investigate crimes against the State, they are also used to investigate other offences, including serious and organised crime.  It is important to ensure there are no gaps in oversight between the role of the independent examiner and the PCSA in this critical area. <\/p> <p>  The role of the Garda board to monitor implementation of organisational performance is similar to the objective of the PCSA.  To avoid any confusion regarding objectives and functions, the roles of and relationships between the Garda Commissioner, the Garda board and the PCSA need to be further clarified. <\/p> <p>  While the inspectorate welcomes the power to allow PCSA inspectors of policing services to carry out unannounced visits to Garda stations, it should be set out in legislation and not be reliant on a memorandum of understanding.  It is also important that provision is made in the legislation to ensure the PCSA is provided with all information and documents necessary to exercise its functions. <\/p> <p>  While provision is made for conducting joint inspections by prescribed bodies, the attachment of conditions on this taking place does not appear to be sufficiently strong enough to ensure that joint inspections will take place.  Enabling the PCSA to publish reports of self-initiated inspections and monitor the implementation of recommendations arising from inspections will close two current gaps in inspectorate powers.  The inspectorate believes inspection should be a core function of the new PCSA. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Toland"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Toland for that.

In this statement we will summarise our key concerns with the policing, security and community safety Bill, as outlined in more detail in our two written submissions.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL welcomes the provisions for reformed police oversight mechanisms, which we regard as being broadly in line with recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Robust oversight is crucial in order to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is complying with its human rights obligations and is held accountable to the people it serves.  Provision for independent and effective investigations into complaints against police is a key human rights requirement on the State.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL recognises that a number of welcome reforms have taken place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, strong and effective oversight of policing is central to the police reform process.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was clear that reform of Irish policing is impossible without significant strengthening of our police oversight structures, including the provision of additional resources.  The proposed establishment of a new policing and community safety authority, an independent examiner of security legislation, and a reformed Ombudsman are welcome. The increased references to human rights contained in the Bill compared with the 2005 Act are also encouraging. <\/p> <p>  We outlined eight recommendations in our first submission on how the Bill can be strengthened from a human rights perspective and today we will highlight four.  The first recommendations is the Bill should remove all prosecutorial powers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both victims and accused persons have the right for their case to be prosecuted by an impartial legal professional.  This was a key recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The second recommendation is the Bill should include a provision on the mandatory collection of disaggregated data on policing and use of police powers.  These data should be based on equality grounds, socio-economic status, geographic location and ethnicity.  Such data collection is required under international human rights law.  The third recommendation is that the Garda code of ethics should expressly include human rights standards.  A breach of the code should constitute a disciplinary offence.  The fourth recommendation is that while we welcome provisions for independent inspections of Garda stations, the ICCL calls on the Government to provide for wholly unannounced visits to Garda custody suites unconnected to a planned inspection.  Independent visits to Garda stations and other places where people are deprived of their liberty are a crucial safeguard against abuse and are a requirement under the optional protocol to the UN convention against torture, which the Irish Government has signed but must ratify and implement as a matter of urgency. <\/p> <p>  The ICCL urges the Government to ensure that the oversight bodies foreseen by this legislation are properly resourced and given sufficient powers to ensure that proper reform is delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Ansbro"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ansbro.

I thank you for this opportunity to give evidence to the committee.  Certainly after the publication of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na accepted its recommendations in full.  That remains the case.  This has been followed by organisational commitment in implementing those recommendations under the Government&rsquo;s A Policing Service for the Future reform programme.  This has seen a large number of initiatives introduced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to improve the policing service we deliver to the public and provide additional supports for our personnel.  For example, we have enhanced community policing as demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic.  More than 820 garda&iacute; have been redeployed from administrative roles to the front line   Divisional protective services units are in place in every division staffed by more than 300 specialist garda&iacute;.  A new Garda anti-corruption unit has been introduced to promote the highest levels of integrity and professionalism within the organisation.  We have had the establishment of a human rights unit and investment in human rights training across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An organisational redesign under the Garda operating model has continued throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>  For our people, we have introduced measures such as a more transparent promotion process, improved internal communications and additional health and well-being supports.  These significant advances would not have been possible without the support of our personnel.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully supports accountability, oversight and the independent investigation of public complaints as a route to public confidence in policing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agrees with the commission&rsquo;s view that Garda oversight should be streamlined, should not lead to micromanagement of the Commissioner by those oversight bodies, and should not impinge on the operational independence of the Commissioner.  The commission also said that the Commissioner should be a true CEO in charge of all executive functions who would have the support of an internal board in carrying out those functions.  However, what is proposed under the current wording of the Bill will see the introduction of a wide range of oversight structures and bodies with overlapping remits that will see the Commissioner of the day spending disproportionate time reporting and accounting to those bodies rather than actually overseeing policing, security matters, and the leadership and direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An example, under the proposed Bill, is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be accountable for inter-agency co-operation to the new policing and community safety authority, yet the other State agencies involved would be reporting to the new national community safety steering group, to which we will also report.  <\/p> <p>  The Bill, as proposed, will effectively outsource many of those levers of control in key areas such as the budget, discipline, standards and policing operations from the Commissioner to different oversight bodies - in effect, the micromanagement and erosion of operational independence that the Commission strongly warned against.   It also gives the replacement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, more legal powers to conduct investigations into Garda personnel, including Garda staff, which garda&iacute; investigating crime currently enjoy.<\/p><p>Investigations by the new GSOC could run on for long periods without any obligation for them to inform the Garda or employer about the nature of what they are being investigated for and whether it is criminal, misconduct or civil.  This would appear to be in breach of an individual's human rights as well as being incredibly stressful for them.  Furthermore, I as Garda Commissioner and  the employer may not be made immediately aware of investigations related to serious matters.  My management team and I have met with the Minister for Justice and senior Department officials to discuss our concerns, as detailed in our 75-page submission to the committee, and those discussions have been productive.<\/p><p> To conclude, the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing were necessary, timely, and have already benefited the people of this country in terms of the policing service provided.  What we are asking is that the proposed Bill more accurately reflects the commission&rsquo;s recommendations so An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can continue to operate ethically, efficiently, and effectively to keep the people safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I invite members to contribute in the order in which they have indicated.

That is the kind of arrangement envisaged in 2005 Act but was never acted upon.  That was 16 years ago.  The Commissioner has made some reference to it but from the authority's perspective the risk is there will be a confusion of interlocking engagements.  If the Commissioner has uncertainty as to whom he is accountable, there will also be uncertainty as to who ultimately is responsible for some of the elements.  There is a difference between accountability and giving account.  There is a risk the internal board, the Garda board, will have an oversight role that either duplicates or gets in the way of the oversight role of the proposed new PCSA.  As I said, there is value in having external expertise available to the Commissioner across a range of areas.  The authority has identified a number of those areas which are significant for the life of the organisation and which are essential to its effective performance and are not just back-office or administrative issues.  They are crucially, critically, central to the quality of the policing service.  That value is unquestioned.  It is about the interposition of that board and the potential dilution of the clarity of the oversight.<\/p> <p>  My final comment on this is the authority from its inception has made it absolutely clear it does not want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to create material simply for our existence.  It is giving the authority access to material that is already there.  There has never been a suggestion that the authority wanted to be part of the executive management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, let alone micromanage it.  That is not our role.

That is not the only issue that concerns the authority and where it saw a shifting back from the position established just over six years ago.  A range of responsibilities returned to the Minister.  We were very pleased to see the setting of the priorities that was going to be with the Minister in the initial draft heads is now going to be with the new authority, as it is with the current authority.  It is a very positive development and we welcomed it.  The setting of those priorities is done in close consultation with the Garda Commissioner, as the law requires, and it always has been.  There has not been an instance, either in the setting of priorities or the approval of the policing plan, where there has been a significant difference between the authority and the Garda Commissioner.<\/p> <p>  The return to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na family, as it were, which includes the new board and which will adopt the services plan or the policing plan, as it is called, is a step backwards.  The authority has always been strongly of the view that the policing plan must be the Garda Commissioner's plan and he or she must own it.  The entire organisation must own it.  The fact that the authority approves it currently is a really significant element because the authority brings to that process all its engagements across the community, including outreach.  There is very significant evidence, for example, during the past 18 or 20 months of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 15 reports that the authority has submitted to the Minister on the policing of that.  There have been very positive responses from the public to the authority on the quality of that policing service.  That element runs the risk of being absent from the shaping of the new services plan.<\/p> <p>  As I am on the topic of the services plan, there is a provision in it that merits further serious consideration.  It relates to the final subhead in the part, which indicates the services plan must align with the policy of the Government or of any Minister of the Government and his or her views on policing.  It is difficult to understand that and it has the potential to be problematic for the independence of any Garda Commissioner in setting the policing plan.<\/p> <p>  To get back to the point, it is proposed the board will adopt that plan but it is not clear what exactly is the difference between \"adopt\", \"approve\", \"accept\" or whatever it may be.  The appointments are a critical matter.  Moving the appointments from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the independent oversight body was not an invasion of the executive management space of the Garda Commissioner because the Garda Commissioner had the capacity, either personally or through a representative, to be involved with every selection process that was undertaken.  The current Garda Commissioner has been involved with the selection of deputy and assistant commissioners, as well as chief superintendents.  That is really positive.<\/p> <p>  The critical point is that there was a serious reservation within the organisation about the appropriateness of recruitment policies and the independence of recruitment practices.  That was reflected very significantly in the culture.  The response to the authority over the past four or five years in which it has had this responsibility is welcome for the fact this external body was engaged.  There is a virtue in having the authority as opposed to the Public Appointments Service involved.  My comments are not in the slightest sense to cast any aspersions or doubts on the professionalism of that important agency.  The authority, by virtue of its various responsibilities, has access to understanding the information because of its statutory entitlements and powers that would not be readily available to any other agency involved with the appointments process.  That really shifts the balance towards the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an entity.<\/p> <p>  This is not about any individual Garda Commissioner or officer, and I have no doubt the people in question know that.  This is about the structural relationships between the policing service as an entity and whatever oversight body exists.  We all know there will be an oversight body.  The Garda Commissioner knows this from his previous experience in another jurisdiction of an oversight body with a far more significant capacity that this authority.  The virtue and value of that has been appreciated by the chief constables of the Policing Service of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I share the concerns outlined by Mr. Collins.

That is in the new Bill, and that will be true for the Policing and Community Safety Authority, PCSA, as it is for the current Policing Authority.

It seems unreasonable that a commissioner would do it twice.  There is a risk therefore that this would diminish the extent to which those engagements would be properly and fully held with the Policing Authority.  There is a risk that Garda board, with its fiduciary responsibilities to the organisation, will want to protect jealously its own area of statutory responsibility, and there may be an emerging reluctance to engage with the kind of increasing openness that has been evident from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with some notable exceptions, over the past five to six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>To be clear, does Mr. Collins feel that the board meets that criteria that he has set out there to be public, external, strong, and statutorily supported?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#F00600","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634684400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>In many respects, yes.

There is an issue that head 11 and head 104 are replications of each other.  Head 11 says that the Garda board is said to be responsible for monitoring organisational performance, while head 104 says that the Policing Authority keeps under review the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na functions.  As the chair of the Policing Authority has already suggested, there is a role for a Garda board as a support in terms of internal management governance and expertise to me as the Commissioner and to the senior team in dealing with a very complex organisation.  We have an effective dual employment model with regard to Garda staff and Garda members.  We are the sole policing service for Ireland, and we have a wide range of responsibilities including, almost uniquely, national security responsibilities.  The board would be a valuable addition for our management and organisational effectiveness.  The difficulty is, however, and I believe that the chairman and I are not very divergent in our views here, that when the new authority is assessing the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's functions, is the board assessing my performance or that of the board and the decisions it has made?  Within this, it starts to actually dilute.  If the responsibility does not lie with me then authority seeps away from me in terms of the changes and driving the formal and operational agendas within the organisation.<\/p><p>Obviously, we too understand that public confidence is wrapped up in our accountability mechanism.  We are supportive of an accountability mechanism.  We are supportive of the public accountability mechanism and we recognise that we are very different from every other public body in the State in having a very regular public accountability exercise with both the authority and Oireachtas committees.  However, I think there is confusion as to who is looking after what here between the board and the authority, and that could be clarified.

We are at opposite ends of the same Christmas cracker; the question is who will get the hat.  I think some of those issues can be relatively easily resolved within the architecture.  There were two other elements in respect of which the authority felt there was perhaps an imbalance in the way the focus was on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We may come to community safety.  It is a critical part of the Bill and tends to be but should not be overlooked.  This makes very clear arrangements for the way in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be held to account in respect of its engagement with community safety.  As everybody recognises, however, this is a shared responsibility, and it is not altogether clear - perhaps it will be reflected in other legislation - that a similarly focused arrangement will emerge whereby the other relevant public institutions will have the same level of scrutiny or be held to account to the same extent as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is.<\/p> <p>  The second concern we had - again, lest we not come to it otherwise - is that, while we do not have a huge amount to say about the arrangements for the proposed office of the Garda ombudsman, there is a genuine concern that the issue of incidents of concern and the need to report virtually all of them to the proposed office of the Garda ombudsman may diminish the emerging acceptance of the notion of performance management within the organisation which, undoubtedly, the Commissioner and his senior colleagues wish to see become the norm and widespread.  If everything about which the Commissioner has a concern has to be referred externally, it may give the impression that there is little that can be done internally.  That will not be the case, but perceptions can be very powerful in this respect.  As for the existence of a board, a board could be tremendously powerful and useful to the Commissioner in respect of a whole range of things but I think they could be dealt with relatively simply in order that there is greater clarity for everybody concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I now move to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#G00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Chair, I do not know how I am fixed for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#G00500","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>You are out of time, Senator, unfortunately, unless you wish to make a brief comment.

When people know they have to go along and either they or their immediate supervisor will present the cases they prepare, there is a real connection between the quality of the work and they then see the immediate impact of that in a court appearance.  That is also a good grounding for moving on into more serious crime investigation and being very familiar with court processes.  There is, therefore, a downside and a skills fade when a policing organisation no longer takes on those prosecutions.  I understand the point the commission made and I know that work is being done but, at the same time, a huge resource would be required to conduct that function right across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I asked about the difference in the culture between the North and this jurisdiction.

They should then be investigated by the ombudsman.  We believe it is vitally important that the new ombudsman is given greater powers and resources, considering the need has been identified not only by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland but also by international bodies.  The UN Committee against Torture, in its most recent report to Ireland, recommended a strengthening of the powers of the Garda ombudsman.

The specific question that I have relates to an incident in August 2020, when the then EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, was cautioned for using a mobile phone while driving at the time that he was having a bit of a dispute with the Government.  He was not caught with a bag of Kalashnikovs in the boot.  There was no great threat to State security or anything like that.  He was caught with a mobile phone in his hand.  We were subsequently told that the Commissioner brought this to the attention of the Minister for justice.  She brought it to Cabinet and the Cabinet duly used it to get rid of a Commissioner that they were under political pressure to get rid of to save their own hides.  Of course, every offence is potentially serious.  Receiving a caution for using a mobile phone while driving is not the most serious criminal offence and certainly is not the most serious road traffic offence.

That does not diminish in the slightest the engagement the Commissioner would have or, as the authority has always insisted, the ownership the Commissioner would have.  As currently drafted, the proposed legislation provides that the Commissioner invites the policing and community safety authority, PCSA, to express its views on what the service plan should contain.  The risk in that is that it makes it appear that the new authority is an agent of the Commissioner in that respect and can act only on foot of receiving the request from the Commissioner.  That inverts or certainly distorts the relationship of distance and detachment that should exist between the Commissioner and the relevant oversight body.<\/p> <p>  If the Government persists with this notion and the Oireachtas enacts the provision as it is at the moment, that is to say, that it is not the new authority that develops the policing plan or service plan, then at the very least, it should be provided that the authority's initial intervention in the process is done out of its own statutory capacity, rather than at the invitation of the Commissioner.  That is not just a semantic point, less still is it umbrage or sitting on a high horse.  It is a meaningfully different arrangement if the authority does it from its own statutory power, as opposed to possibly being perceived as acting as an agent of the Commissioner and only on the Commissioner's request, even if that request is statutorily mandated.  That is not an unimportant issue and the same applies to the strategic plan.  In any event, the notion that policy priorities or a policing plan would be developed without engagement with the Commissioner is a nonsense.  The current statute requires that engagement.  It is a clearer statement of the independence and externality of the oversight if it is done in such a way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021102000002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1634684400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>That concludes our second round of engagement and our deliberations for this session.
