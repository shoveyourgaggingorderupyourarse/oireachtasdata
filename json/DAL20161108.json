Today there are secondary schools closed across the country.  It is happening for a number of reasons, including fundamentally because there was a failure to engage early and effectively on the secondary school strikes and the situation pertaining to the ASTI and the issues it had raised.  The first issue relates to equal pay for newly qualified teachers.  For some reason, the Government has not committed publicly to finding a pathway towards equal pay for newly qualified teachers, which would go a long way towards dealing with the issue, on which the TUI and the INTO made progress.  I warned last week that the system might have wanted to punish the ASTI for staying outside the Lansdowne Road agreement and said it should resist that temptation, but it has not.  We are now in a situation where feelings are becoming more entrenched and resolving the dispute could become more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue, in terms of yesterday's closure of secondary schools, relates to substitution and supervision.  The ASTI is looking for flexibility on the Croke Park agreement hours, on which some flexibility has been shown to the TUI and the INTO.  I support the Lansdowne Road agreement and accept that everything has to be resolved under it, but there is provision in it for flexibility on the Croke Park agreement hours.  Before any Lansdowne Road or Croke Park agreement was made, teachers had been engaged in extracurricular activities for a long time.  There are many good teachers who are brassed off when officialdom tells them to pencil in this and that because, frankly, they have been doing it for years when it comes to sport, music, debating and cultural activities.  We should keep this fact at the backs of our heads.  That contribution by teachers has always been made.  The issue of substitution and supervision can be dealt with if there is the will to do so and there is a way under the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>  <p>  My third point is that leaving certificate and junior certificate students are suffering too much.  They are the real victims of this industrial dispute.  We know about the centrality of the leaving certificate examinations and how difficult and challenging it is for any student in his or her leaving certificate year.  The absence of contingency planning led to the closures yesterday when teachers turned up for work but the gates were locked.  The argument was made that schools did not have enough supervisors to provide cover, but it was within the capacity of school managements to open the schools to examination students, particularly leaving certificate students.  There would not have been health and safety issues in the teaching of leaving certificate students.  That is an important point because today students are very pressurised.<\/p><p>A greater effort should have been made, in terms of contingency planning, to open the schools for examination students, in particular.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there was a failure on the Government and management side in providing for adequate contingency measures to facilitate the opening of schools yesterday?  I ask him to indicate when that issue will be resolved.  I also ask him to indicate whether he is prepared to give a commitment on the issue of equal pay for newly qualified teachers in finding a pathway to a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478613900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>First, I am disappointed that the strike has continued.  I can confirm for the Deputy that it is not anybody's intention that the system should penalise ASTI members.  There are four industrial disputes involving the ASTI and the Department of Education and Skills.  In respect of the first, the question of equal pay for new entrants, this issue has been the subject of long hours of negotiations by the Department and the Minister within the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Deputy is aware of the increased opportunities to secure permanent positions and increases in pay, ranging from 15% to 22%, for new entrant teachers, as applies in the case of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI.  The Minister has spoken at some length about equality and what it actually means.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding supervision and substitution, the Deputy seems to be suggesting schools or their boards of management should be pressurised into supplying personnel who would have to be vetted in order that schools could open.  However, he is aware that the ASTI prevented school principals from engaging in that way, which creates a difficulty.  Those who are suffering most are the 220,000 students, particularly those in junior and leaving certificate examination classes who do not have their teachers teaching them.  The issue arose because, as a union, the ASTI decided unilaterally to reject working an extra one hour per week.  It is true that for years, in all grades of teaching and many other public services, people gave of their time voluntarily, over and above the stipulated hours.  However, in this dispute teachers are turning up for work but the schools cannot open because of health and safety regulations.  Money is on the table to pay those teachers who want to teach.  The issue of substitution and supervision is one that could be resolved very quickly, which would mean that teachers would receive their payments, schools could open, pupils could be taught, parents would not be discommoded and teachers would also be able to do the job they set out to do.  <\/p>  <p>  The three remaining disputes are under negotiation.  In respect of new entrant pay levels, substantial money is on the table and the benefits are available to ASTI members, tjo those teachers who need the money.  We are only a few weeks away from Christmas and this is not by any means ideal.  I hope the talks that are taking place will continue and that a conclusion can be reached pretty quickly in order that schools can reopen, that there will be supervision and substitution and that the payments on the table can be made to teachers.  I hope the benefits achieved in the discussions that have taken place and been successfully concluded with the TUI and the INTO on new entrants' pay could also apply to the ASTI.  <\/p>  <p>  The two remaining disputes require further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1478613900,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Hoping will not solve it or get it sorted.<\/p>  <p>  On supervision and substitution, in some schools one is only talking about 100 leaving certificate students and in others, 80 or 60.  While some schools may have more than 100, the Taoiseach cannot tell me that it was not within the capacity of school managers to facilitate the opening of schools to teach these students.  This is a serious issue because students get lost in the debate.  They are the pawns in between, but there is only one year in which a student does the leaving certificate examinations.  Whether one likes, they are crucial examinations in terms of the future development of young people and their career opportunities.  There is complete uncertainty and nobody can give them a clear pathway to the resumption of their courses and studies.  It was within the capacity of management to keep schools open, but my suspicion is that the Department and the Government decided to bring the dispute to a head and allow teachers to go out.  That is why there was no will to keep schools open and sort out the supervision and substitution issue, particularly for examination students.<\/p><p>If there was an issue with 500, I could accept that.  However, I question the point that it was not within the capacity of schools to open to facilitate the teaching of leaving certificate students.  <\/p> <p> In respect of newly qualified teachers and equal pay, the Minister of State, Deputy English, said last week on \"Claire Byrne Live\" that it will happen in the successor agreement.  Every Minister is nodding their head and saying it will happen.  Why can the Government not say it publicly?  I understand the Minister said it previously so why can the Government not say that there is a pathway to equality of pay for newly qualified teachers?  It may be in the successor agreement but at least, there is a timeframe, commitment and pathway.  This would go a long way towards getting this sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800004#B00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478614200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is not just a case of hoping it will resolve itself because it will not.  It will only be resolved through continuation of the bilateral talks that are taking place between officials on both sides.  As the Deputy is aware, the president of the ASTI made a comment about the WRC.  Whether or not the WRC becomes involved is a matter for it.  This is a dispute that must be settled.  A situation where over 220,000 students and their parents are discommoded and teachers are left without pay is not a proper one.  The situation pertaining to supervision and substitution resulted from the direct and unilateral action of the ASTI in the summer not to work the extra hour per week, which I regret.  This matter can be resolved quickly.  I hope there is a willingness to see an end to this dispute that would allow the money on the table to be paid to the teachers, the pupils to be taught and the schools to get on with their business.  The remaining element of the benefits that come from the collective situation are available to ASTI teachers who need them now.  I trust that the continued bilateral discussions that are taking place will lead to that conclusion quickly.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's question is a valid one but it is one that should not have arisen.  I do not accept that the Government, the Minister and the Department were lax in not dealing with this.  This has dragged on for quite some time but the one hour not being worked results from a unilateral decision made by the ASTI that has affected its own members to their detriment.

This represents 70% of the secondary school sector.  A total of 250,000 students are affected.  Tens of thousands of them are in examination years, including the leaving certificate.  They are missing out on valuable course work and their family schedules and routines are up in the air.  It also affects thousands of teachers who have made it very clear that they would rather be in their classrooms instead of on picket lines.  Yesterday, they were effectively locked out of their workplaces.  They are engaged in industrial action because of very legitimate concerns about their pay and conditions.  Those concerns are shared across the public sector following seven years of pay cuts.  The Taoiseach should know this as a former teacher.  It has particularly impacted because this was one area in the public sector in which there was a large number of new recruits over the past ten years.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of pay equality cannot be dodged and must be addressed.  It is very simple and straightforward - equal pay for equal work.  In 2016, surely the Government can accept that basic principle but not one Minister is prepared to agree to the principle of pay equality let alone set out a timetable for when it might be achieved.  Young teachers are earning up to &euro;8,000 less per year than their colleagues who were hired before 2012.  Is that fair?  Clearly, it is not about equality but it is obviously acceptable to the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Even though garda&iacute; have to vote on the package, last week's negotiations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na surely show that the issues at play are not insurmountable.  Agreement can be reached.  What is required is a meaningful dialogue that sets out a clear and sensible path to the provision of pay equality.  The Taoiseach knows that this cannot wait until 2018.  A new pay agreement is needed.  The Lansdowne Road agreement is clearly cr&iacute;ochnaithe and must be replaced.<\/p><p>The issue of allowances also has to be dealt with.  That would go a long way towards satisfying teachers' concerns.  It is obvious that pay equality needs to be put in place sooner rather than later.  Putting it on the long finger as Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have done so many times in the past will not resolve the issue.  Will the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, accept the principle of pay equality?  He should accept it without equivocation.  Will the Government open dialogue with the ASTI on that basis?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Lansdowne Road agreement must be replaced with a new agreement that sets out a clear timetable for having a single pay scale for all public sector workers and the restoration of allowances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800005#C00300","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478614500,"counter":14,"content":"<p>On supervision and substitution, at the heart of that industrial dispute is the withdrawal by the ASTI from working an extra hour per week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800006#D00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1478614500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>It does not cover supervision and substitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800006#D00300","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1478614500,"counter":16,"content":"<p>What was working that extra hour about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800006#D00400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1478614500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach knows that it is a lie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800006#D00500","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1478614500,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800006#D00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1478614500,"counter":19,"content":"<p>In many cases it was about arranging parent-teacher meetings in such a way that they could be held outside school hours, which would have accommodated everybody, as well as supervision in corridors, schoolyards and so on.

The Irish Coast Guard is the only primary response agency that is not legislated for in the State.  The Irish Coast Guard is the fourth blue light service and it needs to be a stand-alone, legislated, primary response agency.  The current system within which it operates impedes the growth and progress of the service as decisions are being made by managers in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport who have no direct involvement with the emergency service.  A stand-alone legislated, primary response agency would have a chain of command structure filled by qualified and experienced coast guard personnel as is the case in the other three legislated primary response agencies within the State.<\/p>  <p>  The main role of the Irish Coast Guard is to rescue people from dangerous seas, inland waters, mountains and caves, to organise immediate medical assistance and transport and to assist boats and ships within the State's jurisdiction.  In any one year the Irish Coast Guard expects to handle around 2,500 maritime emergencies, assist approximately 4,500 people and save the lives of some 200 people.  It will task coast guard helicopters on missions some 800 times, evacuate medical patients from the islands to hospitals on 100 occasions, assist other nations' coast guard services approximately 200 times and make nearly 6,000 maritime safety broadcasts to shipping, fishing and leisure craft users.  The coast guard's role in our State cannot be underestimated.  The crews of over 950 male and female volunteers are real life heroes.  Currently, there are only three sector managers for the entire State.  They have a combined job of managing all coastal units, which is a near impossible task.  A minimum of another six sector manager positions and at least nine assistant sector manager positions need to be made available immediately in order to provide the support required and deserved by the coast guard volunteer coastal unit.  In my own area in west Cork our coast guards in Goleen, Toe Head, Kinsale and Castletownbere are always ready to respond to calls, as are their colleagues throughout the State, to rescue cliff walkers, to search for missing persons or to assist in search operations, such as the infamous cocaine seizure in Dunlough Bay in west Cork in 2007.<\/p><p>I ask that legislation be enacted as soon as possible to protect the Coast Guard and ensure the future of the world class organisation which volunteers have worked so hard to develop.

It is very much appreciated by the people and the Government will continue to support it.  Twenty or 30 years ago these services were in their infancy and had very inferior facilities and capacity.  It is very different now.  While, unfortunately, accidents and tragedies happen at sea all of the time the Coast Guard service is one which stands up to the highest international standards and we will continue to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800008#F00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1478615400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>We both agree the Irish Coast Guard is one of the most progressive search and rescue organisations in the world.

It is fair to say the Coast Guard service is very professional and operates to very high standards in terms of its training, its use of equipment, and the on-call situation it has as volunteers.  Legislating for volunteers is certainly not an exact science.  Deputy Collins can take it the Government and the Minister are very amenable to discussing these issues with the Coast Guard service.  I recently advised it to send in its propositions on this and in other regards.  From the Government's point of view, not only do we value the service but we will continue to fund it where we can to improve the level of services and facilities it has and its capacity to do its job.

There is only one industrial relations agreement between the Department of Education and Skills and the ASTI and that is the Haddington Road agreement, freely entered into by the Department of Education and teachers.  Except where that agreement explicitly states otherwise, the agreement expired last 30 June.  Crucially, a key area where the agreement extends into the future is that of supervision and substitution and how these are to be paid for.  The agreement states that:<\/p><blockquote>A gross additional payment equivalent to the 2011 lower payment rate paid for supervision and substitution will be included in the common basic scale for teachers.  This will be included in two moieties with half included in the school year 2016\/17 and the second half included in the school year 2017\/18.<\/blockquote><p>Teachers turned up for work to teach but the Taoiseach and his Minister broke their agreement by refusing to pay for substitution and supervision.  They closed schools, locked out teachers and locked out students rather than honouring an agreement that they freely entered into.  They are prepared to pay parents, citizens and members of another union in the same school but they are not prepared to honour the agreement they freely made with the ASTI.  <br\/><br\/>Clearly this is not a question of money.  It is an attempt to coerce and bully a union into a new agreement and Mussolini, Franco and their Irish blueshirt ally, General O'Duffy, would be proud of the Taoiseach and his Government today.  His claim that the ASTI has unilaterally withdrawn from Croke Park hours is completely false.  The Haddington Road agreement makes no provision for the maintenance of these hours beyond 30 June and, as the Taoiseach well knows, the majority of teachers do additional hours far in excess of Croke Park on an ongoing basis to support and develop students in music, arts, drama, sports, transitional year projects, etc.  In any event the Croke Park hours have not been worked for months and this has not necessitated the closure of schools.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach and his Government are breaking the Haddington Road agreement.  They are locking out teachers and using students as pawns to bully the ASTI into an agreement.  Will the Taoiseach stop breaking the Haddington Road agreement, pay for supervision and substitution and allow our students and children back to school?  Will he and his Government stop locking out teachers and holding students as hostages to force a trade union into an agreement to which it is not party and which union members have rejected?  The Taoiseach should leave William Martin Murphy, the infamous Dublin employer who locked out workers in 1913, in his grave.  He can stop the lock-out today to allow teachers and students back to work and he should allow the right to free trade unions in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800008#F00500","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478615700,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Deputy Finian McGrath is looking uneasy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800009#G00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1478615700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Deputy is going well when he can bring William Martin Murphy and General O'Duffy into the dispute.

The problem is not one which has been caused by the Minister, but he will what he can to assist in bringing about a solution because we all want to see schools open, teachers teaching their students and students having the opportunity to learn and do their work, particularly those who will be doing their junior and leaving certificate examinations in June next year.  The leaving certificate examinations will not be long in coming around again and students will need all of the time they can get for projects and doing other work with their teachers during class hours.  This is an element which is causing serious difficulty because people do not know when schools will be open again.

Obviously, the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, met the public service committee of the ICTU and today sees the first meeting of the Public Service Pay Commission.  This morning the Government obviously considered this issue.  Following a discussion on the Labour Court's recommendations issued last week and pay policy more broadly, it reiterated its commitment to a collective approach to industrial relations and pay policy.  It will have to reflect on the most effective means of delivering economic security and stability for the country.  Clearly, the Lansdowne Road agreement is a central part of this and the Government will continue to stand by it.  In the context of the Labour Court's findings, the recommendations will require careful consideration by the Government also.  That is why the Minister met the public service committee of the ICTU.

In parallel with whatever work he was doing on that Bill, I was working to update a similar Bill that I had submitted last December, namely, the Prohibition of Hydraulic Fracturing Bill 2015.  I withdrew it from the lottery because it had become clear in the aftermath of events in Antrim that the definition of hydraulic fracturing did not necessarily cover other forms of unconventional extraction of hydrocarbons that essentially were fracking or paved the way for it.  Like Deputy Tony McLoughlin, I was working with Friends of the Earth, An Taisce and other groups to refine the Bill to make it more specific and allow it to catch up with technological developments.<\/p><p>I am happy with Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill, as I signalled to him two weeks ago.  I commend him, including for giving a voice to campaigners in his area and environmental campaigners generally who are fighting to ensure we will rule out any possibility of engaging in hydraulic fracturing.  However, there is a small difference between his Bill and mine.  Actually, it is a significant difference and I suspect that he will probably agree with me.  If we have moved towards an agreement or a consensus that we should rule out hydraulic fracturing onshore, as I hope we have, that prohibition should apply offshore also.  That is the additional feature of my Bill.<\/p><p>I do not intend to add my Bill to the lottery at this point.  We will see how the debate goes on Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on Committee Stage when I hope he and the Government will be open to an amendment to include the offshore in the prohibition of hydraulic fracturing and unconventional extraction.  The reason is simple.  Human health, the impact on the environment and the need to address climate change were the three key issues on which the House seemed to agree were at stake in trying to ban hydraulic fracturing.  The evidence suggests human health, the environment and water will be adversely affected by hydraulic fracturing and that there is no justification, particularly in the light of our Paris Declaration commitments to address climate change urgently, for extracting more hydrocarbons or finding new ways to do so.  If that is true onshore, self-evidently, i tis true offshore also.<\/p><p>A further important concern people have raised is seismic impacts, for example, the potential for earthquakes to occur and so on.  There is considerable evidence that this technology can contribute to earthquakes and that it has done so.<\/p><p>The precautionary principle that was cited in the debate about hydraulic fracturing onshore needs to apply to hydraulic fracturing offshore also.  Our offshore territorial waters are a precious resource, just as our land resources are.  All of the reasons that have been recounted - tourism, biodiversity, human habitats, animal habitats and so on - apply just as much offshore.  Any prohibition on fracking must, therefore, apply offshore.  It is in that context that I am submitting the Bill.  I hope including it in the lottery will not be necessary further down the road if the Government is open to accepting my amendment to Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on Committee Stage.  If it is not, I will try to press ahead with my Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800016#P01700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478618700,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Is

The dialogue was the first in a series of sessions to discuss both the challenges and the opportunities arising from Brexit on an all-island basis.  It was an open and inclusive event, bringing together around 300 people from all parts of the island of Ireland, representing a broad range of civic society groups, trade unions, business groups and non-governmental organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the constructive engagement of those who attended from political parties, North and South, including many from this House.  I was also impressed by the quality of the interventions from across civic society, from large business groups to local and community representatives from Border areas.  I was struck by the appetite of the audience and participants for deeper consultation and engagement.  As I said during my remarks at the event, this is just the first part of an ongoing dialogue.  We need more detailed discussions across a number of specific themes and sectors which will form the next phase of our dialogue.  We will hold a number of sectoral consultations in the coming weeks and months and I will convene another all-island civic dialogue in plenary format early next year.<\/p>  <p>  During my remarks at the dialogue I noted that the Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, had indicated that she would trigger Article 50 by no later than the end of March but that this did not preclude her from taking this action at an earlier date.<\/p><p>That was a simple statement of fact at the time, although the subsequent ruling of the High Court on the role of Parliament on Article 50 reduces the likelihood of an earlier notification.<\/p> <p> I will continue to update the Members of the House on Brexit related issues through a range of methods, including weekly responses to parliamentary questions and Leader's Questions, regular briefings for party leaders, as required, making statements to the House before and after European Council meetings and making statements to the House itself, as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800016#P03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478619300,"counter":182,"content":"<p>To follow up on the Taoiseach's comments on Article 50 and when it would be triggered, he seems to be rowing back somewhat from the comments that were reported in terms of a real possibility that it could be triggered earlier than March and even before the end of this year.  In particular, I ask the Taoiseach for his opinion on the latest developments on Brexit in Britain in the context of the decision of the High Court.  Does the Taoiseach agree that while it is appropriate that the British Parliament should discuss a mandate for the Brexit negotiations for the British Government and that there should be such a democratic discussion and accountability of the British Government to the British Parliament, it would be absolutely wrong for the Parliament or the courts to act to try to subvert or deny the wishes of the people, as expressed in the referendum, to exit the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800017#Q00200","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1478619300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government for holding last week's civic dialogue.  I also thank all those who organised the event which ran very smoothly.  It was informative, wide ranging and many voices expressed their opinion on Brexit.  While the Unionist parties did not participate, I am certain they were listening to what was discussed at the forum.  I am sure they are still listening to what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  What is going on is not very good, as we all appreciate, for the people of this island, whatever our position may be on the constitutional issue.  Monday's report by the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, reveals some of the very real dangers.  The report finds that a so-called hard Brexit would permanently damage the economy, reducing its size by almost 4% and increasing unemployment by as much as 2%.  It goes on to give some detail around all this.  I know that there is currently a short-term gain for retailers in the North, which I am sure is welcome in places like Enniskillen, Derry and Newry but that will be short-lived and will ultimately lead to inflation and an increase in the cost of living for citizens in the North.<\/p>  <p>  How do we combat all this?  The Taoiseach should give us more meat in terms of the plans and the next steps in the programme for the civic dialogue.  He has not gone any further today but has simply told us that it will meet again next year.  We need to have more detail, particularly about the notion of moving the conference throughout the island.<\/p>  <p>  I was at a disability rights conference in north Louth recently, organised by Ms Martina Anderson, MEP.  An issue was raised there which I had not thought about previously.  It was very clear that the rights of people with disabilities, which are now legislatively based, will be done away with if the British, or rather the English, Government leaves the European Union and drags the North with it.  This is another issue of grave concern.<\/p>  <p>  The last time we discussed this matter I asked the Taoiseach whether he had asked Prime Minister May about the implications for the Good Friday Agreement post-Brexit.  I particularly asked if the Taoiseach had asked her about the Human Rights Act but he did not answer me.  He just ignored the question entirely.  Later the journalist Justine McCarthy asked the same question and the Taoiseach on that occasion told her that he had not raised the issue with Prime Minister May.  I congratulate Justine McCarthy for being able to get the answer that I was not able to get.  The Taoiseach also said that he did not have enough time but I would suggest that he did not make it a priority.  That is part of the problem.  This Government does not have the imagination, vision or investment in the process of political change on the island, particularly arising from the Good Friday Agreement.  We must raise these issues and we look to the Taoiseach to do so.  He must stand up for people in the Six Counties who expressed their vote.  They have not given their consent to being dragged out of the European Union at the whim of a right-wing government in London.  I ask the Taoiseach if he has had the opportunity to raise any of these matters relating to the Good Friday Agreement with the British.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach been briefed on the recent High Court decision in London and its implications?  That decision came the day after the Taoiseach's comment to the effect that he thought that the British Prime Minister might trigger Brexit before March.  Has the Government been briefed on this issue?  Has the Taoiseach raised any of these crucially important issues, which as equal co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, he is obliged to protect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800017#Q00300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1478619300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I feel the civic forum went well.  The participation of stakeholders in business and farming and the raising of workers' issues, trade unions and so on was quite effective.  However, if it is to be a true dialogue, it must continue and we must get down to specifics with the various sectors that are represented.  The potential impact on the academic and research communities is, for example, a very real issue, as is the concern around North-South interactions and the all-island economy.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard various fears expressed by different sectors, but I am not clear on what the Government's response will be.  It is interesting to note that the more one looks at the budget, the more one sees that it failed to make any adequate provision of substance for Brexit.  When one reads last month's publications from the Department of Finance on the sectors that are exposed to Brexit and yesterday's report from the Department and the ESRI, one sees that even in the context of a so-called soft Brexit, there will be down side repercussions for Irish economic growth, GDP and employment unless action is taken.  We need to move into the space of putting it to our European colleagues that direct aid will be needed for some industries.  The reports from the Department of Finance indicate that traditional manufacturing will be under threat, the regions outside of Dublin will be badly hit and the Border regions will be hit hardest by a hard Brexit or even a soft Brexit.  The Department identifies particular sectors that are at risk including farming, agrifood, traditional manufacturing, tourism and others.  The thinking cap should have been on with regard to what will be required in the next year or so and then in the aftermath of Brexit actually happening.  Are scenarios being prepared in terms of the supports that the Government may have to provide to transition certain SMEs out of trouble, that is, those which are heavily reliant on the British market to sell their produce?  The same question applies in quite a number of other areas, including our VAT rate, for example.  <\/p>  <p>  We must accept the urgency of this because it is very serious.  Brexit fundamentally alters the economic model that we have been operating since the 1970s.  The model we have been working under for the last 45 to 50 years will be turned upside down by the decision of the British to leave the European Union unless Britain magically gets a Norway-type deal, with full access to the Single Market, without tariffs.  We would love to see such a deal, but we are not getting any sense of that happening right now; therefore, we need to prepare for the negative scenarios.  One can add into the mix the negative figures on income tax and the fact that retail sales are beginning to flatten out.<\/p><p>Manufacturing output in general is down again this month.  I accept that these are monthly figures but if you put it all together, there are significant challenges ahead.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he has approached the European Commission and pointed out these realities and the fact that intervention will be required?  Has he outlined or published his negotiating goals or principles in advance of any of this?  It is important that this would happen.  I would argue that maybe the time has come for us to have a meaningful discussion in this House about the measures we will be looking for to mitigate the impact of what has been a disastrous decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  It is time to talk substance.  There is a degree of superficiality in terms of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800017#Q00400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478619900,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I join others in commending the Taoiseach for facilitating the first \"open mic\" for all the different stakeholders who feel this momentous decision by the United Kingdom will impact on them.  I stayed for the full debate because I thought it was most important.  I agree with the Taoiseach that the impact of Brexit is probably the most serious issue we will face as a nation in our lifetime.  It will certainly be as challenging as the economic disaster we battled our way through for the past few years.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the first question on the Order Paper today, it is and has been important to allow all the social and economic actors in this State to have a voice and we need to continue to do this.  Fundamentally, we need a united clear voice in this House.  I am not reassured by the notion that the Taoiseach will be amenable to answer normal Leaders' Questions or take Topical Issues or anything else.  We need a structure.  We need some way in which the negotiating position of the 27 member states is impacted by the best interests of the people of this island, North and South, because as other speakers have said, nobody will be impacted as much as the people on this island.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to give me an answer now, but I ask him to reflect on how the Oireachtas can move into a different forum to ensure we deal with the issues of substance about which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin spoke.  We can all identify the challenges but we must scope out the best solutions and influence the negotiating position of the United Kingdom in the first instance.  One of the things that struck me in the debate at the forum was the notion that we would wait until negotiations start and somehow have a tripartite discussion involving the 26 member states, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It will not be like that.  It will be the United Kingdom with a set-out position and the European Commission negotiating for the 27 member states; therefore, we need to influence the opening positions of both the United Kingdom and the 27 member states before Article 50 is triggered.  I ask the Taoiseach to give serious consideration as to how we can as an Oireachtas deal with that issue.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gerry Adams asked whether there have been any specific briefings relating to the judgement of the UK High Court.  One issue many of us have talked about is the possibility that at the end of negotiation period of two or three years, the people of the United Kingdom will have the chance to vote again.  Implicit in the judgement was that once Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty is triggered, it is irrevocable.  Without treaty change, there is no comeback from this.  That is a fundamental issue.  Does the Taoiseach have legal advices that this is the position or will it ultimately be a determination of the European Court of Justice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800018#R00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1478619900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I could not attend the dialogue last week because I had a commitment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800018#R00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478619900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>The Deputy should not take too long because we have time restrictions and are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800018#R00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1478619900,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Brendan Howlin.

Insofar as the dialogue has started, is there recognition that one of the lessons of all of this is that our economy is not diversified enough and that it is too dependent on a couple of key sectors, notably beef?  I submitted a question that was not taken.

It is only 18 weeks to the end of March.  I would not want anybody to be complacent and wait until the last few days in March expecting that only then will the Prime Minister decide to trigger Article 50.  When I made that comment at the civic forum, what I had in mind was that we have no time to waste and that we should be looking at what we must discuss and get ready for.  At the time, it was the Prime Minister's right or it was assumed to be her right to trigger Article 50 whenever she thought it appropriate.  As that could be any time from December through to January or February, it might not be at the end of the March.  The UK High Court has made its ruling on the basis that only Parliament has the authority to trigger Article 50, which is the legal route out of the European Union for the United Kingdom and that this precludes the invoking of Article 50 by the Prime Minister or the Government under the royal prerogative, which gives it sole authority over foreign policy and the making and unmaking of treaties.  The High Court ruled that the European Communities Act 1972, which gives effect to the United Kingdom's EU membership, is a matter of domestic law and not foreign policy.  Everybody is aware that the British Government intends to appeal that ruling to the UK Supreme Court.  Arrangements have been made for that to happen in December.  I do not know what the outcome of that will be and whether the Supreme Court will support the High Court or come to a different decision.  I cannot say at this stage whether it will upset the timescale set out by the Prime Minister.  She contends that Article 50 will still be triggered by the end of March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gerry Adams mentioned the fact that the Unionist parties did not participate in the civic forum.  I met Mike Nesbitt, MLA, in Stormont and hope to meet the First Minister, Arlene Foster, MLA, on Sunday in Enniskillen before the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 18 November.  I am sure everybody is listening to this debate.  I thought that the ESRI report on a Norway or Swiss-style operation or a WTO arrangement spoke for itself in that if the Government was to do nothing, the implications would be very serious.  The Government will do what it can.  Our priorities remain the economy, jobs, the situation in Northern Ireland, the peace process, Border and citizenship issues, the common travel area and so on.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Gerry Adams, it will be important to move some of the sectoral and thematic issues out from Dublin.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, I was in Carlingford, Blackrock, Dundalk and Newry recently.  At one of the meetings of the Brexit conference yesterday, we agreed to go to Newry for the next thematic session which will involve education and research.  We will set out a timetable throughout the country, North and South, for those thematic issues.  We will have a further plenary session early in the new year.  I have been invited by the Newry Junior Chamber and the Newry Chamber of Commerce &amp;amp; Trade to go back to Newry and I intend to take up that opportunity.  I have made the point that the Government will continue its co-guarantorship requirement in respect of the Good Friday Agreement.  I understand that has been reiterated by different British Ministers.<\/p> <p> Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is right.  We discussed a number of sectoral areas, including energy, the agrifood sector, hospitality, education and research, water, and human rights.  Following yesterday's meeting of the Brexit committee, all these themes and sectors will be outlined and we will decide where they should be held around the country and in the North, followed by a plenary session afterwards.<\/p> <p> I made the point about the Brexit committee.  I have had to deal with questions about whether to appoint a Minister for this or a Minister for that.  This is a national challenge for everybody.  For that reason I recall back in 1969 when Jack Lynch - God rest him - was standing here, they had several options about how to deal with the challenge then.  In this case it is about Ireland, the people, the economy and our future.  It should be led by the Taoiseach, the Department of the Taoiseach with everybody involved.  Let us figure out a way here of having everybody discuss here.  We could devote an hour and a half or two hours every week to Brexit; I do not mind.  We could set up an Oireachtas committee to deal with it.  It is appropriate that the party leaders should be briefed regularly.  If they require information individually it should and will be given to them because they each need to be able to talk to their people in Brussels.  In that sense these things are important.<\/p> <p> What we know is as follows.  First, Article 50 will be triggered by the end of March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800018#R01100","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478620500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Not December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800019#S00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1478620500,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Second, there will be no return to a hard Border.

They were from the third level sector, the academic sector, businesses and the farming community in the context of the the CAP ultimately.  Hardly anyone is cheering from the sidelines and even those who voted for Brexit realise deep down that there will be a real impact.  It was not the right tone for the First Minister to set.  She said her relationship with Dublin was great, but the Taoiseach did not meet her last week.  There does not appear to be any urgency to the relationship between the First Minister and the Government in Dublin.  It is now four months since the referendum on Brexit and the level of direct contact has been ridiculously small, either for the political optics from the DUP's perspective or from what else I do not know, but something needs to change.  The issue is too serious for the people on the island of Ireland to have that low level of contact; it is at the same level it was before the vote.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might indicate if it is the DUP's demand that Brexit be discussed at the North-South Ministerial Council?  If it is, we have to make sure the Council will meet more often than it does.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the twice a year format is clearly not adequate and has he requested a new time table for meetings of the Council?

It will be the only land border in the European Union with the United Kingdom if and when it actually leaves the Union.  On top of this, the process is embellished by the United States and the European Union with PEACE funds and INTERREG funds, through cross-Border activities, health and education co-operation.  I point out to the House that letters of offer have issued in respect of INTERREG and PEACE funds and that 17 major projects will continue, as we expect, in the coming years with substantial moneys from the European Union.

It will encompass both universal and targeted elements which can be incrementally expanded over time.  International evidence indicates that systems based on universalism are associated with lower rates of child poverty and deliver better outcomes for all children, with disadvantaged children benefiting more when services are provided within a universal programme design.  Progressive universalism further recognises the importance of the provision of additional support for those with the greatest need.<\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for the targeted aspect of the new scheme is based on net parental income and the highest levels of support will be offered to those on the lowest incomes.  It is fairer and more accessible than the current targeted subsidy programmes, under which many low income families are not currently able to access subsidised child care because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain State benefits or attending certain training programmes.  It will also enhance targeted schemes.<\/p><p>For example, a person in receipt of the maximum level of subsidy under the current community child care scheme, which is by far the largest of the current targeted schemes, might face a weekly co-payment of &euro;89 per week.  Under the new scheme, a person in receipt of the maximum rate of subsidy will have an average weekly co-payment of about &euro;12 per week.<\/p> <p> The universal subsidy for children under three recognises that the cost of child care is generally highest when children are under three years of age and this cost can result in many parents having to stop work outside the home when paid maternity leave ends.  Recent reports also suggest that cost and sustainability issues are affecting the availability of child care places for children under three years.<\/p> <p> Finally, the Deputy has also asked about families above the income cut-off for targeted subsidies.  While all targeted schemes, by their nature, have thresholds and cut-off points, the new affordable child care scheme is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income thresholds, subsidy rates and income taper rates over time and as further Government investment becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800021#U01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478622300,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I welcome the closing remarks on being flexible and on income subsidy adjustment.

I am committed to implementing the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 which entitles eligible young people to a formal aftercare plan prepared by Tusla in collaboration with the young person leaving care.  I am pleased that the Act places an explicit as opposed to an implicit duty, as is currently the case, on Tusla to satisfy itself as to the young person's need for assistance and support as he or she leaves care.  My Department is working closely with Tusla to ensure that the provisions of the Act can be fully implemented as quickly as possible in the coming months.  Currently, there are approximately 1,900 young people in receipt of aftercare services from Tusla.  In the first six months of this year, 315 young adults were discharged from State care on reaching the age of 18.  Approximately 98% of them were eligible for an aftercare service and 91%, or 280 young people, availed of it.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to funding, the Deputy will be aware that I secured an additional &euro;37 million for Tusla in budget 2017, bringing its total allocation to &euro;713 million.  Tusla will shortly prepare a business plan for my consideration, in which it will set out how it proposes to allocate its total funding for the year, including its spending plans for implementing the legislation on aftercare and in respect of all the other services it provides.  It is important to note that these costs arising relate only to implementation of the provisions of the aftercare legislation.  Young people leaving care typically receive supports relating to accommodation, further education, employment and training, which are funded by other Departments.  This means that the part of Tusla's budget for 2017, which is ultimately allocated to aftercare services under the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, will represent just a small proportion of the total spend by the State on those in receipt of aftercare services.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe that our young people leaving care deserve high quality supports throughout the system and that full implementation of the Child Care (Amendment) Act will be a key element of how our society helps them to make this critical transition in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800023#W00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1478622900,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I welcome that a business plan is being put in place by Tusla.

This work is ongoing.  Options to expand our existing emergency and humanitarian supports for these young people who have no family or relatives form part of this review.  While I have not had many discussions with Tusla, I have held discussions with the Immigrant Council of Ireland and Cabinet colleagues to review this country's response to the overall migrant crisis, including recent events in Calais.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that we already provide significant assistance to unaccompanied minors who arrive in Ireland on an unplanned basis.  In the past five years, Tusla has taken an annual average of 100 referrals of unaccompanied children seeking asylum, with approximately 70 of these being received into care annually.  Thus far this year, 104 unaccompanied children have been referred to Tusla services, of whom 58 remain in care.  Tusla has a dedicated social work team for separated children seeking asylum, which provides support, assessment and care to children arriving alone in Ireland.  Approximately 30% of children referred are reunited with family members or are found to be over 18 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Irish refugee protection programme, Tusla has made an initial commitment to relocating 20 unaccompanied minors from camps in Greece in 2016-17.

The single affordable child care scheme will be open to children from the age of six months up to age three on a universal basis, with targeted support for those most in need at that age range, and for older children.

The study also found that family financial difficulties, such as debt problems and difficulty making ends meet, were associated with poorer outcomes for children.  This accords with international evidence.  Findings such as this strengthen my commitment to working with the Department of Social Protection and other partners to reduce child poverty and deprivation.  In relation to the impact of care, overall the study suggests that five year olds cared for in centre-based care, or indeed other forms of non-parental care at age three, are as emotionally and socially healthy as children in parental care.  The study also finds that a range of other factors relating to child and family characteristics are of far greater importance for five year olds' emotional and social well-being.

The authority has informed the inspectorate that the review should take account of the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas, the views of local communities, the allocation and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment as well as relevant recommendations made in previous inspectorate reports.  The T&aacute;naiste looks forward to receiving the review from the authority and I am informed that it should be available within 12 months.<\/p><p>  Separately, the programme also commits the Government to launching a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings could have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  Accordingly, the T&aacute;naiste has requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify six stations for reopening.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s overarching commitment is to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.

It was the worst decision on the policing of the south east at that time and to date.  Two districts, Enniscorthy and Gorey, were merged into a single Garda district which has a population base of 85,000.  It is bigger than seven or eight counties in the country.  In that one district there is only one superintendent and two inspectors.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to put the negative impact of the decision on the area into context.  I was informed that three new inspectors would be appointed for the three Garda districts in County Wexford, namely Wexford, New Ross and Enniscorthy.  The latter comprises the two aforementioned merged districts.  I did not jump for joy at this news because the population of the Enniscorthy district is equivalent to the population of the two other districts.  The other two districts got one inspector each but Enniscorthy only got one new inspector, even though it has a population of 85,000.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat that it was a terrible, if not ludicrous, decision.  At one stage, there was talk of removing the civilian staff, the sergeants and the inspector from the district but thankfully that did not happen.  The staff remained and Enniscorthy district now has four civilian staff, sergeants and an inspector.  I want the Gorey district to be reinstated as a full policing district.  It is one of the fastest growing districts in the country.  To do what was done by the Assistant Garda Commissioner, Jack Nolan and the then Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, was reckless.

The worry centred on the working conditions associated with the ambulance facility which was housed at that time on the grounds of Ofalia House, a HSE community care facility for the elderly and the sick in Edenderry.  Despite the fears and worries the interested parties worked to the best of their ability over time but earlier this year HIQA announced that the facility could no longer be used for that purpose.  The ambulance service was forced to relocate to Tullamore on the understanding that the relevant works would be carried out at the Ofalia House facility and the service would return to Edenderry within three months.  <\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, on foot of concerns raised by me, many other public representatives and the public, the HSE located a site which is close to the fire station in Edenderry and planning permission for a new ambulance facility was granted earlier this year.  After the relocation to Tullamore, there was a fear on the part of staff and people living in the locality that if temporary accommodation was made available within three months, the commitment to provide a new, purpose-built facility might not be honoured.  All of the public representatives in the area took up the case, including the Deputy opposite, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, I am glad to say.  We sought assurances from the National Ambulance Service and the HSE that the new facility would be forthcoming in order to be able to reassure the public and the staff.  We have received various items of correspondence, including from the assistant chief ambulance officer of the HSE to myself in response to a Parliamentary Question submitted at the end of October and from Mr. Martin Dunne, the director of the National Ambulance Service, to myself, local Deputies and councillors.  A meeting was held with local public representatives six weeks ago, at which more detailed information was provided.  At that meeting, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, who is a Minister of State in the Department of Health, confirmed what was contained in the briefing documentation.<\/p><p>The confirmation was that not only would temporary accommodation be forthcoming in the near future because a site had been identified, as was detailed through some of the correspondence that was made available to us, but more importantly, a firm commitment was given that action would be taken on foot of the granting of planning permission for a new purpose-built facility.  I am taking the opportunity to raise this issue by means of a Topical Issue so that the public can be assured once and for all that given the commitments of the HSE and the National Ambulance Service and the fact planning permission has been forthcoming and a site for temporary accommodation has been identified, that this will be forthcoming and made available and that we can get a commitment that the new facility will start construction in the very near future.  If a date was forthcoming, it would allay everybody's fears and allow people to get on with their work.  In respect of the locality and community of north Offaly, west Kildare, south-east Westmeath and part of Meath and its close proximity to the N4, it is of pivotal importance in respect of responses to emergencies as they arise.  I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility in the Department of Health is here so she can assure the House and, by extension, those we represent that this will be resolved forthwith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800031#EE00500","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478628300,"counter":364,"content":"<p>As somebody who is as anxious as Deputy Cowen in respect of the retention of the ambulance service in Edenderry, I thank him for raising this important matter.  It is a good opportunity to brief the House on this matter.  Since 2006, the National Ambulance Service, NAS, has operated a service from Ofalia House, a HSE care facility in the Edenderry area.  This service was most welcome when it was established ten years ago.  However, the HIQA review pointed to the need for some internal reconfiguration works in Ofalia House to ensure compliance with best practice.  A fund of around &euro;2 million was provided by the previous Government to carry out those refurbishment works.  Works commenced in April 2016 but because of health and safety requirements, the NAS had no option but to vacate the premises.  As one who visited it and saw where the service was trying to operate out of when there was a building site around it, I could understand the decision to put the safety and health of the people who work in the ambulance service to the forefront.<\/p>  <p>  While the original intention had been for the NAS to return to Ofalia House on completion of the building works, as we now know, a major part of the facility previously used by the NAS is no longer available due to the requirement for hospice beds within Ofalia House.  It, therefore, became necessary to relocate the ambulance service to Tullamore.  I acknowledge the excellent service provided by the people based in Edenderry and the fact they co-operated and were so willing to understand what was going on and, at the same time, were anxious to get back to base.  As the Deputy is aware, it is proposed to build a new ambulance station in Edenderry.  A site has been identified and planning approval has been received.  I understand that pending the development of the new station, the NAS, in conjunction with HSE Estates, is actively seeking temporary accommodation for the service in the Edenderry area so that it can resume from Edenderry as soon as possible while clarifying that it is still providing a service while it is based in Tullamore.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we are all aware that the NAS has undergone a very significant process of modernisation in recent years and a number of important service innovations and developments have taken place.  The national emergency operations centre has been established while improved technology has been provided to improve response times.  We have developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, which frees up emergency ambulances for the more urgent calls.  The establishment of a permanent emergency aeromedical support service to provide a more timely response to persons in rural areas has also been a welcome development.  All of us, including Deputy Cowen, know people who have had their lives saved because of that aeromedical support service.<\/p>  <p>  We are also looking at alternatives to the current model of care, which requires every patient to be brought to an emergency department.  The options under consideration include \"hear and treat\" where clinical advice is provided over the phone to callers who can then, if appropriate, be referred to other care pathways.  We have evidence that people's lives have been saved by using the \"hear and treat\" methodology.  I am advised that a recruitment process is under way for the necessary staff to facilitate the roll out of a pilot \"hear and treat\" model of care.<\/p>  <p>  This ambulance reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services, which was published in late 2014, and the NAS capacity review, which was published earlier this year.  The capacity review examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  In that regard, the Deputy can be assured that increased funding will be available to the NAS for 2017.  The detail of the improvements to be funded will be provided in the HSE's 2017 national service plan.  My officials are working closely with their counterparts in the HSE and the NAS to agree priorities in relation to the 2017 allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800032#FF00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1478628300,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

The number of referrals increased from 14,407 in 2014 to 17,000 in 2015.  Waiting lists for access to a first appointment are long and growing.  A total of 2,496 people were waiting for counselling at the end of the first quarter of 2016.  Of these, 45%, or 1,119 people, were waiting for between four and 12 weeks; 21%, or 520 people, were waiting for between 12 and 24 weeks; and 5%, or 139 people, were waiting over 24 weeks.  In the improving access to psychological therapies, IAPT, service in the United Kingdom, the target is that 75% of referrals be seen within just six weeks and 95% within 18 weeks.  These waiting times for those in need of emotional and mental support at very difficult and troubled times in their lives are not acceptable.  A long wait for counselling is not just a possibility; it is the norm.  Over 26% of people waited at least a quarter of a year for their first appointment.  Who knows what people in a vulnerable state may go through in this time?  How many on the lists engaged in self-harm or self-harming behaviour, made an attempt on their life, or sought emergency support which, of course, was found wanting.<\/p>  <p>  Even when people gain access to the CIPC model, they are only offered eight sessions.  That may well be enough for some, but it is also far too little for many.  Mental Health Reform which has been to the fore in raising this issue has called for an expansion of the number to 20 sessions, as in the United Kingdom.  The Minister of State must also work to expand the CIPC service to be available not just to medical card holders but also to people on low incomes who are above the medical card threshold.  Far too many people on low incomes forgo needed counselling because they cannot afford it.  This in the end has untold costs.<\/p>  <p>  The CIPC service is only available to adults.  This is a major gap, given the clear potential for positive outcomes from counselling for younger people who are particularly at risk and poorly placed to afford such counselling.  Jigsaw and other programmes do good work, but they could and should be supplemented when needed, particularly when we know that child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, remain understaffed in most cases based on a recent HSE report.<\/p>  <p>  A major concern for people who wish to see an improvement in this and other mental health services is the failure by the Government to live up to previous pronouncements on budget increases for these services.  The Government has now promised to increase the mental health budget by just 1.8% or &euro;15 million in 2017 - less than half what it claimed on budget day.  Will the Minister of State commit to reviewing this funding level which is clearly inadequate to address growing demand and the need to improve services generally to implement A Vision for Change?  This &euro;15 million is simply not enough and feels like a box-ticking exercise by a Government that, having promised an increase, felt obliged to provide the crumbs off the table but dressed them up as something better when the media were watching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800033#GG00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1478628900,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.

It should not commence when a mental illness becomes too difficult; we need to protect people's mental health in the very early stages.<\/p>  <p>  A commitment was given to improve access to psychological therapy and early counselling therapies.  Following on a commitment in the 2011 programme for Government, the HSE counselling in primary care, CIPC, service was established and formally launched in July 2013.  The primary task of the CIPC service is to provide accessible short-term counselling for adults on low incomes who hold a medical card and present with mild-moderate psychological difficulties in a primary care context.<\/p>  <p>  The service is overseen and managed within the framework of the HSE national counselling service, NCS, and provided in each community health organisation, CHO.  Each director of counselling within the NCS is responsible for the overall clinical governance framework for the CIPC service in their area.  It is co-ordinated on a day-to-day basis in each area by one or more counselling co-ordinators.  There are ten counselling co-ordinators in the CIPC service which sources suitably qualified counsellors on a sessional basis to provide for the needs of individuals using these services.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned some of the figures.  It is important to go through them because obviously the figures have increased.  There has been a growing demand for the CIPC service and consistent growth in the level of service provision.  The referral rate increased from 14,407 referrals nationally in its first year to 17,000 in 2015, an 18% increase.  In the first quarter of 2016 alone there were in excess of 4,500 referrals nationally to the CIPC service.<\/p>  <p>  Since its launch the CIPC service has offered in excess of 128,000 counselling sessions, with 42,000 offered in 2014 and over 65,000 in 2015, a 50% increase on the figure for 2014.  Some 6,000 counselling sessions are being offered every month by the CIPC service.  If it continues at this level, it will represent a 12% increase on the figure for 2015.  The number of referrals is increasing, as is the number of counselling sessions.<\/p>  <p>  In keeping with its primary task of providing accessible short-term counselling for adults in order to facilitate timely intervention with psychological difficulties, the majority of clients are seen within three months of referral, as evidenced by a breakdown of waiting times at the end of March 2016.  Of the 2,496 clients waiting for counselling nationally at the end of the first quarter of 2016, 718 were seen within the first month.  A total of 1,119 were waiting between one and three months.  I agree that we need to get that figure down to or as close to one month as we can.  We also need to reduce the figure of 520 clients who were waiting between three and six months.  Analysis of the 139 clients waiting over six months indicated that the majority of this group had specific requirements such as limited client availability to attend counselling.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy expressed concern about young people's ability to access the CIPC service.  As part of the programme for Government investment in 2016, &euro;5 million has been allocated to primary care services to provide counselling and psychological supports for children under 18 years.  Additional initiatives to enhance early intervention and prevention services include embedding the existing Jigsaw services and the planned addition of five more youth mental health services - two in Cork, two in Dublin and one in Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800033#GG00400","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1478628900,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

The Government had promised to spend approximately &euro;30 million on mental health services and now we are talking about &euro;15 million.

I cannot overemphasise that not enough money has been invested in mental health services and people will suffer as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800033#GG00500","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1478628900,"counter":372,"content":"<p>We need to look at the funding increase in the mental health section within the Department of Health.

There has been a focus on mental health and increasing the funding available for mental health services.  In previous years we found that when funding was allocated, it was not spent.

It is an important issue for the people living in the west who are on the front line of this importation battle between the smugglers and Irish officials.  It is very important for the Garda and Revenue officials in the north west.  They have expressed to me their deep concerns with regard to the lack of drug surveillance operations at our ports and airports.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will be aware that we got very lucky last month when a consignment of cocaine worth some &euro;5 million washed ashore on a beach in County Clare.  This consignment had become detached from a boat at sea and eventually washed ashore in Ireland.  We do not know where the drugs were destined for and we do not know where they came from.  All we know is that 75 kilos of cocaine washed ashore for the public to discover and that our customs officials with dedicated customs cutter boats were not aware of this consignment before it became detached.  This particular incident has raised once more my deep concerns which I have raised with the Department of Finance and with Revenue on several occasions around the west coast of Ireland being used as a drug importation channel by drug cartels.  Revenue and the Government are not on top of this worrying situation and I firmly believe that illegal and dangerous drugs are coming into Ireland illegally via the west coast.  In a reply to the Taoiseach in October 2013, Liam Irwin said Revenue attaches the highest priority to combatting the smuggling of controlled drugs and that it is committed to playing an active role in working against this criminal activity and those responsible for it.  While I accept that this sentiment is the true intent of Revenue in this regard and that lack of resources is the reason why Revenue may not be on top of the situation, I wish to highlight some major issues why we are not reaching the aims of this intent in the west.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to sea access in the west, I am advised that the Revenue fleet of operational cutter boats is not sufficient to cover surveillance and interception operations for the entire west coast.  It is clear to see that Revenue simply needs to prioritise more funding in order to purchase more boats and for more customs personnel to increase our operations in this area.  I am further advised that the Killybegs deep water port in County Donegal has no Revenue drug detection personnel in operation.  This is despite the fact that boats of any shape or size can arrive and leave this port at any time of the day.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain why this is the case.  It seems odd that such an important port would have no drugs customs officers based there.  With regard to airports in the west, and Knock Airport in particular, I am advised that there is now no dedicated drug detector dog based at Knock airport or the in the midlands west region since March 2016 when the previous dog died.  Will the Minister of State provide details as to when this dog will be replaced and what is the overall cost involved?<\/p>  <p>  I also want to highlight that there is no permanent Revenue drug detection staff at Ireland West Airport Knock.  This is despite the fact that more than 800,000 passengers will use the airport in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800034#HH00300","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1478629500,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800034#HH00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1478629500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I have further been advised that no data on the private aircraft which enter and leave Knock airport is being kept and that there is no customs checks on these flights.

The Deputy's commitment in this area is long-standing and well known.  The deployment of Revenue staff is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am advised by Revenue that they use a broad range of data, intelligence and analytical technologies to identify and evaluate risk.  Insights and intelligence are increasingly important in directing Revenue&rsquo;s attention to and response to risk including action to confront suspected non-compliance.  Compliance and enforcement resources are deployed within regions and districts on a risk priority basis and are designed to maximise effective outcomes having regard to the risk being targeted.  Revenue has significant numbers of its staff deployed countrywide engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  More than 860 Revenue staff are currently serving in Revenue&rsquo;s Border, midlands and west regions.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue's intervention and control role at points of importation and exportation is carried out by officers engaged on enforcement duties and are responsible for the implementation of customs controls.  Revenue has an enforcement presence, as required by reference to risk, at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations throughout the State.  As previously alluded to, it places particular emphasis on developing an intelligence based focus at both national and regional level, deploying resources to areas of highest risk.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is augmented, as necessary, with additional personnel on a risk assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place focused on illegal activity.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that compliance and smuggling risks are properly evaluated and addressed, and resources appropriately allocated by Revenue.  I am also assured that Revenue keeps the matter of risk assessment and resource allocations under regular review.  I am advised by Revenue that, as part of its risk focused approach to the discharge of its role in relation to illegal drugs importations, harbours and inlets along the coastline are monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis from the point of view of the potential for smuggling.  This work is supplemented by Revenue&rsquo;s customs drugs watch programme, aimed at encouraging members of the public, coastal and local maritime communities etc. to notify Revenue in confidence of suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through a confidential 24-7 drugs watch freephone facility.  This is a highly valued and successful programme, as evidenced recently by the seizure of a large quantity of drugs near Liscannor, County Clare following a report through the drugs watch programme.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn to Revenue&rsquo;s role in protecting society from the importation of illicit drugs.  I know that Revenue is active in targeting and combatting drug smuggling and in playing its role, in conjunction with the other relevant agencies, in combatting this criminal activity.  As a stakeholder in the Government&rsquo;s national drugs strategy, Revenue plays an important role in implementing the supply reduction pillar.  Strategic and operation plans, which are managed on a national basis, are in place to ensure Revenue meets its commitments under the strategy.  This ongoing commitment is bolstered by the deployment of the two Revenue customs cutters, two large-scale X-ray scanners, several mobile scanners and drugs detector dog teams.  Revenue works closely with other agencies in the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service as part of the joint task force on drug interdiction.  Revenue also works closely with the Health Products Regulatory Authority, in acting against the illegal drugs trade.  Revenue also leverages its contacts within international law enforcement agencies to proactively profile drug trafficking networks.  The relevant authorities in the State work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target organised crime groups that are involved in a range of criminal activities, including the illegal drugs trade.  This work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime is being supported and reinforced by the establishment, in the framework of A Fresh Start: The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan, of the joint agency task force, which includes Revenue.<\/p><p>Revenue is also actively involved in international fora, including the EU's Customs Cooperation Working Party, Europol and the World Customs Organization, in working together with other administrations, agencies and services to counter the trafficking of drugs and drugs precursors.<\/p> <p> I am satisfied with the priority afforded by Revenue to tackling tax evasion and illegal activity such as drugs smuggling and with its risk focused approach to the deployment of resources.  I am also satisfied that it is fully focused on leveraging its co-operation with other State and international agencies and organisations to identify and tackle risk.<\/p> <p> The Minister supported the provision of additional resources to Revenue at its request in budgets 2015 to 2017, inclusive.  This has facilitated the allocation of staff to tackling non-compliance in all its guises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800034#HH00700","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478630100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but I reiterate that I firmly believe customs officials in the Border and midlands region should have the relevant tools and resources to tackle drug smuggling.

We need customs drugs officials based in Kellybegs and Ireland West Airport Knock as a matter of urgency and they need the equipment to be able to conduct their work sufficiently.  We also need a new drugs dog at Ireland West Airport Knock and additional customs cutter boats operating along the west coast.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State believes the State is doing enough to protect our coastline and airports from the illegal importation of drugs and other contraband with the system that is in place?

It also contains a number of largely technical measures which aim to resolve minor deficiencies identified within the welfare code.  Overall, the Bill represents a prudent approach, with modest increases across the board alongside more targeted measures; an inclusive approach, which ensures that the recovery benefits everyone, with no one left behind; a progressive approach to making work pay, through positive reforms to the social insurance system and access to benefits extended to the self-employed; and a targeted approach with measures to assist lone parents, low income farm families and school children.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the maximum rate of all weekly benefits will increase by &euro;5 so that people of working age, as well as retired people aged 66 or older, will all see an improvement in their weekly income.  Increases for recipients aged 66 years and over will come into effect during the week ending 10 March 2017.  This includes, for instance, all those in receipt of the contributory State pension and the non-contributory State pension.  Pensions next year will be &euro;8 per week higher than in 2009, which means nearly all pensioners are back to where they were in terms of payments from the Department, even if we factor in the abolition of the telephone allowance and reductions in the fuel allowance.  I intend to build on this in future budgets by continuing to increase the State pension at a rate greater than the rate of inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The increases for other recipients will come into effect during the week following 10 March, so that all of those who rely on social welfare for their income will have the increased rate paid by St. Patrick's Day.  Approximately 840,000 working age people will gain from this increase.  It covers people in receipt of 30 different payments, including invalidity pension, disability allowance, blind pension, illness and partial capacity benefit, occupational injury benefit, widow's, widowers and surviving civil partner's pensions, one-parent family payment, back to education allowance, maternity, paternity and adoptive benefit, farm assist, carer's benefit and allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, back to work enterprise allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment and employment support payments to participants on community employment, T&uacute;s, Gateway and the rural social scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It was very important to me and to all of my colleagues in government that nobody was left behind as we sought to extend the benefits of the economic recovery to all sectors of society.  Recipients of working age payments, widows, carers, the sick and the disabled have seen no increase in their income since the cuts of 2010 and 2011.  Even after the &euro;5 increase they will still be &euro;11.50 per week worse off than 2011 when the Government came into office, so I plan to continue to increase these rates above the rate of inflation in future budgets if resources permit.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, almost 1.5 million people will benefit from these increases and local communities and businesses will also benefit in turn from increased spending.  A social impact assessment, using the ESRI SWITCH model on a non-indexed basis, of the social welfare budget package found that people in lowest income quintile, the 20% of people least well off in society, gain the most from budget 2017 measures.  The ESRI also recognises explicitly that this was as a result of the inclusion of the weekly rate increase for working age rates of payment.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the increases in weekly rates, the Bill also provides for very progressive changes affecting the self-employed, a sector which is critical to sustaining the Irish economy.  Sections 4 and 9 establish the legislative basis for a new deal for up to 380,000 self-employed people who pay PRSI at the S class.  The self-employed sector is hugely diverse and includes people such as farmers, professionals, taxi drivers, small business owners and tradesmen and tradeswomen.  Until now, the PRSI contributions they pay have enabled them to qualify for a contributory State pension on reaching pension age.  This contributory pension is of course, in itself, a substantial benefit, but I have been concerned for a long time that the social insurance system does not respond adequately to the risks which the self-employed face in the course of their working lives.  I am pleased therefore that budget 2017 marks a major step in resolving this deficiency.  Section 9 provides that from March 2017, the self-employed will be allowed access the optical, dental and hearing benefits currently available to employees under the treatment benefit scheme.  This section also provides that when the range of optical and dental treatments is expanded from October of next year, both employees and the self-employed will benefit equally.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 provides that the self-employed will be entitled to apply for invalidity pension for the first time with effect from December 2017.  This will mean that where a self-employed person is no longer able to continue to work because of long-term ill-health, he or she will have access to the safety net of State income support without a means test.  The person's savings, assets or partner's income will not count against him or her.  This is all part of the Government's policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship.  I intend to extend the benefits available to the self-employed through the social protection system and will look at further options in the coming year.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 included a package of measures supporting lone parents, encouraging them into the workplace and into education, and helping to reduce their child care costs.  All lone parents on one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transition and jobseeker's allowance will receive the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment.  Those who enter education will receive a &euro;500 annual cost of education allowance, which will be made available to back to education allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  This will apply to cohabiting and married couples.  It will be for anyone in receipt of the back to education allowance who has children.  This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to education.<\/p><p>The income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transition payment will rise by &euro;20 from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week reversing, in part, previous reductions to encourage one-parent families to stay in work, return to work and work more hours.  For those earning &euro;110 per week or more, it will increase the combined take-home income by up to &euro;15 per week and my intention is to allow for this from 1 January, subject to the passage of the Bill.<\/p> <p> The single affordable child care scheme being provided by the Government will also significantly reduce the cost of child care for lone parents and low-income families.  It is a step change in State support for child care in Ireland.  I have also provided increased funding for school breakfasts, which will help lone parents and low-income households more generally.  Some 63% of one-parent family payment recipients do not receive any income from paid work.  The changes in budget 2017 and the Bill will assist lone parents into education and to keep more of what they earn where they are back in employment.  They will help them to escape the trap of long-term welfare dependency.<\/p> <p> As part of the Government's commitment to rural Ireland, I plan to completely reverse cuts to farm assist, a programme which helps more than 8,000 low-income farm families and fisherfolk.  At a time of falling farm incomes, it is essential that we strengthen the safety net for farmers who are on the margins.  Even farmers who do not qualify for farm assist should have the reassurance of a strong safety net should they need it.  Many farmers who benefit from farm assist live in remote parts of the country with very limited prospects of an off-farm income.  Therefore, in recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the rural social scheme, an additional 500 places will be made available next year.<\/p> <p> Young jobseekers under the age of 26 years generally receive age-related reduced rates of jobseeker's payments of &euro;100 or &euro;144 per week.  These will increase proportionally with the general rate increases.  However, the focus of the Government is on helping and encouraging young jobseekers into employment and education.  We do this by actively engaging with and helping them to receuve additional training and educational qualifications that will assist them to find a job.  I strongly believe welfare should be a second chance or a safety net, not a way of life.  Therefore, from next September, when a young jobseeker participates in my Department's back to education schemes, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker's payment which will then be &euro;193 per week, as opposed to the &euro;160 which they currently receive.  This 21% increase represents an extra &euro;33 a week and demonstrates the State's support for young jobseekers who seek to enhance their lives.  It is the biggest single increase in the social welfare package.  Of course, more remains to be done and I am determined that we will help more young people in the most effective way possible by helping them into the workforce or education.<\/p> <p> I will now give a brief outline of the various sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the definition of certain common terms used in the Bill.  <\/p> <p> Section 2 provides for one of the technical amendments to the social welfare code which are being carried in the Bill.  In this instance, the definition of a qualified adult in the Act is being amended so as to formally provide that a person in respect of whom an increase for a qualified adult is being paid is not disqualified from receipt of a half-rate carer's allowance in his or her own right.  To be absolutely clear, the scheme has been operating since its inception in line with the policy intention that a person can qualify for a half-rate carer's allowance in his or her own right when she or he is a qualified adult on another person's claim.  No one has lost out in the interim and this amendment merely serves to tidy up the governing legislation in this area, lest there be a challenge.<\/p> <p> Sections 3 and 4 provide for the addition of paternity benefit and invalidity pension to the list of schemes for which class S contributions, payable by self-employed persons, are reckonable.  Paternity benefit has been open to the self-employed since the scheme was introduced in September, while invalidity pension will be open to the self-employed from December next year.  <\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for a technical amendment to the legislation governing entitlement to illness benefit which secures the existing practice and policy intention whereby the rate of payment to a claimant is held constant for a period of 312 benefit days or one year.  In practical terms, this ensures a claimant is not negatively affected where his or her claim for illness benefit straddles two years and the governing contribution year changes as a result.  This section also confirms the existing practice whereby a claimant on a reduced rate illness benefit payment can gain as a result of a change in the governing contribution year when my Department will ensure the higher rate is paid.<\/p> <p> Sections 6 to 8, inclusive, provide for the increase of &euro;5 in the weekly rates of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit which will come into effect in March 2017.  The main changes in the rates are dealt with in sections 18 and 22 to which I will come shortly.  <\/p> <p> Section 9(a) is similar to sections 3 and 4 and provides for the extension of treatment benefit to the self-employed.  This section will come into effect in March 2017.  The purpose of section 9(b) is to widen the application of the treatment benefit scheme beyond what is currently provided for, which is limited to dental and optical examinations.  Once the necessary discussions with the bodies representing dentists and opticians are finalised, I will introduce regulations to make an expanded treatment benefit scheme available to both the employed and self-employed with effect from October 2017.  I am a strong supporter of the contributory principle, the idea that people who pay into the system should benefit from it.  We should not divide society into one group that pays for everything but receives little in return and another that contributes very little but believes itself to be entitled to everything for free.  Social insurance is the contributory principle at its best and I envisage more benefits being linked with it in the future.<\/p> <p> Section 10 is another provision which brings policy and practice into line with the legislation.  Put simply, it allows lone parents in receipt of both the one-parent family payment and blind pension to retain both until their youngest child turns 16 years.  This has been done on an administrative basis to date, pending the tidying up of this aspect of the social welfare legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for an amendment to the definition of qualified child for the purposes of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to provide that the qualified child must be ordinarily resident in the State.  This will formally bring the definition of a qualified child for the purposes of the scheme into line with that used in the wide range of other schemes operated by the Department.<\/p> <p> Section 12 is an amendment to require employers, where they are requested to do so, to provide information for the Department on child benefit claims.  This mirrors the existing requirements in a number of other schemes operated by the Department such as family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.  These powers are particularly relevant in the case of child benefit payments made on the basis of employment in the State under EU regulations.  In order to determine entitlement at the initial claim stage and ensure the right to ongoing entitlement can be validated, the Department must be able to secure confirmation of details from employers.<\/p> <p> Section 13 deals with situations where a person has an entitlement to maternity, paternity, health and safety or adoptive benefit, as well as the back to work family dividend.  Since January 2015, the back to work family dividend offers financial support to families moving from social welfare into employment where the claimant, having taken up employment or self-employment, stops claiming a jobseeker's payment or a one-parent family payment.  It has been brought to our attention that, under the legislation, someone in receipt of the family dividend cannot concurrently receive payment for maternity, paternity, health and safety or adoptive benefit.  Where that happens, payment of the family dividend is suspended until entitlement to, for example, maternity benefit is exhausted, at which point payment of the family dividend is resumed.  This practice is disruptive for affected individuals, as well as being very cumbersome from an administrative perspective.  Section 13 provides that maternity, paternity, health and safety or adoptive benefit may be paid concurrently with the back to work family dividend.<\/p> <p> Section 14 provides powers to allow regulations to be introduced to prescribe a specified time for making a paternity benefit claim.  Again, this measure is a standard provision which applies to the full range of welfare schemes.  <\/p> <p> The purpose of section 15 is to ensure there are adequate legislative powers to enable the Minister for Social Protection to set out in regulations the conditions which apply where a person nominates another to act as his or her temporary agent to receive or collect a social welfare payment on his or her behalf.<\/p> <p> Section 16 is another technical amendment.  It simply provides that the current references in the social welfare consolidation Act to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being seconded to the Department by the Minister to exercise the powers and duties of a social welfare inspector will now, more accurately, provide that the garda&iacute; in question are seconded to the Minister.<\/p> <p> Section 17 deals with the position of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals and their families who were working in Ireland during the transitional period from 2007 to 2011.  The section provides that contracts of service in the State in which they engaged during that transitional period fall within the categories of employment where a person is regarded as an employed contributor.  As a result, PRSI contributions paid by Romanian or Bulgarian employed contributors during the transitional period will be recognised as valid.<\/p><p> Section 18, along with Schedule 1, provides for new rates for social insurance benefits.  The increase of &euro;5 in the maximum weekly rate of the State pension, contributory, will be paid from 10 March next year, as will the increase in the widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension where the claimant is aged 66 or over.  The increases in all the other insurance-based payments will come into effect in the week ending 17 March in line with the payments calendar.  Proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced rate payments and for qualified adult dependants are also provided. <\/p> <p> Section 19 provides for the inclusion of a reference to the green low-carbon agri-environmental scheme, GLAS, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the relevant Schedule to the Act in order to formally provide that income from this scheme should be partially disregarded in assessing means for social assistance payments.  Section 20 provides for the reintroduction of the income disregards and tapering arrangements which applied to the farm assist scheme prior to budget 2012.<\/p> <p> Section 21 provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for the one-parent family payment, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing previous reductions and offering a greater encouragement to one-parent families to stay in work, return to work or work longer hours.  As I mentioned earlier, taken together with the increase in the weekly rate of one-parent family payment this will, in many cases, increase take-home pay by &euro;15 per week.  Subject to the passage of this Bill by this House and the Seanad prior to the Christmas recess, this measure will come into effect from 5 January 2017. <\/p> <p> Section 22, along with Schedule 2, provides for new rates of social assistance payments.  All maximum weekly allowances are being increased by &euro;5, with proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced rate payments.  Proportionate increases for qualified adult dependants are also provided.  As with the insurance-based schemes covered by section 18, the increases for those aged 66 and over will be paid in the week ending 10 March 2017, with all other increases coming into effect over the course of the following week.  Section 23 sets out the standard provisions in relation to the Short Title, construction and commencement of the Bill, once enacted. <\/p> <p> The measures contained in this Bill will be supplemented by other budget measures which do not require amendments to the primary legislation.  For example, the payment of the Christmas bonus early next month, which will benefit more than 1.2 million people at a cost of some &euro;221 million, is one such measure.  The Bill reflects the prudent approach of the Government to ensuring that the economic recovery, which is under way and which is reflected in increasing numbers of people securing employment, is not put at risk.  There are meaningful, if modest, increases in social welfare payments which will benefit individuals, families and their communities.  There are also specific targeted measures which will provide additional supports to vulnerable sectors of our society, including one-parent families and low-income farm families and fishermen. <\/p> <p> The Bill is also reforming in recognising the unique contribution which the self- employed make to our economy and society.  It strengthens the connection between PRSI contributions and benefits through, for example, the enhanced treatment benefits in respect of dental, optical and hearing care for the employed and self-employed and access to invalidity pension for the self-employed.  I should mention at this point that I intend to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment which will change the social insurance status of city and county councillors as public officeholders so that, in general, their income as councillors will in future be liable for class S PRSI.  In return for their PRSI contribution of 4% they will be able to access the same benefits as a self-employed person paying the same amount.  This will end the injustice of councillors paying PRSI but receiving nothing in return for these contributions, unlike the employed and self-employed, who pay the same percentage.<\/p> <p> I also wish to advise the House that I will bringing forward another amendment on Committee Stage to update the provisions in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which relate to habitual residence.  My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality expects to be in a position to formally commence certain provisions of the International Protection Act 2015 before the end of this year.  The Act deals with the entry into and presence in the State of people in need of international protection and as a consequence the relevant sections of the Social Welfare Act will need to be updated and aligned with this legislation.  <\/p> <p> This is the first Social Welfare Bill to be introduced under this Government.  I hope it is one of many that will improve living standards, assist people to move from welfare into work, support self-employment, promote self-reliance and develop a strong social insurance system based on the contributory principle.  <\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800035#JJ00900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478631300,"counter":391,"content":"<p>This Bill seeks to implement the social welfare changes announced in the budget.  Contrary to speculation, Fianna F&aacute;il did not draw up budget 2017 but it did influence it.  As a result of the influence we exercised in the budget we are beginning to see an element of fairness being restored to the social welfare system after five years of harsh, punitive and regressive budgets.  This budget, for the first time in many years, is not weighted in favour of those least in need.  Fianna F&aacute;il can take a certain amount of credit for that.<\/p>  <p>  I was never a fully paid up member of the school of economics such that when one has money one should spend it.  However, that is precisely what we did in the past in terms of social welfare and I make no apologies for our having done so.  In 1997 and 2007 under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, basic social welfare rates increased by 123%, which is three times the 41% increase in the Consumer Price Index and double the 61% increase in gross average industrial earnings.  It is true to say that in the teeth of the financial crisis, in 2010, we were forced to cut social welfare.  That was a very painful decision, politically, and one which cost Fianna F&aacute;il dearly.  However, we did not cut pensions or ancillary benefits and so the cut was the minimum possible that we could impose in the particular circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the increases that we provided when times were better it is true that we did not make anybody in receipt of social welfare rich.  Nobody who is reliant on social welfare to survive from week to week can be described as being well-off.  What we did was lift a lot of people out of poverty, although only barely.  That is the reality.  Bad or inadequate as social welfare provisions here may be, they compare very favourably with those in our neighbouring jurisdiction across the Border.  For example, in this country jobseeker's allowance for people under 25 years of age is &euro;100 per week, soon to increase to &euro;102.70 compared with &euro;65 in Northern Ireland.  For people here aged over 25 years it is &euro;188, soon to increase to &euro;193, whereas in Northern Ireland it is the princely sum of &euro;82.23.  Similarly with job seeker's benefit.  Disability allowance here is &euro;188 per week compared with &euro;93 per week in Northern Ireland.  Carer's allowance here is &euro;204 per week for people under 66 years of age and for people over 66 years of age and caring for one person it is &euro;242, compared with &euro;69 in Northern Ireland.

It was usual in good times and bad for budgetary increases to kick in from 1 January the following year.  I would like to see that system restored.  However, I make no apologies for campaigning for an increase for pensioners.  If one looks at what has happened for them in the past five years, one can see the withdrawal of the free telephone rental allowance, the decimation of the household benefits package, restrictions in qualification for a medical card and the introduction of water charges and the property tax.  All of these are matters which bear down heavily on those with fixed incomes.  It was time pensioners got a break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800037#LL01000","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478631900,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il started it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800038#MM00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1478631900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I am very glad that we helped to persuade the Government to give them that break.  <\/p><p>I also welcome the increases for those of working age.  However, nothing has yet been done about the averaging system for pensions.  This was a particular measure introduced by the previous Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and it has given rise to a situation where a person who enters the social welfare system just before his or her 56th birthday and pays stamp for ten years will be entitled to a full pension.  If somebody pays stamp equal to 20 years contributions over a longer period, in many cases, he or she will be entitled to less.  A system which provides that one receives a higher pension in making fewer contributions is patently unfair.  I know that this is a particularly difficult problem to unscramble.  However, we have all had people in our constituency offices who paid stamp back in the 1950s or 1960s before leaving the workforce, generally because they got married.  They later re-entered the workforce.  Surely, it is not beyond the wit of the entire intelligentsia in the Department of Social Protection to find some way to mitigate the impact.  The homemaker's scheme which Fianna F&aacute;il introduced in 1994 was an attempt to do this to some extent, but there are many hard cases.  Many people come to me to point to their situation which is impossible to justify.<\/p><p>Above and beyond this, we must tackle the question of pensions generally.  The demographics show that after 1980 the birthrate dropped substantially and it only began to recover in the early 2000s.  However, it never recovered to its 1980 peak.  That is one side of the equation.  The other is the fact that we are all living longer, which is something to be applauded.  We should not look at pensioners and the elderly as bed-blockers and a demographic time bomb.  They are the ones who worked hard to build the country.  Unfortunately, however, the numbers are such that the social welfare system will become unsustainable in a relatively short space of time.  The statistic is that there are five workers for every pensioner, but that is due to change gradually in the next 30 years to a ratio of 2:1.  That is a relatively short space of time and more and more pressure will be placed on the system in the interim.  That has been evident for some time and it is incumbent on us as a society to look for solutions.  There has been a great deal of talk about solutions, but little or no action has resulted from it.<\/p><p>Traditionally, one of the things successive Governments did to encourage people to provide for themselves was to give them tax relief.  Studies conducted by the ERSI and others have identified a significant dead-weight loss associated with tax incentives for those in the upper income levels.  In other words, they had the resources to save and would probably have provided for themselves anyway.  As such, the tax relief was a bonus.  That is why the last Government and its predecessor began the process of reducing this pension-related tax incentive.  I cannot judge where we are in relation to it, but it is probable that we have reached the point of diminishing returns.  The Minister may be aware of the very important document produced by Social Justice Ireland which recommends a universal pension scheme.  What is proposed is that the revenue gained in abolishing all tax relief on pensions would be sufficient to provide for a universal pension.  I have read the document and it is impressive, well put together and well argued.  Whether the figures stand up, I am not qualified to say.  However, I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.<\/p><p>Defined benefit pension schemes are disappearing rapidly.  We have proposed in the past few years a few simple amendments which would at least help to arrest that trend or mitigate the position for workers when a pension scheme collapses.  However, we did so without success.  In her wisdom, the previous Minister advised the D&aacute;il to vote down the amendments.  I see no reason a healthy pension scheme should not be required to be at least 90% funded before it can be closed down.  There are various other factors in liability calculation.  The liability calculation is absolutely artificial.  It is an accounting fiction.  While a certain amount has been done in that regard in that trustees are now entitled to a greater extent to invest in Irish Government bonds, surely that process should be accelerated.  I think it was Einstein who said the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  There is a touch of that about the pension system.  We have heard plenty of talk and discussion, seen plenty of papers and documents and had plenty of seminars but very little action.  The previous Minister used to regale us with tales from far-flung places such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand where a marvellous system of auto-enrolment had been introduced.  That system was introduced recently in the United Kingdom.  A recent study conducted by Mercer shows that it has worked very well there where 90% of young people have not opted out.  In fact, 80% of people under the age of 35 years have managed to keep paying at the highest possible rate.  It is time to have a very serious look at the pension system here.  It is a problem which is coming down the line and I trust the Minister will turn his attention to it once the Social Welfare Bill is out of the way.<\/p><p>We have all made representations on behalf of single parents.  In fact, the matter was discussed again at the Joint Committee on Social Protection this morning.  The Minister will be aware that Dr. Michelle Millar and Dr. Rosemary Crosse were commissioned by his Department to carry out an independent analysis of how the changes to the lone parent allowance made by the previous Government had played out.  The result is a searing indictment of the new system.  The authors state:<\/p><blockquote>One of the greatest concerns of those interviewed about the policy changes is the reduction in the combined income of those one-parent family payment recipients who were in part-time employment prior to the change.  With the exception of those countries that introduced a time limit on welfare payments, there is no evidence of activation resulting in lone parents in receipt of welfare being financially worse off as a result of policy change.  Policy often has unintended consequences but if the premise of activation policy is to reduce poverty levels by increasing the number of lone parents in paid employment, then a policy which results in lone parents in paid employment being financially worse off has evidently created an unintended consequence and needs revision.  This neither encourages welfare recipients to enter into employment nor will it result in an increase in the income of the household; rather, it has the perverse effect of encouraging welfare dependency and reducing household income.<\/blockquote><p>By any standards, that is a pretty damning indictment from somebody who was commissioned by the Government to conduct an independent report on how the system is working.  Various charts have been produced by people who represent lone parents showing how lone parents who go to work fare.  We are supposed to be encouraging lone parents to go to work, but they will lose money as a result of these changes.<\/p> <p> Right on cue, a number of organisations representing lone parents have released literature advising lone parents, whose working family dividend will run out, that if they are in receipt of child maintenance, they should switch from FIS back to jobseeker's transitional payments.  In other words, they are advising them to switch from work-related to welfare-related payments, which is the precise opposite of the policy intention behind those changes.  They were meant to move people from welfare to work, but they are moving them from work back to welfare.  A number of organisations which have communicated with us, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and SPARK, have pointed out that there are many anomalies in the current system.  For example, a lone parent returning to education may be eligible for the SUSI grant depending on whether he or she is in receipt of rent allowance.  The system is riddled with anomalies like that.  I welcome the change announced by the Minister.  Any improvement is obviously welcome, but I noted in the public expenditure statement accompanying the budget that the change would cost &euro;9 million per annum.  I received a reply from the Minister on 17 August.  I had asked what the cost of changing the age limit to 12 years would be and I was told it would be &euro;9.9 million.  Quite frankly, that would be a much better approach and would not cost the State anything.  I commend the presentation from Dr. Michelle Millar to an Oireachtas committee to the Minister.  She suggested a number of alternative ways of dealing with the matter.  It is a running sore and will not go away.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposal to increase job seeker's allowance from &euro;160 per week to the top rate, which is something I recommended, for people who re-enter the education system.  In this and in other jurisdictions there is a differential between the rate of social welfare paid to people aged under 25 and over 25 years.  We can argue the case in different ways.  I am not persuaded that the differential needs to be extended further, but it will be as a result of the Bill.  Somebody on the full rate of jobseeker's allowance will receive an increase of &euro;5 per week, but somebody on the lower rate, which is applicable to people aged between 18 and 24 years, of &euro;100 per week will only receive an increase of &euro;2.70 per week.  Therefore, the gap continues to widen.<\/p> <p> Somebody in the public domain asked the Minister about this recently, and he said he did not want to send out the wrong signal.  I understand that, but what are we saying?  Are we saying that if we give somebody who is 23 years of age and unemployed &euro;102.70 per week he or she will strive mightily to re-enter the education system or grab a job, whereas if the same person was given &euro;105 per week he or she would sit at home?  I do not think there is any logic to that view.<\/p> <p> I refer to the activation system.  We all know that society is changing, and we are in an era where traditional skills are disappearing and people have to upgrade their education on a regular basis.  It is only right that there should be a system of reskilling and retraining.  Generally speaking, we call that activation.  However, unfortunately in this country, activation is tied to compulsion.  We have a system of retraining and reskilling which is compulsory.  Changes made in the past couple of years have introduced compulsion to a much greater degree than had previously been the case.<\/p> <p> We now have a situation where if somebody is offered a training or an education course, regardless of how irrelevant or inappropriate it may be, he or she must sign up or lose some or all of his or her welfare payments.  Equally, if somebody is offered a job, regardless of how low paid, insecure or inappropriate, he or she must sign up or face social welfare penalties.  We are ramming square pegs into round holes from one end of the country to the other.  I know people who were offered jobs, through JobPath, which they had no interest in or qualifications for and which were located up to 50 km from Limerick city.  The cost of going to work would mean they were at a loss over and above what they received in social welfare payments.<\/p> <p> The social welfare system has become more authoritarian and unsympathetic.  It is forcing many people into low-paying and unskilled jobs which, of course, only benefits employers.  We have to examine the system quite seriously.<\/p> <p> The Minister will recall that the Government instituted a study on JobBridge.  I will not take up the time of the House or embarrass certain people by reading out some of the testimonials I have received from people who had very bad experiences with JobPath and Turas Nua.  A very detailed study into the operations of Turas Nua and the sort of results it has or has not produced, as the case may be, is now overdue.<\/p> <p> I welcome the extension of the social insurance system to invalidity pensioners.  However, I note the committee which considered this, namely, the advisory group on tax and social welfare which reported in 2013, came to the conclusion, for reasons which are quite a mystery to me, that any extension of the social insurance scheme to the self-employed should only be for long-term benefits and should not cover things like occupational injury benefit, illness benefit, etc.  A certain reasoning was given for that conclusion, but to my mind, to put it at its most polite, it is less than persuasive.  In comparison to other European countries, we are way behind on this matter.  The countries which have social insurance schemes for the self-employed cover long-term and short-term illnesses.<\/p> <p> There are a number of ways in which we could introduce such a scheme.  There could be a compulsory increase in employers' PRSI.  We could allow people to voluntarily sign up to the scheme.  Alternatively, we could have recourse to the taxpayer.  The Minister has opted for the latter.  I note he is following the advice of the advisory committee that reported in 2013, which rejected a voluntary system.  Again, in so far as I could understand the language used surrounding the reasons for the refusal, it seemed to be the case that the committee said we had never done this before so we cannot do it now.<\/p> <p> To say the least, that is a peculiar view given that other European countries, including advanced countries and recent entrants to the EU, have voluntary schemes for illness benefit for the self-employed.  These countries include Denmark, Finland, Germany, to some extent, Spain, France, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland and even Lithuania.  We have been told that we cannot have such a scheme because we never had one before.<\/p><p> The Minister has allocated &euro;5 million to the introduction of the invalidity pension for the self-employed from December of next year, which is 14 months away.  There was a social welfare briefing during the week, which I unfortunately could not attend.  A member of my office asked what would be the cost of it in a full year.  The figure given was &euro;25 million or something of that nature.  My understanding from replies I received from the Department previously was that the cost would be &euro;74 million per year.  Perhaps &euro;74 million covers short-term illness benefit as well and that the figure of &euro;25 million just refers to invalidity pension.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p> We have to tackle poverty traps.  There are elements to the social welfare system that disincentivise people from going to work.  For example, the three-day rule provides that a person working 15 hours per week over three days can sign on for social welfare for the remainder of the working week.  If that person is working 15 hours per week over four days, it is not possible.  That is blatantly unfair and does not recognise the realities of the modern workplace.  It should be an hours-based system.  There will be some complexity in moving to such a system, but we will inevitably have to move in that direction.<\/p> <p> There are also disincentives built into the present operation of the family income supplement, FIS, scheme, which needs refinement.  Does the Minister intend to abolish the scheme?  He has spoken about introducing a family dividend.  Will that be a substitute for the FIS scheme or will it be introduced alongside it?  This is a relevant issue.<\/p> <p> Many other possible reforms would not cost the State a penny.  For example, the time has come to abolish mandatory retirement.  We should set up a special unit within Intreo or IDA Ireland that is specifically aimed at those aged more than 50 years.  It is time to give more flexible access to private pension funds.  That has worked well in the UK also.  It will be necessary to have a proper advice scheme to advise people on what to do with their money and how to approach the matter though.<\/p> <p> There will come a time when we will have to have a special cost of living for those with disabilities.  Only 30% of those with disabilities are part of the workforce.  Disability spending has reduced by approximately 10% in the past five years, which was a time of increasing demand.  Everyone knows that it is more expensive for those with disabilities to live from week to week than it is for the average, fully healthy person.<\/p> <p> The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was substantially reduced over the past number of years.  Looking at the figures, it would not cost a great deal to restore it to some extent.  It should be restored at the earliest possible opportunity because it was designed to assist, and only assisted, the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable of the population.<\/p> <p> We can say the same about fuel allowance.  At a time of rampant fuel poverty, there has been a partial restoration of the fuel allowance, which had been reduced, but the partial restoration is not sufficient.<\/p> <p> This morning the lone parents' organisations pointed out to us that non-custodial parents are now receiving correspondence from the Department of Social Protection to the effect that they need no longer contribute to their child's upkeep, which is scandalous.  This legislative lacuna occurred when the concept of jobseekers' transition was created and it is time it was dealt with.<\/p> <p> We need to seriously consider overhauling the social welfare appeals system.  It would not be a matter of reinventing the wheel.  Detailed studies have been undertaken on this issue by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC.  This organisation has pointed out the deficiencies in the system and put forward far-reaching proposals for reform.

Those aged 25 years will receive an increase of &euro;3.80.<\/p><p>Instead of struggling to live on &euro;100 per week, those aged between 18 and 24 years will now struggle on &euro;102.70 simply because of their age.  These increases were hardly surprising coming from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, given that he struggles to comprehend how any young person could be on a jobseeker's payment in the first place.  He made his feelings towards young people crystal clear; the full rate of jobseeker's benefit is far too generous for them.  The Minister has also expressed confusion about young people with poor English and qualifications coming to Ireland from foreign shores and taking up employment in a matter of weeks, while young Irish people seem unable to do likewise.  Apparently, to use his words, \"there are lots of jobs.\"  <\/p> <p> Not content with running thousands of young people out of the country when it purposely cut jobseeker's payments in the first place, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has played its part in ensuring the discrimination against young people it started in 2009 will continue.  While it engages in the pretence of being outraged by the level of the increase and has vowed to reverse it, the crocodile tears Fianna F&aacute;il has shed about a tiny increase in payments for young jobseekers come a little late in the day.  It was part of negotiating the budget and, ultimately, can take responsibility for the measures for young jobseekers.  In contrast to the numerous U-turns it has made since the general election, its message for young people has remained consistent - they should live on &euro;100 a week and be grateful or leave the country.  I assume this is one of the common policy objectives it shares with Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the increase in the back to education allowance for jobseekers aged under 26 years to a new full rate of &euro;193.  However, given that recipients of the allowance do not qualify for the maintenance component of the student grant, the current rate will not sustain a young person through a three or four-year course.  For many young people, returning to college also means having to move to access a college course and incurring additional costs which the back to education allowance will simply not cover.<\/p> <p> While it was not anticipated that the Government would make life more difficult for lone parents, the common policy objectives it shares with Fianna F&aacute;il have made this possible.  The single biggest issue for lone parents, the reduction to seven years in the cut-off age for the one-parent family payment, is not addressed in the Bill.  While it is argued that the Government reforms were implemented as an incentive to encourage lone parents into employment, family income supplement, the in-work support for lone parents, has not been increased.  As a result, many parents on family income supplement would be better off if they transferred to the jobseeker's schemes.<\/p> <p> It has been well documented that the lone parent reforms have had the perverse effect of encouraging welfare dependency and reducing household income.  A recent report undertaken by the UNESCO child and family research centre at NUI Galway echoes this view.  It concludes that the policy has left lone parents in paid employment financially worse off.<\/p> <p> The Government seems to ignore the blatant fact that the capacity of a lone parent to work and care is not equal to that of a two-parent family.  Lone parents are unable to participate in full-time employment when they are a child's sole carer because they are locked out of accessing child care owing to a lack of availability and the substantial costs involved.  The Government's promise to introduce a Scandinavian child care model on the back of the lone parent reforms is nothing but a distant memory.  Difficulties with the cost and availability of child care have been repeatedly acknowledged as an issue of concern for those parenting alone who wish to return to paid employment.  Analysis by the OECD indicates that full-time day care for two preschool children accounts for 40% of the family income of an Irish lone parent on an average income compared with an OECD average of 13%.  A report by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recommended that the State reverse the reforms to the one-parent family payment until such time as an adequate and affordable child care system was in place.  Perhaps ignoring this recommendation is also part of the shared policy objectives of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> According to the Government, lone parents also have the option of returning to education or engaging in training, neither of which can be accessed without proper child care.  The Government needs to get its head around the fact that, in the absence of affordable child care, returning lone parents to work is not a realistic prospect. <\/p> <p> An end to the farce known as JobBridge has been announced on numerous occasions, including as far back as 1 May 2016.  I welcome the reduction in funding for the scheme in budget 2017 as a clear signal that it will be abolished.  However, I am concerned that the Minister for Social Protection has been unable to provide details of a new scheme now that JobBridge has been closed to new applicants.  The issues that gave rise to the serious concerns highlighted in the Department's audit of JobBridge cannot be allowed to continue in the replacement scheme.  In that respect, JobBridge 2.0 will not cut it and a root and branch reform will be required.  As I have outlined previously, Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a credible alternative to JobBridge.  I urge the Minister to examine our alternative proposals as a means of getting young people into the workforce.<\/p> <p> The annual &euro;500 cost of education allowance introduced for parents and lone parents in receipt of the back to education allowance is not new as an earlier payment was abolished in 2013.  Without access to affordable child care and the maintenance element of the student grant, lone parents will find that returning to education is not a sustainable option.<\/p> <p> Child maintenance is another major issue that is impacting on lone parents.  The Department places an onus on lone parents to seek maintenance from former partners.  On the one hand, it issues letters to the parent who is liable to pay maintenance in which it states maintenance payments are no longer obligatory once a child reaches the age of seven years, while, on the other, it tells lone parents they will face financial sanctions if they do not seek maintenance.  This approach places lone parents in an impossible and sometimes dangerous position and must end.  Lone parents do not feature in the considerations of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  That the Minister has not even bothered to respond to the UNESCO child and family centre's report reinforces this view.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael make commitments before elections, only to dump them when elected.  In their election manifestos they pledged to increase the living alone allowance, yet no such increase was provided for in budget 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800040#OO04000","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478633700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>How much is it in the North?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800041#PP00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1478633700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>No interruptions, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800041#PP00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1478633700,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Older people living alone are among the most vulnerable in society.

This is something else both parties have in common.  While Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il both acknowledge fuel poverty - Deputy Willie O'Dea referred to it himself - they failed to turn about any of the cuts imposed on fuel allowance.  The rate remains the same.  Currently, 28% of households across the State experience fuel poverty.  That means we have older people who are cold in their own homes.  We know Ireland has the highest levels of excess winter mortality in Europe with an estimated 2,800 excess deaths every winter, yet Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed to address this in budget 2017.  The reality is older people travel on public transport during the day to keep warm.  They ration fuel at home because they cannot afford it and are having to go to bed early just to stay warm.<\/p>  <p>  During the general election campaign, I met a lady who told me how she goes to her local library to keep warm.  She meets many other elderly people from the community there.  This is happening the length and breadth of the State.  Our elderly have to go into public buildings to keep warm because of the gross inadequacy of the fuel allowance and the fuel poverty 28% of our population experiences.  This is utterly unacceptable.  Budget 2017 has done nothing in that regard.  Due to the inaction of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, this will continue.<\/p>  <p>  There was a song and dance about the &euro;5 increase in the State pension.

While it is acknowledged older people need this increase, the message from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il is they will have to wait for it.  The Bill fails to address all of the significant inconsistencies which exist in our pension system.  We have the most bizarre ongoing situation where 65 year olds are being forced into jobseeker's payment on retirement as a consequence of abolishing the transitional State pension.  The only income available to those who are obliged to retire at 65 is a jobseeker's payment.  The Department is not interested in whether these people are actively seeking employment, the main criteria for receipt of such a payment.  It just wants 65 year olds to take the jobseeker's payment quietly for the year.  Many cases involve a person retiring at 65 who has worked for maybe 40 or 50 years who has diligently paid pension contributions but is now told they cannot access their pension for a year.  As of April of this year, there were more 65 year olds in receipt of jobseeker's payments than any other age category.  That is 5,075 65 year old men and women across the State.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, a lady made contact with my office on this matter.  Her late husband was forced onto the jobseeker benefit on retirement.  He had worked his entire life and, for him, signing on caused him frustration and distress.  The lady told me how the Department instructed her late husband not to leave the country for any lengthy periods or he would lose his payment.  The couple had hoped to visit their children and grandchildren in Australia, a country difficult to visit for a short two-week stay.  The Department, however, dictated what this man could and could not do.  This situation caused huge distress to this man on his retirement.  He did not want to be made feel he was to receive payment for no work on jobseeker's benefit.  On retirement, he was made feel he was supposed to be seeking work while, at the same time, he was restricted when it came to visiting his family abroad.<\/p>  <p>  That is only one case of many.  Forcing 65 year olds into a jobseeker's payment will not sustain the State pension system.  It does not work and it leaves older people at a financial disadvantage receiving &euro;64 less than they would on the State pension.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il saw no need to address this in the Social Welfare Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Women are also bearing the brunt of the changes made to the State's contributory pension scheme by Fine Gael.  When it comes to retirement, the gender pension gap between men and women is 35%.  The number of PRSI contributions needed to receive the State pension remains at 520.  This was significantly increased from 260 in 2012.  The primary reason for the inequality in the pension cuts is that women often have to take time out of work to rear children or were forced out of jobs due to the marriage bar.  Despite inequality for women, however, neither Fine Gael nor Fianna F&aacute;il saw the need to address women's pensions in budget 2017 and, consequentially, in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Those with disabilities will see a &euro;5 increase in their payments but the promise of a new motorised transport grant remains just that - a promise with no action.  Three and a half years after a commitment from the Taoiseach in this Chamber, there remains no replacement grant in place.  Transport costs are cited again and again as expensive and difficult to manage.  Those with disabilities cannot be left to wait another three years for this replacement.<\/p>  <p>  It is not enough to give those with disabilities an extra fiver and leave it at that.  Those with disabilities need to be encouraged and given the same opportunities as others to avail of full paid employment.  This has been done fantastically through the likes of the WALK Peer programme and the work it has done in supporting young people with disabilities into the workforce.  I welcome the provision of &euro;2 million in 2017 for projects which provide pre-activation supports for people with disabilities.  However, we need to know where this money is going and the details of it.  We have asked repeatedly as to whether the WALK Peer programme will get funding next year.  Those involved in it do not know if they will.  The Minister and Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities have abdicated their responsibility in this regard, failing to give groups like WALK Peer an answer and certainty about their funding.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in the school meals programme, especially given the significant issue of child poverty experienced by families every day.  It is not news that parents are struggling to feed their children or to provide a warm home and sufficient clothing for them.  It is a stark reality for people out there.<\/p>  <p>  One measure which did not appear in this Bill is any increase to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  This is a missed opportunity.  Time and again, as September approaches, voluntary organisations are left to pick up the tab due to the Government's inaction on tackling back to school costs.  The struggle for parents to cover these costs year on year will continue unless there is an increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  I am sorry to see that my and others' calls to the Government to increase this payment were ignored.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the provision of paternity leave and benefit.<\/p><p>We welcomed and supported this Bill when it was brought forward ahead of the summer recess.  It is legislation that Sinn F&eacute;in had called for consistently and it is a welcome start in developing Ireland's parental leave practices.<\/p> <p> To be welcomed in this Bill is the extension of access to certain social welfare benefits for the self-employed, including farmers.  This, again, is a welcome first step in providing security for those who are self-employed when and if they need it.  The unchanged rate of PRSI for the self-employed is also to be welcomed.  We know that the self-employed have seen little or no support from the Government throughout the recession.  In many cases, unfortunately, a number of businesses did not survive.  We must support those who take a risk in setting up their own business and taking on employees.  I hope to see a further rolling out of social protection measures for the self-employed.<\/p> <p> Year on year, Sinn F&eacute;in provides a fully comprehensive alternative to the budget that is fully costed by the Department of Finance.  In this year's one, we addressed head on the real issues that the most vulnerable in society face annually.  A social welfare Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in would look very different from the one we are debating this evening.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not stand over discrimination against young people in our social welfare system.  In our alternative budget, we included a &euro;40 increase in the jobseeker's payment for the under-26s as part of its restoration over two budgets.  We also included the increase in the back-to-education allowance for under-26s to the full rate, and we welcome the fact that the Government has done this.<\/p> <p> For lone parents, we included an increase of 10% in the FIS and an increase in the cut-off age for the one-parent family payment to 12 years as a starting point.  Eventually, we would hope to restore it to its former level.  These measures would have directly targeted lone parents and in some way address the issues they face on a daily basis.<\/p> <p> When it comes to older people, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward an older persons package worth over &euro;410 million, including a three-week extension to the fuel allowance, a &euro;9.50 increase in the living-alone allowance, and reinstating the transitional pension for 65-year-olds, as well as further measures to address the inconsistencies within our pension system.  For those with disabilities, we proposed an increase of &euro;5.50 in the disability allowance and the blind person's pension.  With that, we also allocated &euro;1.1 million to secure and replicate the WALK PEER programme, which supports young people on disability allowance to move into paid positions of employment in the open labour market and further education or training in mainstream settings.<\/p> <p> The coming together of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il has done one thing well in that it has allowed them to see that they are, in fact, both the same.  Of course, this does not come as news to many of us.  Approaching this Social Welfare Bill and following on from the budget, we have seen two things - Fine Gael carrying the can for the continuation of the measures imposed by Fianna F&aacute;il before it, and Fianna F&aacute;il throwing its own party policies out the window and chasing after Fine Gael in every single thing it does.  The marriage of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il does work. It works for the developers and the bankers, it works well for the wealthy, it works for those who inherit rich estates and other inheritances, and it works well for the Ministers and the Government, who do not forget their own pay increases.  Let us be very clear, however, that the marriage of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il does not work for the ordinary people.  It does not work for young people, it does not work for lone parents, it does not work for our older citizens, and it certainly does not work for people with disabilities and children.<\/p> <p> The Social Welfare Bill in its present form does not do everything it could have done.  It is the result of a budget that further marginalises our young people, lone parents and those living alone.  As the main Opposition party here, Sinn F&eacute;in has little room to bring forward amendments to this Bill given the fact that, as an Opposition party, we cannot table amendments that constitute a charge on the Exchequer or on the public.  Having said that, it is my full intention to frame amendments in such a way as to bypass the restrictions so a proper debate can take place on the many issues that should have been dealt with in this Bill.  I look forward to a debate on Committee Stage.  We will certainly be tabling a number of amendments.  As I said at the start of my contribution, it is important that the record be set straight on the hot air blown into this Chamber by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It compounded the poverty levels of the very people it is in here talking about and trying to lift out of the poverty trap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800042#QQ00100","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478634900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Labour Party.  The Social Welfare Bill is very important.  It is fundamental in terms of giving legislative effect to the various measures relating to the social welfare system announced in the budget.  I welcome the first attempt at a social welfare Bill by the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, although it was somewhat unprecedented for a budget to be announced with no date for the payments to start until several weeks later.  It is encouraging that he has taken into account some of what we in the Labour Party proposed in our alternative budget.  We clearly welcome those measures.  The Minister has tried to spread the increases across nearly all categories but it is what he has left out that is most revealing.<\/p><p>I have been self-employed since 1980 so I must confess an interest.  I have always been on this hobbyhorse of how the self-employed were treated.  Many of the proposed increases and improvements to entitlements for the self-employed will not come into effect until much later in 2017.  For a long time, I have championed the cause of the 380,000 individuals affected.  This number is growing again.  It was 180,000 not too long ago.  I am glad to see the change is contributing to the drop in unemployment.  Those concerned are risk takers and innovators.  Not only that, they are also tax collectors for every Government.  They take on all the risk and employ people.  They have been badly treated and are not at the races in terms of benefits, apart from the contributory pension, to which they contribute until the age of 66.  The invalidity pension will not be extended to the self-employed until December 2017.While this will result in a saving, it could not have been left much later next year.  Given current developments, I wonder who will be Minister at that stage.<\/p><p>The improvements to the PRSI dental and optical benefits will not come into force until October.  The Minister has been playing games with many of these announcements. <\/p><p>I had better declare another conflict of interest.  I have a brother who is a councillor.  I was glad to see the changes for the councillors but I am beginning to wonder whether the focus has been on an event outside here rather than on something in here.  I was somewhat surprised that something that was debated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>from the time I was a councillor myself &ndash; I was a councillor for a number of years &ndash; did not find its way into the Social Welfare Bill <i>ab initio<\/i>, rather than coming in later as a Committee Stage amendment.  The whole place knows that what was going on with councillors was robbery.  They were paying 4% into a black hole and getting nothing in return.  I agree the Minister believes some benefit should derive from a contribution but councillors were treated very badly.  Now they have bigger administrative areas to cover.  I refer to municipal districts and other lunatic proposals that we implemented and that should be dumped at the first opportunity.  We have been asking councillors to travel vast distances.  I do not know the position in Limerick but I know about the geographical areas in Westmeath.  There are multiple meetings.  When I started off as a councillor, there were 13 or 14 meetings per year, and I am sure it was the same for Deputy Willie O'Dea.  Now there are that many every month.  I am glad about the Minister's measure but I do not like the way things are done.  The measures in the Bill should be up front; let them go, and let everybody in here nail his or her colours to the mast.  An awful lot of people in here are into funny money and talking about all sorts of things.<\/p><p>I was in government when the troika was coming in telling us to cut social welfare back to the rates that applied in Northern Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was in government at that time also.<\/p><p>We were borrowing money from the lender of last resort, the ECB.  The troika was telling us what to do, but we held out.  I will take no lessons from anyone who says that we did not.  We fought hard.  There were cuts but, by hell, people would really have seen cuts had the outside bodies implemented what they wanted to.  Deputy O'Dea was right, in that everything in the North just a few miles up the road was half the rate that it was in the South.  I recall the early morning meetings when we fought to try to protect rates.  We were in the last chance saloon.<\/p> <p> I come from a humble background.  I do not mind admitting it.  I would love to give more money to everyone, but it should only be enough to live while incentivising people to get out.  That is important.  We cannot create a poverty industry.  I do not subscribe to that.  I was the eldest of ten.  We had a small, menial wage coming into the house to keep us going.  There was no social welfare or crutch at that time in the 1950s and 1960s.<\/p> <p> As the Minister knows, I have been calling for improvements for the self-employed for some time.  During the worst of the economic recession, protection of the social welfare system was given the utmost priority by the previous Government, which had the Labour Party at its heart.  Almost &euro;20 billion was protected when cuts were happening everywhere.  I do not want to go into the history of that again.  We also commenced a policy of equalisation in the taxation treatment of the self-employed compared with employed people by increasing the earned income tax credit for the self-employed.  That policy of equity, fairness and justice must be completed.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has committed to this and money is scarce, but the sooner it is done, the better.<\/p> <p> As Deputy O'Dea knows from being an accountant, the self-employed have a case.  The PAYE allowance was implemented on a current year basis but self-employed people were treated on a previous year basis.  They are being treated on a current year basis now, but they are still not getting the same treatment.  If I were not a Deputy, I would bring a case on their behalf against the Departments of Finance and Social Protection, but that is another matter.  The Government would be ahead of people in that regard.  The self-employed were badly treated.<\/p> <p> As the economy improves, the Minister must ensure a level playing field for the self-employed.  I welcome the changes, but more needs to be done.  They are entitled to a safety net in the social welfare system for when they fall into personal difficulty such as illness or lose jobs unexpectedly, which was a common event during the recession.  I recall sitting in my clinics in Mullingar on cold Fridays trying to deal with self-employed people who had fallen ill but for whom nothing was available.  They provided valuable employment for others, but the first thing that the Department of Social Protection always did - in fairness to Deputy Burton, she rectified this - was ask them to account for everything that they had earned in the previous year.  That was like accounting for the snow that had fallen two years prior.  I used to get extremely angry about that.  I might as well be honest - we had many a heated parliamentary meeting about it until Deputy Burton made some amendments.  Everyone had the view that the self-employed were well off, but I can never forget that they provided a considerable amount of valuable employment for others.<\/p> <p> The self-employed are liable for PRSI payments under a class S rate of 4%, which entitles them to such benefits as the State contributory pension or the widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension.  The extension in the range of benefits is important, but the self-employed do not qualify for jobseeker's benefit irrespective of how long they have been making contributions.  They are compelled to seek recourse to the jobseeker's allowance, which is means tested.  For many, this is their first encounter with the social welfare system.  It can be an emotive and tortuous process, in so far as their assessments must reflect the incomes that they got from their businesses in the previous 12 months.  I hope that the Minister will apply fairness to the social welfare system in trying to achieve a just and equitable solution for the self-employed.  I believe that he is committed to doing so.<\/p> <p> Given the context of specific PRSI schemes underpinning the equality objective, the system should recognise self-employed people's position as employers as well as employees.  We must confront this issue in a positive and constructive way to address the plight of the self-employed.<\/p> <p> There is still no entitlement to illness benefit or jobseeker's benefit despite the fact that, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, it is available in other EU countries.  The Minister is not afraid of change, but departmental bureaucrats are always afraid of it and of trying something that they have never tried before because there could be \"ramifications\" and so on.  This must be addressed.  Self-employed people are more likely to fall ill because many of them are out in the rain and snow working hard.  They cannot come inside because, unlike years ago, they have no set times or hours.  The Minister must let us know what his plans are in this regard.  I hope that it is not just window dressing.  I do not believe that it is.<\/p> <p> The changes are welcome, but what about those payments that the Minister did not increase?  I must address some of them.  Deputy Brady referred to a number of them.  The Social Welfare Bill is disappointing for me and the Labour Party because it does nothing to address children living in poverty.  There was an argument during the summer about a &euro;5 increase.  Deputy O'Dea ensured that he got some plaudits.  That is politics.  When one has been around here for as long as he has, one makes sure to fight one's corner.  There were wins for some people, but there was nothing for children.  The Bill fails to provide any increase in those payments that make the most difference to those with children and who live in poverty.  The Bill shows little vision about how to address child poverty.  Social transfers are critical to solving the problem, but nothing has been done to address it.<\/p> <p> From child benefit and family income supplement, FIS, to the qualified child increase, no increase in respect of children has been provided to the front line of helping parents on social welfare.  Someone asked what the Government had against children, given that it did nothing in the budget for those most in need.  The budget package outlines no ambition or vision for addressing child poverty.  Choices were to be made in the budget.  The Government made some that were right, which is only natural, but it was wrong in this regard.  According to a recent UNICEF report, children are now the most neglected group in Irish society.<\/p> <p> Many options for addressing child poverty could have been considered by the Government, but the budget made a clear statement on where the Government stood by making no increases in the payments that made the most difference to children.  The Minister managed to find money - I appreciate that it is not easy, as I was there five or six years ago - to increase nearly every payment and extend multiple benefits.  Thankfully, some of those were for the self-employed.  However, he failed even to consider others.  FIS, child benefit and domiciliary care allowance play a critical role in addressing child poverty and supporting low-income families.  The increase for a qualified child is the most targeted payment in our social welfare system.  It is given to those who are in receipt of social welfare payments and who are raising children.  Means tested, it is worth &euro;29.80 per week.  I must ask a question.  Does the Minister believe that this weekly amount is sufficient to raise a child?  He could have made a real difference to those children who are at risk of poverty by increasing the rate.  Even a small increase of &euro;3 or &euro;4 would have made a significant difference, as it would amount to approximately &euro;200 per year, which could be critical where children are at risk of poverty.<\/p> <p> The back to work family dividend, which is linked to the qualified child increase, has not been increased either.  It was a novel and worthwhile introduction in its time.  By adding a few euro, the Minister could have made a substantial and targeted difference.  It would have given extra support to lone parents and those who were trying to return to work.  As seen in the small weekly increase for those aged under 26 years, though, the Government does not care too much for young people or children who need family income support.<\/p> <p> The Government increased the minimum wage by 10 cent per hour - this was recommended by the commission, but the increase was miserly - but did not provide any increase in the rate of FIS.  This will create difficulties because families dependent on FIS will suffer a real decrease.  During the crisis, FIS supported many low-paid families to remain in work and has been a critical part in making sure that work always pays.  In Fine Gael's circles, the Minister and his colleagues may not be aware of the importance of FIS, but it plays a key role in supporting families in low-paid jobs.  Despite increasing the minimum wage, FIS rates have been left unchanged and there has been limited comment on this important issue.  In last year's budget, the limits for the first two children were increased by &euro;5 each, taking the payment to &euro;511 and &euro;612.  As the Minister should know, FIS provides 60% of the difference between one's salary and the cap.  Given that there has been no increase in the cap, those on the minimum wage will see a reduction in the amount that they receive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800043#RR00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478635500,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I regret that I must interrupt the Deputy, but we must adjourn the debate.

I was hoping that the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party would accept the motion.  I note that Ministers, Ministers of State and the Taoiseach have said they will not accept the pay increases, which is interesting and I welcome that fact.  However, they do not seem to want to extend it to Members of this D&aacute;il, which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to explain.  <\/p><p>This is an issue of fairness.  The Minister may disagree, which he is entitled to do, but for me, this is a core issue of fairness.  It is also an issue of leadership.  I have listened to the Minister's utterances in the last number of weeks on public sector pay and on the reasonable demands that are being made by workers right across the public sector, be they garda&iacute;, nurses or teachers.  They are demanding that core issues are dealt with, most particularly the issue of equal work for equal pay but the Minister is not in a position to say that he will commit to that, implement and deliver it.  He is preaching pay restraint to public sector workers earning less than &euro;65,000 who are not getting any realistic levels of pay restoration.  At the same time, he is presenting an agreement which prioritises pay restoration for those earning more than &euro;65,000, including Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.<\/p><p>Let us look at the figures.  A Deputy is paid a salary of &euro;87,258 per year.  I believe that Deputies should be, and are, reasonably well paid.  We earn a salary which is 2.5 times the average industrial wage.  The situation is that on 1 April next - whatever genius civil servant came up with that date did not do irony - or on April Fool's Day, those earning more than &euro;65,000, including Deputies, will get the first tranche of their pay restoration, followed by the second tranche on 1 January 2018.  That means that Deputies will receive an increase of &euro;5,400 or &euro;100 per week.  Average public sector workers, those who work on the front line like garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers, those who clean the streets, who work in our local authorities and so forth, are on an average salary of &euro;40,000 and will get &euro;1,000 in pay restoration, equivalent to &euro;20 per week.  When one takes taxes into account, the amount is actually a lot less.  Deputies and those earning more than &euro;65,000 will get &euro;100 per week.  How can the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sit there and say that is fair?  <\/p><p>  The excuse used by the Minister to justify this is that Deputies' pay is linked to grades in the civil service and in that he is correct.  However, so too is the pay of Ministers, Ministers of State and the Taoiseach.  If the principle is so precious, how is it that the Government is able to break it for Ministers?  The Government knows that it simply would not wash that Ministers and Ministers of State would take the proposed increases, which for Ministers would have been 10% and for the Taoiseach, up to 14%.  The Government knew this would not wash and could not be justified and it was right about that.  I welcome the fact that the Government acknowledges this and that Ministers are not taking the pay increase.  However, Deputies seem to be special and can be treated differently but I do not believe that is justifiable or right. <\/p><p>The Minister cannot come into this House, as he has done in the past, and argue that we cannot do this because Deputies cannot set their own pay levels or break the parity between civil servants' pay and that of politicians when the Government is breaking that parity in the context of Ministers, and rightly so.  That is a red herring and the Minister knows it.  There is nothing stopping Deputies from collectively taking a decision in this House on this matter.  This is a time when we have huge industrial unrest and genuine grievances among public sector workers whose demands are not being met by the Minister or the Government.  Despite several attempts by Deputy Adams and others to get the Government to commit to the principle of equal work for equal pay, the Government says &quot;No&quot;, turns its back and will not give such a commitment.  It is telling those who came into the public sector in 2011, who are doing the same work for less pay, that it will not deal with them, that they will have to wait.  There is no timeframe for when the Government will deal with this issue but when it comes to Deputies, there is certainty and pay restoration.  How can the Minister justify pay restoration for those earning more than &euro;65,000 but not for those earning less than that amount?  That is what I mean by fairness and leadership.  <\/p><p>The Government, in this year's budget, increased the minimum wage by 10 cent per hour.  The lowest paid workers in this State were given a pay increase of 10 cent per hour but Deputies will get &euro;100 per week.  There are many people for whom an increase of &euro;100 per week is unimaginable but for Deputies, it is a reality.  The public cannot understand how that can be possible when we have the real problems that are pressing down on so many families in this State.  Budget 2017 was known as the &quot;fiver budget&quot; - a fiver for those on welfare and a fiver for most people, including Deputies, who will also benefit from the tax cuts in the budget.  However, there is an additional bonus for us in the form of pay restoration of &euro;100 per week.  It is simply not fair.<\/p><p>The Minister needs to commit to a new pay agreement and to realise that the Lansdowne Road agreement is dead in the water.  He also needs to realise that it is simply not fair or sustainable to stumble on until September 2018 with his head in the sand, pretend that what is happening around him is not happening, hope all the noise will go away, that the reasonable demands from nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers will go away and do deals here and there that will get him over a hump or through a week or two.  It will not work.  The Minister is facing real discontent if he does not face up to the real sores in the public service at the moment.  <\/p><p>The Minister must put this in the context of our public services.  The difference between my party and Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il is that we value public services.  We want genuine, world class public services.  We want to invest in our health service, to make sure that those who are working in it get the best possible support and are operating in hospitals that have sufficient bed capacity.  We want schools that have proper buildings rather than prefabs.  That is the vision we have.  We want world class public services and we want decent pay and equality for public servants.  This Government turns its face against that but when it comes to Deputies' pay, anything is possible.  Pay restoration for Deputies is written in stone and cannot be undone but in reality, it can.  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have made it clear that we will not be taking this pay increase.  I have listened to some of the responses from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies on this issue and they get very defensive about it.  I raised this issue with the Minister previously and he asked me what I do with my money.  In asking such a question, the Minister is trying to conflate separate issues.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have never said that we do not draw down our full salaries from the State.  I draw down my full salary of &euro;87,258 and I use some of it to employ somebody in my constituency.  That is what I do but that does not have an impact on the taxpayer.  Accepting this pay increase of &euro;5,400, however, would have an impact on the taxpayer.  It would impose an increased cost on the Exchequer but worse than that - and this is what the Minister does not understand - it would demonstrate a very poor lack of judgment and leadership on my part.  The Minister and his Government came into this House and presented a budget that gave &euro;5 to the most vulnerable and to most working families but did not deal with the real issues and challenges in health, housing, child care and so on.  The Government is telling public servants, who are doing a fantastic job on the front line, that they will have to wait.  It preaches wage restraint and argues that pay equality cannot be achieved because the country cannot afford it.  It seems we cannot afford any of these things but we can afford pay increases for Deputies.<\/p><p>That is as much a matter for Fianna F&aacute;il as it is for Fine Gael.  We have a chance here tonight and tomorrow when the vote is taken to say collectively in one voice, as Members of this Parliament, that we believe in fairness and are showing leadership and that at a time when reasonable demands are being made by those in the public sector earning less than &euro;65,000 per year that are not being met by the Government, we do not believe we can accept these wages increases.  It simply would not be fair.  At a time when so many other things are happening, we have so many other demands and when the Minister says \"No\" and turns his face to them, it would be wrong and send out entirely the wrong message if this should happen.  I appeal to Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party, which says it is the party of working people, to support our motion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800045#TT00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478636700,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  We have a clear choice before us tonight with the proposal from our party.  We have a choice between giving leadership and good example and putting more money in our pockets.  Those of us who have a good salary should not demand more.  Deputies have take-home pay of between &euro;45,000 and &euro;50,000 out of a salary of &euro;87,000.  That is enough for anybody and we should not be demanding &euro;5,400 more.  We should not jump the queue while low-paid public servants, many of whom depend on family income supplement, wait.  The question for all 158 Deputies here is do we actually need it?  I do not and I know that very few other people in the House can say honestly that we need another &euro;5,000 in our pockets.  Public servants on &euro;35,000, &euro;36,000 or &euro;37,000 will get an increase of roughly &euro;1,000 while we line up and take over &euro;5,000.  That is not fair.  People on the minimum wage will receive an increase of 10 cent per hour in January.  That is awful.  What kind of message does that send out to the people passing on the street here?  What kind of message does that send out to the public?  I have heard young teachers and young public servants being lectured in recent weeks - lectured by us.  They are being lectured by people in here who are prepared to have that kind of inequality.<\/p>  <p>  Under a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, the minimum wage for someone working 39 hours per week was cut but that has been restored.  Ten cent per hour is an insult and the figure should be increased.  Only those on middle and low incomes should get an increase.  We need to reduce pay for top earners and increase it for those with the lowest incomes.  The first in the queue should be clerical officers, manual workers in the public service and what are termed the lower grades.  People on &euro;22,000 or &euro;23,000 per year should get the largest increase.  Half of workers in this State earn less than &euro;28,000 gross per annum.  This translates into take-home pay of about &euro;400 or less per week.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to create a society based on solidarity, not greed.  What better place to start than in here?  We should take the lead.  There have a clear choice here tonight for Deputies.  We either want to lead by example or operate by double standards.  I appeal to people across the political divide to do the right thing.  The money saved, which is a modest amount, could be used for homeless services.  If you walk out through that gate here tonight, you will fall over people whose feet are hanging out of doorways - unfortunate people who are forced to sleep rough.  Money should be put into services like that, not into our pockets.  Let us not lecture garda&iacute;, young teachers, young nurses and low-paid public service workers.  Let us try to create some equality and start with it here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800046#UU00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1478636700,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I understand there are three people left to speak.

Mar a d&uacute;irt cainteoir&iacute; eile, the proposed salary increase for Deputies will bring their salaries to over &euro;92,600 over the next 18 months.  Ministers are in line to do even better.  They will get &euro;4,000 per year over the next two and a half years, an extra &euro;11,735 in total.  Not to be outdone, the Taoiseach is in line to do even better.  He will get almost &euro;5,000 per year next year, the year after and the year after that bringing his salary or that of his successor up to &euro;200,000.  This is at a time when young people have been told by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il that all they are worth is an extra &euro;2.70 per week and pensioners, carers, citizens with disabilities and others in receipt of social welfare are told they are worth just &euro;5 extra per week.<\/p>  <p>  This is not acceptable or fair.  Deputies earn a basic salary of &euro;87,258.  We are very well paid.  It is a wage the majority of workers will never earn.  All the time, Ministers are telling garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers to stop legitimately asking when their pay will be restored.  They are arguing to get their pay restored.  The average public sector worker on &euro;40,000 per year will get pay restoration of &euro;1,000 and the Government expects such workers to roll over and accept this, while Deputies will be paid &euro;92,000 per year.  A stop can be put to this tonight if Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il step up to the plate and show an ounce of leadership.  Sin an rud ceart agus an rud cothrom le d&eacute;anamh.

Where are the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies this evening?  Are they hiding?  Are they hiding in their offices, are they sitting at home with their feet up watching this or are they hiding in the D&aacute;il bar laughing and joking about this?  Why do they not have the courage of their convictions to come in here and stand up and say why they feel they have a right to reward themselves a pay rise of &euro;5,400 on top of a salary of &euro;87,000?  Why are they not here to stand up and defend what it is that makes them so special above everybody else?  We all know that Ireland is experiencing a two-tier recovery but this measure compounds the wealth divide even further.  In last month's budget, we saw Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il slapping each other's backs congratulating each other on throwing pensioners &euro;5.  Sure it was the best you could do, lads.  Public servants who earn under &euro;60,000 will get a pay rise of &euro;1,000 over the next two years.  Meanwhile, Deputies feel entitled to pocket and pilfer &euro;5,400 over two years on top of a salary of &euro;87,000.  I would tell those who are here and others who are absent to go back to their constituents - the workers who earn the minimum wage, the workers who are on zero-hours contracts, the newly qualified teachers, the nurses, the garda&iacute; and the people who are hounding job centres day in and day out looking for work but who cannot get it - and tell them what it is that makes them feel so special and above everybody else that they deserve a salary of &euro;92,000.  Have they become so aloof and detached from any semblance of fairness and equality?  Have they got to the stage that they actually think this is fair or just?  New politics, my backside.  It is the same old, same old.<\/p>  <p>  In any other country, this type of greed would be seen as a scandal and rightly so.  In Ireland, it is just more of the same.  We have got used to the self-serving greed of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  There is only one Fianna F&aacute;il Member here out of 50.  I ask him to do the right thing and try to show the people that Fianna F&aacute;il is no longer up to its neck in self-serving greed and sleveen politics and to back this motion.  <\/p><p> The issue we are discussing is whether Deputies should be paid a salary of &euro;92,000 or to continue with the &euro;87,000 salary we are currently being paid.  I have two questions for any Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy who intends to vote in favour of this pay rise and a salary of &euro;92,000.  Is &euro;87,000 not enough for them?  What makes them think they need an extra &euro;5,400?  It would be interesting to hear Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Members stand up tonight and answer those questions.  We all know the country is struggling.  The recovery is happening, but very few are experiencing it.  The vast majority of people in the State have seen no real benefit from recovery.

I emphasise the Government's absolute support for the Lansdowne Road agreement and for all those unions that are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement.  I acknowledged earlier, as did the Taoiseach in response to questions from Deputies earlier in the House, that the ruling from the Labour Court last Thursday night regarding the resolution of matters facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was made by an independent body that has served the State very well in dealing with industrial relations challenges the country faces.  The Government, of course, accepts the recommendation it has made.<\/p><p>I also acknowledge that this recommendation will have consequences.  On foot of that, yesterday I began engaging with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which has made its views known.  I met representatives from ICTU to reaffirm the Government's support for a collective agreement which is the Lansdowne Road agreement.  More than ever, I wish to make it clear that the only way for the State to respond to the industrial relations challenges and the need for economic stability is in a collective and an overall manner.  It is for this reason that the Government remains as committed as ever to the Lansdowne Road agreement and will be engaging with the parties to that agreement to ensure it is maintained.  I do this in the context of the many risks and challenges we face from abroad and it is even more important that, in the context of Ireland's small and open economy, we have an ordered way in which we can plan our affairs.  That is acknowledged in this motion.<\/p> <p> I heard Sinn F&eacute;in speakers disparage a &euro;5 increase in the different social welfare rates.  This was the first increase in the rates since 2009 and it happened due to the change in our economy that Sinn F&eacute;in said would never happen.  However, that change did happen.  I acknowledge that a &euro;5 contribution can make a difference to people but I also acknowledge that they need more and there are needs out there to which the Government and the D&aacute;il-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800047#VV05100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478637900,"counter":520,"content":"<p>What about &euro;100?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800048#WW00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1478637900,"counter":521,"content":"<p>-----must respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800048#WW00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1478637900,"counter":522,"content":"<p>The Minister's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800048#WW00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1478637900,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I understand fully the nature of those needs.

This is an independence that is international and which is also done in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  That link is important because it means that Deputies or Senators cannot, on a whim, give themselves an increase at a time of their own choosing.  That link is utterly independent of the political process and political input.  It means that we took cuts when cuts were taking place in the general public service.  I acknowledge that the level of our wages is extremely significant but the people here work hard for that and they take the wage that is going.  It is important to say that the salary being recovered will bring it back to a level of &euro;92,000, the salary that was paid to Deputies in 2011, 2012 and 2013 when it was paid to many members of the current Sinn F&eacute;in Parliamentary Party.

The Minister agreed to the establishment of the public service pay commission in the confidence-and-supply agreement signed last May.  During the summer, however, a number of issues relating to the Garda and the teaching profession were placed on the long finger and this has resulted in a major breach of trust between a large number of the public service unions and the Government.  Many of those issues were non-pay related and had no impact on the matters we debate this evening.  For example, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality guaranteed access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court for the Garda in early summer but did not proceed with this.  That forced the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors to reverse its decision to support the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Government has failed to come to the table with proposals on junior certificate reform that the ASTI could implement and accept.  Now the Government has made an issue of the Croke Park hours, has forced ASTI into justifying its position on these and has forced its members out onto the streets.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the agreement itself has shown delivery with regard to allowances and a pathway for the lower paid teachers.  The Government, however, does not wish to reflect the spirit of the agreement in committing itself to equality of pay.  All of that has combined to create the perfect storm which we are facing this evening and which has utterly undermined the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Minister and his colleagues must take responsibility for where matters stand, particularly in the context of how the public service and public service pay issues have been mishandled since last May.  What we now need to see is a pathway to how the Government is going to manage this.  It cannot be the make-it-up as you go along approach that has been presented to us since last Friday morning.  We need an actual pathway with a number of initiatives that will rebuild the trust that has been broken.  That rebuilding must be done in a cohesive and coherent fashion.  In turn, this would allow the unions to engage with the Government and represent their members' interests in a cohesive manner that would take account of the challenges the State is facing - such as those relating to Brexit - and what it may face tomorrow in the aftermath of the US election results this evening.  The Government rapidly needs to restore confidence in its ability to manage the situation or that confidence will disappear.<\/p>  <p>  When the issue of politicians pay was dealt with by politicians - and the Leas Ceann Comhairle was in the House at that time - it did not serve politicians or public life well.  It is better dealt with in the absence of politician's involvement.  It is better dealt with by people who are not part of the bubble that is Leinster House, namely, those who look on coldly and observe.  In the past, these individuals recommended cuts.  If they recommend such cuts again, we will accept them.  As long as those to whom I refer are independent and not subject to political interference, we will always support their decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800048#WW02500","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1478637900,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I shall carry on where my colleague Deputy Calleary left off by stating that the key in respect of this issue is independence.

It is very disingenuous to send out the message that we are afraid to discuss our salaries.  This is not the case.

I do not have a difficulty with being here and discussing this, because there is nothing to hide.  I was thinking about the time when politicians had control over voting their own pay rises.  I did some research on this and I could not see any time when they had control themselves until the year 2000 when they actually decided to take a reduction in wages.  This reduction has happened and now we have the restoration of this pay.<\/p>  <p>  I also have a serious difficulty with politicians, from every party or independent - I am not referring just to Sinn F&eacute;in - who go around telling the public and the media they will not take this rise, when some of them have two or three businesses with far greater sources of income.  This proposal is very rich coming from individuals who do this.  I am a new Deputy and I do not hold any of my old jobs.  I was partly involved in a business and another job but that is no longer the case.  I rely totally on the good salary from this job and the expenses.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the House about a Deputy in a rural constituency.  I have opened my third office and my expenses will not cover the cost of it.  To give my constituents a proper service I must delve into my salary to cover the cost of the third office.  When we open our first office every Deputy is generously helped out and that is fair enough.  I am in the rural constituency of Roscommon-Galway, which is more than 100 miles long, and I have opened my third constituency office.  I have one in my home town of Strokestown, I have one in Roscommon town and, as Deputy Anne Rabbitte knows, I have opened one in Ballinasloe.  There is a huge cost factor in doing this and many Deputies are aware of this..  I do not know how Sinn F&eacute;in does its calculations, it is entitled to do whatever it does, but I am sure Sinn F&eacute;in pays for the rent of its office through another way and it comes out of D&aacute;il salary expenses.  It might be done differently, or different from the way other Deputies in the House do it, but it is the same thing.<\/p>  <p>  We must pay for rent and conferences.  I organised a blood conference and I had to pay for all of it.  I could not cover it with my expenses; I had to use some of my wages to cover it.  I have no problem with this.  The constituents of Roscommon-Galway elected me and I will spend the money to give them the service they deserve.  My staff and I will ensure our offices are open five days a week and sometimes at weekends.  There is much expense involved in this.  Like many other Deputies and councillors - we do not talk about it - we give generous amounts of money to voluntary groups and charities.  That is never mentioned.  I make these points not in a whingeing way and not giving out because we must do it.  I am glad I have the salary and the expenses to do it.  It is very important this point is made here this evening.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to public sector pay, I am glad there is some light at the end of the tunnel in the Garda dispute, but in the Chamber this evening I urge that the ASTI think of the students.  I know many of them are very annoyed and hurt at how the Government has handled this issue.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has not handled it well, if we are to be honest.  I urge the teachers for the sake of the students to try to get back into the classrooms, particularly for those gearing up for exams who must start work on them.  We urge the ASTI to go back into the classrooms and to suspend this.  We can all see where they are coming from and recognise some of the difficulties but we all acknowledge that the only show in town at present is the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Perhaps through this there can be some give or take, or perhaps even a strong statement from the Minister at this stage.  I know that Ed Byrne, the president of the ASTI, said a number of weeks ago that if the Minister indicated certain things in a public statement it might progress this issue.  I urge all sides to bring this to a conclusion as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800049#XX00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1478638500,"counter":553,"content":"<p>It is open to every party to use its Private Member's time in whatever way it wishes, but it is disappointing that Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to politicise Deputies pay and the implementation of the Lansdowne Road agreement itself.  The same Deputies take every cent of pay, expenses and allowances available to fund their political activity.  Sinn F&eacute;in elected representatives take pay, expenses and allowances from four different parliaments, namely, the Oireachtas, Stormont, Westminster where they do not turn up for work and the European Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  More than a decade ago the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector recommended that the salary of a Deputy be linked to the maximum point on the principal officer's scale.  This removed Deputies' pay from the remit of votes in the D&aacute;il where Deputies were expected to vote for or against pay increases for themselves.  This practice was rightly found to be unacceptable and was rightly changed.  Deputies' pay should never be decided by votes in the House but rather by an independent process.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, which benchmarked the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy to that of a principal officer in the Civil Service was very reasonable and balanced.  Under FEMPI legislation and the Haddington Road agreement, Deputies' pay was rightly cut during the financial crisis.  From a peak of more than &euro;100,000 per annum, Deputies' pay was reduced by &euro;13,000.  The salary is now subject to the 4% class K PRSI contribution and the pension levy where it previously was not.<\/p>  <p>  The allowances paid to Deputies were also rightly reduced and are now much more transparent.  I am not denying it is still a well-paid job, but this type of populist motion about politicians' pay will not resolve the industrial relations disputes under way in the State.  The Labour Party has called for the Government to open discussions on a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  We have also called for the re-establishment of an employer-labour conference to act to ensure disputes between employers and trade unions do not become a full-blown crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The House would be much better served debating practical solutions to the issues of the day which we now face in industrial relations rather than wasting time on symbolic gestures such as this motion.  The Labour Party continues to support the principle that politicians should no longer decide their own pay and that it should continue to be linked to the salary of a principal officer in the Civil Service.  Is there truly an argument for principal officers in the Civil Service not to have pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road agreement?  If not, and I have not heard one, I do not see the argument or logic for Deputies doing so.<\/p>  <p>  We considered not contributing to this time waster of a motion this evening so this is as much as we are willing to contribute on the debate.

We believe the pay of public representatives should be linked to that of those they represent.  In this way, public representatives would have an incentive to improve the lot of the majority.  Part of the disconnect between politics and the majority of people is in the fact that the material circumstances of public representatives, in our case Deputies and Ministers, are on a different planet from those of the majority of those whom they represent.<\/p>  <p>  Against that background, it is a no-brainer for us to state that it is unacceptable for Deputies to receive a &euro;5,000 increase when somebody on the minimum wage gets an extra 10 cent an hour.  Some 23% of workers in this country are officially low paid, a figure that has dramatically increased in recent years, and people on social welfare and pensioners got a miserable &euro;5 extra per week, while a young jobseeker got even less at half of that - an utterly miserable increase.  Secondary schools across the country are closed and may be closed for quite a long period if this Government does not relent, instead of refusing to pay the &euro;6 per week extra per teacher that was promised to them under the Haddington Road agreement.  The Government reneged on a promise, not the teachers - as suggested by the Taoiseach earlier today.  The teachers stuck to the agreement and wanted to be paid &euro;6 per week per teacher, some &euro;300 per year, but it has been decided that we cannot pay that.  We are willing to allow the schools of the country to close and to lock teachers and students out but it is okay for Deputies to get an extra &euro;5,000 to take them up to the extremely well-paid salary of &euro;92,000.  That is unacceptable but the Government, and the political establishment of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, do not understand how unjust it is.<\/p>  <p>  I heard somebody say that Deputies worked hard and that is true but so do people who work in Tesco.  So do nurses and many of them, I suspect, work a lot harder than Deputies.  So do teachers and so do firemen.  So do the ushers in this House, who will leave here an hour or two after we leave and who also do not have equal pay for equal work.  It is not just the teachers and nurses who do not get equal pay.  A teacher who joined after 2012 gets approximately &euro;6,000 less for doing the same job than somebody who was already employed.  We are going to give ourselves a &euro;5,000 increase but we cannot give it to low-paid nurses or teachers or the ushers here who will leave an hour or two after we have all gone.  Their family lives are often wrecked by the ever-changing hours in this House but it is okay to do that to them and to teachers, nurses and other public servants.  I do not think that is acceptable.  It is important to give them a shout out because they make this place function as public servants, like teachers and nurses make the State function.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government forces this through we will publish where we are giving the extra money to.  If it is next week, we will give it to the ASTI strike fund; if it is next year and the nurses are on strike, we will give it to them and we will publish other good causes where we will put our money.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800050#YY00100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478639100,"counter":555,"content":"<p>An English billionaire once insulted half of the world's working population when he said, &quot;If you pay peanuts you will get monkeys.&quot;  Of course, the extremely generous wages paid to Deputies have never been a guarantee against monkey business in this House but it has guaranteed a D&aacute;il that is out of touch with the lived experience of ordinary people.  How many Deputies will get through Christmas only with the help of St. Vincent de Paul?  How many had to count the pennies this year just to scrape a holiday?  How many simply cannot afford private health care?<\/p><p>On over &euro;87,000, Deputies are a privileged lot.  Workers who perform vital work and without whom society could not properly function such as nurses, bus drivers and others, are paid only a fraction of the wage of a Deputy.  Many young teachers, trusted to educate the next generation, are paid less than their workplace colleagues and, needless to say, no such sanction applies to new Deputies.  The worker on the minimum wage receives four and a half times less pay than a Deputy and the person on social welfare receives nine times less.  The Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party, however, defend not just the <i>status quo<\/i>but a big wage increase, which is more than 12 times the wage increase of the minimum wage worker, ten times that of the person on social welfare and significantly more than workers in the categories I mentioned, without whom society could not properly function.  It is wrong and we will support the motion this evening.<\/p><p>We are also tabling an amendment to insert the words, &quot;...further acknowledges that elected representatives who truly wish to represent the interests of working class people should live on no more than the average industrial wage;...&quot; after the words &quot;...effect on the majority of households; and...&quot;.  This amendment is not so much for the benefit of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies, who represent the interests of big business, big farmers and the wealthy in society who have no interest in living on the average industrial wage.  It is inserted precisely for those Deputies whose aim is to truly represent working-class people.  Those Deputies must be able not just to talk the talk but to walk the walk - to walk in the shoes of the working people they seek to represent.  That is why Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit Deputies live on no more than the average industrial wage.  We are workers' Deputies on workers' wages.  Even if this motion is defeated and the wage increases go ahead, our Deputies will not personally benefit by even one penny.  Rather than hand the money back to Deputy Michael Noonan to pay bondholders and to provide tax breaks for landlords and big builders, we will donate every penny to campaigns aimed at improving life for ordinary working people.  We will donate to community campaigns such as the anti-water charge movement, to progressive campaigns such as the repeal movement and to strike funds for working people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800050#YY00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1478639100,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Connolly of Independents 4 Change has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800050#YY00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1478639100,"counter":557,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l a fhios agam an mbeidh aon duine eile ag labhairt.

On this occasion, however, I do not support them as I think this is the lowest type of politics.  As I sat in my office preparing for tomorrow and waiting for my turn tonight, I found myself listening in agreement to some of the comments made by Deputy Anne Rabbitte.  I have spent an incredible amount of time in this Chamber since I was elected, partly because I am a new Deputy and partly because I have been watching and listening, but I find this level of politics, of split and divide, despicable.  I will support Sinn F&eacute;in and the groups on the Left on other motions but not on this one.  I was absolutely disgusted two weeks ago when Sinn F&eacute;in and the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit supported Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he decided that we should not take last week off.  If one really thought about the staff in this Chamber and in the building, this was a golden opportunity for Sinn F&eacute;in and the AAA-PBP to show some bottle and stand up for them.  They could have stood by what the Business Committee had agreed and brought back some honesty into politics rather than playing to the lowest common denominator in which politicians are lazy and have continuous holidays.<\/p><p>Like most Deputies my day started today a little later than usual at 8 a.m.  It is now 9 p.m. and I will continue to work until 11 p.m.  I make no apologies for that and I do not seek any sympathy in that regard.  I made a choice to change career and to seek election to the D&aacute;il to represent people.  It is disingenuous, if not dishonest, to say that I cannot represent working class people, middle class people and upper class people if I do not have a working wage of the type referred to by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.  I think that is an insult and I do not think people want that type of politics.  We are here to do a job.  We promised a new type of politics and to stand up and be counted.  I receive a salary for which I make no apology.  I can adopt the high moral ground, although I do not wish to do so, because as I made known prior to the tabling of this Sinn F&eacute;in motion, I will not be taking the increase.  One is not here to adopt the high moral ground; one is here to hold the system to account for a fairer country.  We should be working to provide employment, housing and health services for all of our citizens.  From the day I was elected to this House and until the day I leave, that is the voice I have been and will be in this Chamber.<\/p> <p> I believe there are solutions.  I also believe that this discussion tonight is beyond contempt.  I rarely use such strong language, except in regard to the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties.  On this occasion, I find myself in agreement with them that the salary is what it is.  Those who do not want it do not have to take it.  The Sinn F&eacute;in, Anti-Austerity Alliance and People Before Profit Deputies take the full salary and they use it as they see fit.

I could not agree more with Deputy Catherine Connolly that this motion is nothing more than a populist stunt.  The work of the Business Committee was hijacked a couple of weeks ago by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin but the Sinn F&eacute;in representative on that committee had also agreed the business for that week and then voted against it.  That is populism at its best.  During my contribution on the budget I declared that I would not be taking the &euro;5,000 per annum increase for myself and that I intended to give it to charitable organisations in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, this motion is nothing short of naked populism.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies may not be taking the money for themselves but they are putting it into their campaigns, as are the Anti-Austerity Alliance and all the other hard left Deputies, many of whom are so hard now they do not know what they feel.  They talk about the poor and people who have nothing.  We all witnessed the near riot they caused during the water protests with no regard to the costs in that regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Despite all their talk last week about supporting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many of them and their supporters were outside this House spitting at the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  What we need is a modicum of fair play.  We cannot have salaries set by Deputies.  They were set by us for long enough.  That was a charade and it was not right or acceptable.  Now Deputies' salaries are linked to the infamous Lansdowne Road agreement and the principal officer grade.  Many Deputies might be willing to give up the proposed salary increase but what about the principal officers?  There are only 158 of us but there are many hundreds of principal officers and other higher officers.  In an interview this morning with Sean O'Rourke, his lordship, Jack O'Connor, huffed and puffed and refused to answer any of the questions he was asked while proclaiming the Lansdowne Road agreement to be better than the kingdom come.  We are told now that even though this salary increase is provided under the Lansdowne Road agreement, we should not take it.  This is populism.  Sinn F&eacute;in members take their salaries from the European Parliament, the Stormont Assembly and from the British Parliament, which its members do not even attend, and they put it into their campaigns.<\/p>  <p>  I know of a Deputy who five years ago tried to rent an office in Deputy Cullinane's constituency in Waterford.  He could not afford it but four days later it was rented by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Do they expect us to believe they are paying the high rents in constituencies like Dungarvan, Tramore and so on out of their so-called industrial wage?  They are not.  I heard Deputy Eugene Murphy of Fianna F&aacute;il say earlier that he had opened three offices.  More power to him.  Our job is to serve the public.  We are Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la elected by the people and we should never forget it.  We are not naked populists that want to jump on every bandwagon and have every type of issue hijacked and banjaxed and so on.  That is the reason Sinn F&eacute;in did not make the strides in the election it expected to make.  The electorate is clever enough to know that they need to elect people who will represent them.  I am not speaking in this regard only about farmers.  I represent every person in my constituency to the best of my ability and I will continue to do so for as long as they elect me, whether they are unemployed or working people.  I will not engage in the type of populism or charade in which Sinn F&eacute;in is engaged.

For Deputies to take a pay rise at this time is totally wrong and unacceptable.  It is totally unjust that those on social welfare payments will be getting an extra &euro;260 per annum while Deputies will get a &euro;2,700 increase this year and next year.  If, following the vote this Thursday, this motion is not passed, I propose to set up a trust fund and to give the money to community and voluntary organisations in west Cork.  I call on other like-minded Deputies to do the same.  The money allocated for the pay rise amounts to more than &euro;1 million over the two years.  I propose that this money be ring-fenced for health services, specifically home help packages and services.  As we know, many elderly people are being refused home help hours and home care packages despite the promises made by the Government.  How can we justify increasing our pay when the Government has not made good on these promises?  Let us stick to our promise and allocate this money to home help services and home care packages and thereby take care of some of the most vulnerable in society.  This money would be an enormous boost to elder care provision and would go a long way towards helping the elderly to remain in their homes for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  While &euro;2,700 per annum will not make a huge difference to the standard of living of Deputies and Senators, &euro;1 million over two years will make an enormous difference to the most vulnerable in society.

It is unacceptable that Deputies and Senators should get a partial unwinding of FEMPI pay reductions through the Lansdowne Road agreement while other groups have to threaten industrial, take to the streets in protest and have recourse to the Labour Court or the Workplace Relations Commission to get some restoration of their pay.  By all means allow higher civil servants or principal officers have some restoration of their FEMPI cuts if that is what is provided for in the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p><p>However, as legislators who introduced the FEMPI legislation in the first place, we should be the last to avail of pay restoration, not among the first, if for no other reason than to give a lead in pay restoration restraint and to show an understanding of the pain which FEMPI inflicted on our society.  We must show true leadership.  Teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; have had their entry level pay reduced by 20% while their senior colleagues have had FEMPI applied to them in a draconian manner.  These and other groups are having to fight hard and protest to ensure partial restoration of their pay scales, yet they have no clear pathway to full restoration of pay.<\/p> <p> Many other workers and professions have suffered severely from the application of FEMPI legislation.  General practice has seen a severe and devastating application of FEMPI, not just to net income but to gross turnover.  Having a 38% reduction applied to gross fees has rendered many general practices unsustainable.  GPs have had to abandon their practices, emigrate, retire early or simply become insolvent.  As a profession, general practice has been so undermined by FEMPI that it is difficult to see how it can recover to begin to take on the responsibility and necessity to be the bedrock of our health service.  All evidence presented to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare advises that general practice-led primary care is the most apt and efficient place to provide care for chronic illness and to look after our ageing population in local communities, thus avoiding the trolley queues that are now a regular feature of our health service.  However, there is no pathway for pay restoration under FEMPI legislation for independent contractors, be they GPs, dentists, pharmacists or others who supply services to the Government.  Outlining a pathway for the unwinding of FEMPI for self-employed contractors should be a priority for the Government.  Therefore, this unwinding of FEMPI for Deputies and Senators should be deferred until all other sectors of society have had their pay restored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800051#ZZ02600","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478640300,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harty for observing the time.

Much has been made by speakers tonight about the independence of the process to determine Members' pay.  I support that process fully and we should stick with it.  There were many years when that was not the case and the change is an important and welcome development.  That does not mean Members cannot take decisions in their own right or as parties in respect of whether now is the right time for Deputies to accept restoration of pay.  I argue strongly that this is not the right time given the problems the country faces.  Many people remain in dire straits and many are working desperately to keep their heads above water.  There are 500,000 people on hospital waiting lists.  One in nine children lives in poverty and 2,000 children are homeless and living in emergency accommodation.  Many public sector workers are on pay that is so low, they qualify for family income supplement.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, this is not the right time for Deputies to restore their own pay or to accept such a restoration.  One of the biggest issues facing the country is the demand for wage increases, in particular in the public service.  Members of the House and members of Government, in particular, can have no moral authority in talking about the need for pay restraint if we are unprepared to practise it ourselves.  This is not the right time for Deputies to accept pay restoration.  We must lead by example if we are to have any credibility in this area at all.  On the question of independence, of course, Deputies' allowances were supposed to be addressed through an independent mechanism.  That was the recommendation in 2010, but the Government, regrettably, has not accepted it.<\/p>  <p>  The tone of some of the contributions tonight was regrettable.  It is in no one's interest for Members of the House to show disrespect to other Members and belittle the role of Deputies.  We work damn hard and should be respected for it, but that does not necessarily mean we must accept a recommendation to take pay restoration.  That tone was regrettable.  The Social Democrats have proposed an amendment to the motion.  We propose that instead of the Government deciding it, the D&aacute;il should.  It is not up to the Government.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I will not accept the restoration of pay on this occasion and will be gifting it to the State.  I urge other Members who are talking about not taking it to do likewise and not to use this sum of money as a personal slush fund to enhance their standing in their constituencies, however that is done.

There is no proposal in the motion which would allow Deputies to set their own salaries.  What is being requested is that Deputies voluntarily agree not to accept these huge increases.

The Government is supporting the rich and powerful in our society while low and middle income and poor families are being mugged daily.  There is a housing crisis and people are on hospital trolleys and waiting lists.  They are finding it almost impossible to make ends meet.  The 2016 budget gave &euro;120 million to the richest 5% in the country while the 2017 budget gives them another &euro;52 million.  At the same time, Social Justice Ireland has said the budget for 2017 disproportionately favours the wealthiest in our society.  Even after the budget and the &euro;5 per week increase, the basic social welfare rate is &euro;17 per week below the line at which a person is at risk of poverty.  Of our people, 750,000 live in poverty while one in every five children lives in a household which lives below the poverty line.  Some 20% of children are in poverty.  These are shocking statistics.  Those on the minimum wage get 10 cent and our pensioners get &euro;5.  It beggars belief that the political elite in the D&aacute;il should think they are worth an additional &euro;100 per week.

It does not stop there.  We receive an incredibly generous travel and accommodation allowance, which is unvouched and not independently set, of between &euro;9,000 and &euro;34,000, depending on one's distance from the D&aacute;il.  There are also excessively generous additional payments for Chairs of Oireachtas committees, Ministers of State, Ministers, An T&aacute;naiste and An Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of what that means in real terms.  My Fine Gael constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has a basic take-home pay of &euro;171,000 a year.  My Fianna F&aacute;il constituency colleague, Deputy John Curran, because he is the Chair of a committee, has a basic take-home pay of &euro;104,000 a year.  <\/p>  <p>  As if these excessive rates of pay were not sufficient, nobody has mentioned the incredibly generous pension scheme of which Deputies avail.  If I understand the scheme correctly, an average Deputy will get a pension contribution payment from the State of in the region of &euro;90,000 annually.  If they are lucky enough to do four terms in the House, that gives them an annual pension payment of &euro;46,000 and a pension pot of &euro;1.8 million. What do Deputies put into that pension contribution annually?  They put in &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody can say these levels of pay and pensions are not excessive.  In fact, at some level no one can say they are not obscene.  On a number of occasions in the past D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled legislation in the House to reform those payments substantially.  Other parties, including Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular, opposed them.  Instead, we have the spectacle today of Deputies effectively saying they deserve a pay rise.  I listened to Deputy Catherine Connolly very carefully.  While I respect her opinion, this is a serious issue.  At a time when people across the State are struggling to get by, the rates of pay of the people in the House is something we should debate.  We do not propose to break the Independents; this is simply about saying that a pay increase is not acceptable at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The idea that anybody in the House deserves, or indeed needs, an extra &euro;5,000 a year is not only wrong, but drives a wedge between the public and politicians.  That is the fault of politicians who are accepting this pay rise, not those of us who object to it.  Like my party colleagues, I do not take home a full Deputy's salary.  I invest the remainder in constituency services and my community, something for which I make no apology.  In this instance, given the timing of this pay rise, I will simply not accept it and will instead return it to the Exchequer.  The reason for this is simple.  Nobody in the House deserves or needs a pay rise.  If one believes and supports those very simple facts, then I urge every Deputy in the House to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800053#BBB00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1478640900,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Over the past number of days, we have seen the issue of pay to the forefront with teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.

I am also very conscious that many young people who are unemployed are receiving &euro;100 a week.  It is proposed that Deputies receive an increase of &euro;100 per week at a time when others only receive a total of &euro;100 a week.

Ex-taoisigh are to get an extra &euro;15,000 while there are those who are struggling to pay a mortgage.  An increase in the salaries of 158 Deputies will not make or break the world, but it sends out the wrong signal.  People throughout the country are living in tough conditions at the moment and Deputies have to ensure that the message is sent out to every constituency that we are not in it for the money.<\/p>  <p>  I question the whole system.  Deputies are like subbies.  We are here for two, three or, perhaps, five years.  If I were doing a job in the private sector, once I had it done, I would have to go and do the next one.  I question what we are entitled to when it comes to pensions, etc.  Can the country afford this type of system?  The deals negotiated by the unions need to be questioned.  We can compare those who earn &euro;20,000 to &euro;40,000 a year and the pay rises they are to get with the union bosses who are on &euro;140,000 or &euro;150,000 a year and who negotiated increases of &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 for those in the upper echelons of the Civil Service and Deputies.  This motion should not apply only to Deputies.  It should be extended to anyone in the public service who is earning more than &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 a year.  They should not be getting pay rises, because it is middle Ireland that has suffered and been crippled in the past years.<\/p>  <p>  It is good to hear in the past few minutes that the teachers' strike has been called off.  Common sense needed to prevail because children needed to return to school.  The upper echelons, be they ex-taoisigh or senior civil servants, are all in the mix and represented by their unions.  They need to take the bull by the horns, step back and say they are not entitled to the increase.  If legislation is required, it should be enacted.  Whatever money is saved should be given to middle Ireland.  It should be given to young nurses and teachers.  We do not have a pot of gold.  We cannot give out money on every side of us.  We need to ensure that those who are in most need get it.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to see an end to Deputies who have public service jobs such as teaching posts straddling both sides.  They should not preach that they are Deputies while they hold onto their public service job and someone else is sent in to substitute.  Give up the job.  Let that person have it.  Be brave enough to make that decision and show a way forward.  Do not try to keep two jobs going at the one time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800054#CCC00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1478641500,"counter":600,"content":"<p>No one in this Chamber this evening deserves a pay rise of any description.  Let us be clear about that.  While the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and some Ministers have stated that they will not take their respective increases, they have not stated the same in respect of the increase of more than &euro;5,000 for Deputies.  The increase should not be taken by any Deputy.  It is outrageous that those on the average wage in the public sector, earning &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 annually, are to get pay restoration of &euro;1,000 while Deputies are expecting to take more than &euro;100 a week.  We can then compare it with the unemployed young people in this State who are expected to live on a weekly payment of &euro;102.70, an increase of &euro;2.70 in this budget.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to clarify the details concerning the pay of Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies.  All Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies draw down the full salary and take the average industrial wage out of it.  The rest goes into constituency services.  We make no apology for using that money to provide a first class service for our constituents throughout the State.  Our job is to serve them and we make no apologies for it.  It is also worth noting that this money is also used to employ additional staff in our offices, which saves the State money by taking them off the live register.  Any change in our pay situation is a matter for Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies.  It will not pose any additional cost to the State. <\/p>  <p>  Tonight's motion is about whether Deputies should get an increase in salary, which will be an additional cost to the State at a time of significant industrial unrest in the public sector.  The Government just about managed to avoid an all out strike of the garda&iacute; last week.  This evening, the ASTI has called off its industrial action, but that issue is not yet resolved.  It needs to be resolved and the Government's sole focus should be on it.  It is time for all Deputies to show real leadership and to forgo this pay increase.  I call on Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Independent Deputies to support this Sinn F&eacute;in motion and to oppose the gravy train and the additional &euro;5,400 on top of what is an already huge salary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800054#CCC00300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1478641500,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I sincerely hope that those Deputies who will not support our motion will put their hand in their pockets and use their &euro;100 a week to buy a bit of brasso for their brass necks.  This is exactly what people will think when watching us this evening.  They will see people who earn &euro;87,000 a year and who lecture pensioners and tell them to be grateful for a fiver accept a &euro;100 a week pay increase.<\/p><p>I was sent to the D&aacute;il not to make a large amount of money but to stand up for people.  I did not come here to take or support a weekly pay increase of &euro;100 for myself but to speak for those the Minister believes should be grateful for a fiver a week.<br\/><br\/>The Government has stated repeatedly that Deputies, Senators, Ministers, public servants and everybody else had their pay cut and that the proposed increase in Deputies' pay is in line with the Lansdowne Road agreement.  According to the Government, teachers at the bottom of the payscale who are worried about how they will pay their rent should be grateful for the protection afforded by the agreement.  The Lansdowne Road agreement is crashing down around the Minister's feet.  Unlike most of the Deputies present, Deputy Funchion and I have taken cases to the Labour Court on behalf of low-income workers who had justified pay claims.  We were repeatedly told by the people seated on the other side who represented the Government that these claims could not be processed during the lifetime of the Lansdowne Road agreement because they would have a cost-increasing effect.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have exploded that myth.<br\/><br\/>As the president of SIPTU, Jack O'Connor, stated on a radio programme this morning and as plenty of others have pointed out, the Lansdowne Road agreement is over.  Those who are left clinging tightly to the agreement are the people who are set to receive a pay increase of &euro;100 per week.  Everybody else in the public service is watching the D&aacute;il.  People know Deputies are well paid.  No one disputes that we work hard but none of us works harder than a nurse working a shift in an accident and emergency department tonight or a teacher who came off the picket line today and will face his or her pupils tomorrow.  If they are following this debate, I do not believe they will say that Deputies are worth this pay increase.<br\/><br\/>I am old enough to remember a time when the Labour Party had socialist members.  By God, that party has changed.  To be lectured by a Teachta D&aacute;la from the Labour Party who wags his finger and tells the House in no uncertain terms that he has no compunction about taking this pay increase because he is worth it is nothing short of disgraceful. <br\/><br\/>I will address the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who expressed <i>faux<\/i>outrage about a potential loss of independence.  I hope Deputy Calleary misunderstood the argument we have been making as I would like him to find it in his conscience to support the motion.  Not one person on this side has suggested Deputies give up their independence.  Sinn F&eacute;in is perfectly prepared to maintain the independent setting of Deputies' wages, but that does not mean we should take this pay increase.<br\/><br\/>Everyone speaks about being fair to low and middle-income workers.  Fianna F&aacute;il repeatedly says we should be fair to these workers out of one side of its mouth, while from the other side of its mouth, it says it will start being fair to low and middle-income workers by taking a &euro;5,000 pay increase.  Deputies on a salary of &euro;87,000 will lead by example by taking a &euro;5,000 pay increase, while shedding crocodile tears for people in the public service who tonight are worrying about how they will pay their rent and feed their children.  I urge Deputies to lead by example and do the right thing by supporting the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800054#CCC00400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478642100,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1478642100,"counter":604,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 10 November 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800055#DDD00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478642100,"counter":605,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.45 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 9 November 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
