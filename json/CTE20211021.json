After lunch, the committee will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.

As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action or anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they do so.<\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

Its primary responsibility is to safeguard and improve the welfare of children.  Prior to 2014, most of the agency's functions were undertaken by the HSE.  Staff, assets and systems were transferred from the HSE to Tusla on its establishment, but the agency still relies on the HSE for support with certain functions, including procurement and ICT systems.<br\/><br\/>The agency's financial statements for 2020 record total income of around &euro;870 million, almost all of which comes from the Vote for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This includes &euro;17 million provided to support the agency's capital investment.  The agency's expenditure in 2020 was &euro;858 million.  Around one-third of the expenditure related to staff costs.  The agency employed around 4,600 whole-time equivalent staff at the end of 2020.<br\/><br\/>Most of the remaining expenditure in 2020 comprised direct payments or grant funding for the provision of services to support children and families.  This included &euro;119 million spent on foster care and aftercare allowances; &euro;142 million spent on independent placement provision, including residential care; and &euro;182 million paid as grants to organisations delivering a wide range of child and family services.  The agency incurred expenditure amounting to around &euro;30 million on guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>costs and legal fees.  The agency's office and administration expenses were &euro;36 million.<br\/><br\/>I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2020, which I certified on 30 June 2021.  However, I drew attention to two matters disclosed by the agency in its statement on internal control.  First, the agency acknowledges that in excess of &euro;6 million was spent on goods and services where the relevant public procurement rules were not complied with.  Second, as members are aware, the HSE suffered a ransomware cyberattack on its ICT systems in May 2021 resulting in the shutdown of all its ICT systems, including those supporting Tusla's operations.  In the statement on internal control, the agency outlines its plans to migrate its ICT systems away from the HSE network, except in respect of the HSE's integrated financial management system, IFMS, that is under development.  While the disruption to the agency's operations was significant, it happened after the period of account and does not impact the financial statements for 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Gloster to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#A00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear before them today.  I am joined as supporting witnesses by my colleagues, Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, and Ms. Kate Duggan, national director of services and integration and deputy CEO.  I have, as requested, provided the members with a short briefing document as an appendix to my opening statement and so I will confine my remarks here to some key themes.<\/p> <p>  The agency received referrals to its child protection and welfare service in 2020 at just below 70,000.  It is important to note that in the early stages of the Covid-19 response, we saw a concerning decrease.  I am satisfied this concern was proactively addressed and referral rates recovered.  Those children of specific levels of concern requiring a continuing social work service for a period were either at home - just over 15,000 - or in State care - 5,882 - at December 2020.<\/p> <p>  Not all referrals to the agency involve an abuse concern and many are welfare-based.  Some 22,300 of these children received a family support service in 2020 while 2,943 young adults received an aftercare service, including additional supports to reflect the context of the pandemic.  This is an area for further development.<\/p> <p>  The agency focused almost exclusively throughout the first months of the pandemic in ensuring the provision of domestic and sexual violence response services, child protection services and children in care supports.  In our specialist services separate to those above, 2020 saw key activity and statutory duties fulfilled in several ways.  Members will be aware of the repeated commentary on the ability of the agency to recruit staff and fill approved posts over recent years.  Tusla had developed an increasing dependence on temporary agency staffing.  A programme to convert these to Tusla employment took place in 2020 resulting in a reduction to a more appropriate level and a decrease in spend on agency staffing of &euro;19.5 million, which is continuing thus far to a saving of approximately &euro;4 million annually.  This has been maintained in 2021.  Our focus then shifted to improved graduate recruitment.<\/p> <p>  I also again note that concern for staff safety and welfare remains a priority in the context of understanding the staffing of the agency.  Within the workforce, social work recruitment and retention remains a serious challenge.  Generating supply is one area of activity.  The agency participates in the Department-led social work education group and, separately, the chair of the agency and I have engaged with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on this issue.  Increased supply and retention efforts alone will not deal with this issue, and there is a critical need to examine the utilisation of multidisciplinary teams for child protection and welfare work.  That noted, Tusla at the end of 2020 was effectively at full employment of its funded workforce, representing a substantial improvement on previous years.<\/p> <p>  Tusla is subject to regulatory oversight from several sources, including HIQA, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Health and Safety Authority, the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Information Commissioner and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Progress is being made in respect of the various functions that lead to more improved compliance, but there can be no doubting that challenges remain.  In respect of care and protection services, we have seen significant improvements in many HIQA reports while also remaining clear that some individual services or parts of them are found to be non-compliant, and this is concerning.<\/p> <p>  The agency concluded the year 2020 in a stable position financially through one-off adjustment and relative to the projected deficits cumulating from activity of previous years.  The target of the agency was to achieve a stable position coming into 2021, and thanks to the intervention of the Minister and the Department, this was achieved.  I am concerned regarding the long-term challenges for some of our funded organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  Efforts are continuing to mitigate those challenges to the greatest extent possible.  These organisations, many of them service providers, are critical to the effectiveness of the agency.  We did make some progress in 2020 and 2021 for this sector on a once-off basis.  However, the long-term solution to the challenge is beyond the scope of Tusla.<\/p> <p>  Eighteen out of the past 24 months during which I have been CEO of the agency have been characterised by two major events: Covid-19, and the cyberattack on HSE systems in May of this year.  The impact of both is still evident and well documented.  I am pleased to report to this committee that, notwithstanding these major disruptions, the board and the executive of the agency have remained focused on two key activities.  The first is the continuity of critical services to children and families throughout those events.  Tusla, as the State child protection agency, was identified by Government at the start of the pandemic and in the cyberattack as one of the key essential front-line services to be maintained.  Our response capability to each crisis was of a very high standard.<\/p> <p>  The second is the continuity of major changes and reforms within the agency.  These are in response to fundamental challenges.  On commencing my role, I agreed with the board that these were our priority and remain so.  I am pleased to report significant progress in key areas of change in the organisation.  At the end of this month, Tusla will have completed a major part of the reform of governance of the agency through the recruitment of a revised executive management team and six new defined regions, each with its own chief officer.  Through empowering local regions, we will see an even greater focus on need, better integration and improved performance management with appropriate accountability.<\/p><p>The board and I recognise that many challenges and issues remain to be addressed.  Be they in the context of history or current-day service provision, it is fair to say we have challenges.  I have no doubt some of those will be reported and commented on in the future.  Equally, there is substantial evidence to show we have made, and continue to make, progress on many fronts, with excellent work being done by some 5,000 staff every day.  Consistency and continuous improvement are central for the coming years.<\/p><p> I thank the Chair and am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gloster.

We have put in place a major contract around private residential services, which is around &euro;90 million per annum, that was completed across 2020 and 2021.  We have a major procurement under way around private foster care, which is due to be completed before the end of the year.

We have approximately 300 locations across the country in Tusla.  Cleaning, security, office supplies, etc., fall to those local areas.

Different circumstances will dictate the aftercare arrangements, but the rates for foster care arrangements for children up to the age of 18 are the same nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gloster and the other witnesses for joining us today.

I am not sure if Mr. Gloster is familiar with the Montague report, entitled Ballymun - A Brighter Future, which Dublin City Council published.

It pointed out that north Dublin city, which of course includes Cabra, Finglas and other areas, has the highest number of children in care in the country.

Our area manager in Dublin north city, Joy McGlynn, has been part of the inter-agency approach to that report in terms of its findings and recommendations.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, Dublin north city is one of the areas where we are significantly challenged in the profile of children and families who require our support and the profile of children and young people who touch off our system in terms of either family support or the care system.  The Deputy has also pointed out that Dublin north city has the highest number of children in care.  It also has the highest number of community and voluntary services within that region.  One of the areas we look at and focus on in Dublin north city is how to work much more collaboratively and work in partnership with our community and voluntary partners to respond to the need that is there.<\/p> <p>  Dublin north city, like the rest of the country, is challenged in terms of our ability to allocate an adequate number of social workers.<\/p><p>At the moment, the agency has a headcount of approximately 1,770 social workers.  However, we have a number of vacancies and that is compounded by the approximately 70 staff who are on maternity leave and, in the context of Covid-19, for health and safety reasons,k those staff are often working away from the front line from the beginning of their pregnancy.  Therefore, we are challenged our allocation of social workers across the country.<\/p><p> We are taking a number of actions.  We have already spoken about the agency conversion programme that has happened.  We are facilitating a number of student placements and our CEO is engaging with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in looking to increase the number of student placements.  We offered a permanent contract to every new graduate who was qualifying from the universities this year.  So far, out of 184 places in the universities, 130 individuals have expressed an interest in coming to work for Tusla.  After qualification and interview, that has translated into securing 99 additional social workers for the whole of the country, whereas 89 social workers left the agency between January and July this year.  Therefore, we are significantly challenged in our ability to allocate social workers.  In 2021, out of additional Government funding of approximately &euro;7 million, we allocated 65 new social work posts across the country, but the challenge remains.  The solution is around working with partner agencies and diversifying our workforce.  The Deputy talked about drugs and substance abuse issues and issues such as domestic violence in Dublin north city, and we are looking to diversify our workforce to meet that response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Ms Duggan has touched on two of the points in the report.  I am delighted to hear Tusla is more than familiar with the report and is participating in the inter-agency response.  I know it is something the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office is also involved in.  Regarding the two issues she touched on, recruitment is one element but retention is another.  In Dublin north city, 4% of cases are allocated within the 40 days whereas the national average for Tusla is 22%.  There is something else going on in Dublin north city and it is obviously to do with the difficulty of the work for many social workers and the retention issue.  The report points out that the appointment of more senior social workers would be one way of responding to that, giving people more responsibility, obviously, but also perhaps keeping them in post for longer.  I wonder if that is something Tusla has had an opportunity to consider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>That is a very fair observation.  There are myriad reasons it is difficult to retain staff.  We have invested a lot of energy this year in understanding fully the people who leave us with less than two years&rsquo; service and the people who leave with less than five years&rsquo; service, because it is in that band of years that the retention problem is.  People who leave after five years tend to leave for probably more understandable reasons.<\/p> <p>  I would point to a couple of factors.  First, pre-Covid, in Dublin city, in particular, it was difficult to attract social workers to come and stay.  There are some very good social workers in Dublin and we are delighted they are with us.  However, it is difficult to attract new social workers to come and stay given the cost of living and many different reasons, so that was one factor.<\/p> <p>  The other factor is there has been an increase among social work employers across the country in their demand for social workers.  This year, 184 people came off the courses in Ireland and 144 of them had registered with CORU by September, which means 40 are probably thinking about travel or something like that and 144 are available.  I could use every one of those and I did offer a job to every one of those who wanted a job.  However, my colleagues in the health service are recruiting social workers, the Probation Service recruits social workers, the section 38 agencies across the disability sector recruit social workers, and so on.  Social work has now become part of the multidisciplinary team in every health and social care context and that is a challenge for us.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that statutory child protection is considered to be one of the most hard-end areas of work to do.  While that is not to undervalue the work of anybody else, it is considered to be one of the hardest areas of social work to do.  I have said many times, including in my opening statement, that I think we have to move to a new model of multidisciplinary teams because there are lots of other disciplines and professions that could contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

I do not expect the witnesses to give me a commitment today but it might be something they consider and I will come back to them on this.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of diversifying, I would make two comments.  Youth workers, in particular those involved in school completion programmes, the family support agencies and family support centres, are a huge asset and should form part of that.  I was at an amazing event yesterday for Valerie O&rsquo;Carroll, the manager of the Ballymun Family Resource Centre who retired yesterday, a woman with a tireless commitment to Ballymun and a tireless commitment to social justice.  We hope her replacement will be just as good.  Having those people on the ground supports the social workers who are in place.  Sometimes, people in the school completion programmes and the family support centres feel like the Cinderella of Tusla and they do not feel they get the priority and resources they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that this year, for the first year in many, the school completion programmes got an increase.

That is why I said I am concerned about the sustainability of some of the services.  I have been out to Ballymun and Finglas and to some of the after-school clubs, and I know the Minister has been out there as well.

Is that a signalling of a policy shift?  What is the real-time position in respect of that?

In that interview, as in many others, I pointed to the fact that social care services in Ireland - in private nursing homes for the elderly, in the disability sector and in other areas - all have private provision.  There are some very good providers so I do not want to make this about disparaging any type of provision.  The point I was making in that article is very simply this: more than 60% of children in residential care are now dependent on private provision and that is far too significant a dependency for a sector that is populated by companies and organisations that can exit the market any time they choose to do so, or where other circumstances arise.  It is the level of dependency rather than the existence of the dependency.<\/p><p>The policy direction in Tusla is to come up with a plan, by the end of this year, to redress that balance and create more public provision.  That will take several years to achieve.  There is no doubt that we have reached the lowest number we will have in terms of children in residential care.  That number will probably increase slightly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions following on from that.  As I understand it, there is an entity called Positive Care, which is on Tusla's list of private providers.  A cursory look at the information for this organisation shows that it runs 13 or 14 houses.  Based on the ratios of staff to children, I conclude that there could be anything between 30 and 60 children being cared for across those services.  What does the future look like for an entity like Positive Care and why does such an organisation exist in the first instance?  It seems obvious that Tusla is not able to meet the provision it is required to deliver.  I am not trying to use loaded language here but such entities would not exist if Tusla, objectively speaking, were doing its job and making provision for those places within its own system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#F00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>If we were starting from a greenfield site in 2014, prior to my time, that would be the case and the Deputy's observation would be closer to being accurate.  However, we have to look at the context from which residential care provision came.  The extent of the growth of private provision is partly because the public sector, during more scarce times, did not invest in keeping public capacity at the level that was needed.  That is the first aspect.  The second point is that there has always been provision outside of the direct State provision.  There has been voluntary sector provision by NGOs, many of which had their origins in the religious orders that provided residential care in the past.  A large number of those organisations are no longer operating.  There are still some NGOs providing a service but part of that need was filled by the private sector.  When a State agency like Tusla is considering spending money on a service that it is not going to provide itself, EU procurement rules and all sorts of other rules, as we discussed, dictate that private providers are eligible to apply for that work.  There is a history and context to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that and I appreciate Mr. Gloster's response.

Approximately half, if not slightly more, of the total legal spend in the agency goes on guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>services and associated legal costs.  It is a very significant cost in any one year and we do not have control over it.  We have some control over the fees, and the agency made an effort to bring some balance in that regard a few years ago.  There was a lot of activity on the legislation prior to the Covid crisis and in the previous D&aacute;il.  The pandemic has impacted that, as has the legislative programme of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

In addition to that, the nature and type of crisis and work that arises in the course of an agency like Tusla added to the very significant events leading to the 2018 HIQA report, the Charleton tribunal and so on.  The agency became very centralised, very heavily dependent on the centre, to the point where there was no significant level of local autonomy and local authority, and all that goes with that.  The reform of the structure I pointed to is about correcting that imbalance.  That is just one part of many changes.

Yes, we have engagement with the universities at a number of levels.  Our chief social worker and his team are engaged with them at a developmental level.  The Department has a social work education group, which has the education sector on it also, and we are on that.  As I said in my opening statement, I have had engagement along with my chair with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  So they are all of the pieces to try and move it on.  To come to the core of the question, there were 184 graduates available from eight courses in Ireland this year and so far we are looking at a position where 144 registered with CORU.  That is what is available to Ireland and that is certainly the amount of available positions.  The need beyond Tusla exceeds that.<\/p> <p>  We did take some steps in recent years to try out different initiatives.  We did do a one-round scholarship programme with Maynooth University, which started a course.  We certainly got a reasonable yield out of that.  They are now continuing as a provider themselves.  We would look to sponsorship across the university sector in the future but it is something that we would have to get into more detailed planning about in terms of the cost and the return for it.<\/p> <p>  Again the chief social worker, who has a significant developmental role in social work practice in the agency, and his team, have put huge work into the provision of placements.  We have a high number of placement supervisors across our social work workforce.  We take a significant number of students.  Usually, half the students in training will come to Tusla for a placement either in the first or second year of their masters programme and then they go to other providers in disability services, mental health services and so on.  We, therefore, have very good placement capacity.  I have indicated to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that we could absorb another 50 placements if the colleges had those places in place to expand the supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>In terms of the colleges, a number has been mentioned.

It is those types of initiatives for the future rather than just expecting the traditional courses to expand because there is demand in universities for expansion of lots of different programmes from social work to nursing and right across the spectrum of health and social services.

Without additional funding coming in, it did not look as though there was any prospect of new services being provided where there have been demographic shifts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#S00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I suspect the changes and variation across the country is in part due to some of the youth organisations that receive funding from Tusla participating in specific Tusla programmes.

It is a Department-led construct and the two would need to be put together to get the full picture.  I am certainly happy to come back to the Deputy with further detail.  As to the Deputy's point, no more than what I said earlier about people who could become very effective in the child protection, child welfare and family support systems in multidisciplinary teams, I include the youth sector in that.

I was not assured that we could satisfy ourselves by just responding to the Kerry incident, so we did a national self-assessment audit with our 17 area managers.  We arrived at a position where the best estimate we had was approximately 12% to 13% of what legitimately should be notified to the Garda as suspected abuse was not being or had not been notified on time.  We have put in place significant correction and audit measures to check that is now more effective.

The first is the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  Related to that is the Broadcasting Fund, which is a separate account but is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and again there is a clear audit opinion for that fund.<\/p> <p>  No. 4 is TG4 for 2020.  I draw attention to a case of significant non-compliant procurement in that case.  This related to an ICT contract to develop a system for use by TG4 but it was not competitively procured. <\/p> <p>  No. 5 is the Social Insurance Fund and it is quite a significant account.  I can see that there is a typo there.  The turnover of the fund should be &euro;14.8 billion not &euro;14.8 million.  There is a clear audit opinion on this but I draw attention to two chapters from the report and the accounts of the public services.  Chapter 9 deals with regularity of payments and chapter 11 takes a deeper look at the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, the bulk of which was charged to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 6 and 7 are related.  These are the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal special account and the Hepatitis C and HIV compensation reparation fund.

CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE&rsquo;s industry members welcome the placing of the circular economy strategy on a statutory footing through the circular economy Bill and the evolution of the environment fund into a circular economy fund.<br\/><br\/>The Government&rsquo;s ambition to transition to a circular economy and become a leader in Europe by 2050 is matched by the willingness of industry to engage in this transformation journey.  This is illustrated by CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE&rsquo;s network of cross-sectoral manufacturing companies and what we refer to as &quot;second life enablers&quot;.  These are microenterprise SMEs and multinationals alike ranging throughout the country.  They include Novelplast and Gannon Eco in Meath, Automatic Plastics in Wicklow, Farrell Furniture in Louth; pharmaceutical companies like Hovione; ICT asset management companies; household names like Kerry Food and Coca-Cola Ireland; and extended producer responsibility schemes such as WEEE Ireland, the European Recycling Platform and Repak, which represent thousands of Irish businesses <br\/><br\/>All our members have committed to understanding what the circular economy means for their business and how to overcome key barriers to implementation to deliver significant reductions in both CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions and waste over the lifespan of this pilot initiative, which currently runs until the end of 2022.  The diversity of our network highlights that no company can transition to the circular economy on its own.  Embedding circularity in the Irish economy demands a collective effort by Irish society, industry, policymakers, academia, the third sector and citizens alike.<br\/><br\/>As the secretariat of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE, Irish Manufacturing Research, an Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland supported technology centre, commends the cross-departmental dialogues in recent years among the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise, Trade and Employment<b>, <\/b>which have laid the foundation for placing climate action, circular economy and the bioeconomy at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development model.  We also commend the Government on driving forward with a green recovery, with circular economy at its heart as we navigate the road out of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This positive momentum is illustrated by the centrality of circular economy in the national climate action plan, the waste action plan for a circular economy in 2020, the all-of-government circular economy strategy with a commitment to develop key sectoral roadmaps, and the circular economy Bill that we are here to discuss.<br\/><br\/>It is notable that the circular economy is explicitly referenced 39 times in the recently published National Development Plan 2021-2030 and that &euro;98 million was allocated to the 2022 budget of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to support this transition.  It is an exciting time in circular economy development in Ireland and the CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE network is a positive example of moving circular economy ideation into reality.  For example, we have supported founding members' internal capacity building on their journey from linear to circular business models, through knowledge sharing between our networks and a range of actors throughout the innovation ecosystem, from regional development to academia and third sector, through our annual thematic working groups, which have ranged from topics on circular bioeconomy to circular procurement to circular packaging and by de-risking circular economy models through supporting ideation and proposal development for multipartner innovation pilots funded through our fund.<\/p><p>Some examples we have funded to date are the circular economy skill set initiative, which is an industry-accredited and standards-based repair training programme led by WEEE Ireland in collaboration with IBEC&rsquo;s White Goods Association and Fast-track into IT, FIT.  We have also funded the #CEPowerofMany demonstrator that aims to create a closed-loop system in the construction sector led by Freefoam Plastics in collaboration with Mulligan Guttering, Glenveagh Homes and Shabra Recycling.  There are others.  Another key area of our work is piloting the first late-stage accelerator dedicated to supporting circular economy ventures to scale in collaboration with Tangent and a recent alumni The ZeroNet, which won the UK's top Circular Economy Project of the Year award in 2021.<\/p><p> CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE&rsquo;s members all agree that circular economy needs to be embraced and are committed to implementation, but there is a significant degree of complexity in implementing circularity at scale.  This is relates to the vast regulatory landscape; redesigning products and business models without clear marketplaces existing; the need to establish enabling infrastructure both physical and digital; the requirement for internal capacity building to support the culture change and mindset change required to embrace this new model; and the need to expand capabilities and recruitment of new skills.  The circular economy does not just sit with compliance and waste management; it is across the entire organisation and value chain.  All of these activities require substantial upfront investment with medium- to longer-term returns.<\/p><p> Our members are committed to getting things done but equally fearful in the absence of clarity of what the regulatory environment will look like and what markets will exist in Ireland for circular product-service systems.  One member brought this to life by describing the importance of &ldquo;de-risking the initial toe-in-the water pilots&rdquo;, stating further &ldquo;... even if there is an opportunity related to circular economy in the absence of a defined market - particularly for SMEs - any investment is fundamentally a gamble...&rdquo;.  Our members are part of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE because it gives them confidence that they are heading in the right direction and this initiative is viewed as enabling and supporting the derisking of this transformation.  In this context, CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE&rsquo;s members welcome a more hands-on regulatory approach, with flexibility for research and development and greater regulatory certainty via clearer regulatory frameworks, citing the success of extended producer responsibility, EPR, schemes for WEEE Ireland as replicable for other sectors.  Members also welcome supports to create marketplaces, the embedding of circularity criteria into existing public funding calls and developing specific capital expenditure funds, and more dialogue between public bodies, third sector organisations, industry, and citizens.<\/p><p> Finally, in this context, it is worth highlighting comparative investment by other EU nation states, for example ZeroWaste Scotland, which has created a &pound;18 million grant fund for SMEs.  The Netherlands, which is regarded a leader in the EU for circularity, announced at our launch last year that it was committing &euro;20 million for knowledge and capacity-building initiatives.<\/p><p> To conclude, circular economy is a key tool in the broader climate action, bio-economy and just transition agendas.  Scaling up implementation of circularity in Ireland represents a significant economic opportunity, estimated at &euro;2 billion annually.  Capitalising on this requires closing the circular economy knowledge, capacity building and implementation gaps.  We have started this journey with manufacturers and their supply chains with the objective of demystifying, derisking, and role modelling implementation of circular models, but there is much more work to be done.  Our members have expressed the need for regulatory certainty for industry, sectoral roadmaps with clear targets and time lines, as well as a supportive enabling environment with training, guidance and funding supports that can leverage Ireland's ambition to engage in the circular economy and translate this into sustainable industrial action in Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank the committee again for the opportunity to provide evidence of what a public-private partnership pilot can deliver in capacity building and innovation demonstrations towards implementing a more circular economy in Ireland and I look forward to addressing the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan for her statement.

At the end of 2019 we started off with 20 companies.  Then Covid hit.  We had a big ambition to grow the network and double it every year.  In answer to the Chairman's question on corporate engagement, the awareness about the circular economy is ever-growing in an Irish context.  Irish manufacturing went about the stakeholder engagement process in 2019 to understand the need for a network such as CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE because in some of our sustainability dialogues in 2018, Irish Manufacturing Research, IMR, members were asking \"What is this circular economy and what does it mean for our business?\"  In a roundabout way I am trying to articulate that with corporate engagement we now have 37 members.  They are a range of actors because a circular economy is not something that can be addressed just by manufacturers; they need to work in collaboration with their supply chains.  Yes, there is corporate engagement.  The chairman mentioned J&amp;J Vision Care, which is in the medical-tech environment.  We also have DePuy Synthes and we have actors from different sectors in the manufacturing and broader supply chains.  The nature of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE is varied.  That said, I can give examples of other entities such as Kingspan and Cisco which are not part of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE because they have already embraced this agenda and have said, \"We understand what you are seeking to do and we can definitely feed insights into your members but we do not need you because we are already doing it.\"  We have a mixed bag of actors at different levels of maturity with regard to their journey towards a circular business model and what role they will play.  Many companies are starting to realise that they can get disrupted if they do not understand what this means for their business.  All sites will engage with the Government signals and the momentum of the EU, especially from multinationals because this is not unique to Ireland it is a European issue.  I am very positive about engagement, and around trying to grapple with what this means for business in the next five, ten, 15 or 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>With respect to the scheme before us, is Dr. Brennan seeing enough in there that will drive industry and manufacturing in that direction, or is that more for the action plan as opposed to the framework legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#B00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Will the Chairman clarify if by \"scheme\" he means the plan ahead and the Bill that is coming?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#B00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>We are working with some of those who are first movers.  There are trying to get their heads around it at the moment.  We have only been operational for 18 months and as an initiative we are still quite young.  While this is driving momentum, we have also been having conversations such as network coffee meetings, thematic working groups, quarterly network meetings, conversations, dialogue, awareness and training, and webinar hosting, which is all raising awareness and fostering that internal dialogue for key champions initially, and then further into the business.  The reason our members welcome the circular economy strategy and the Bill is they need regulatory certainty to fundamentally commit to the investment required.  As I highlighted in my opening statement the quote from the member who said that &ldquo;the initial toe-in-the water pilots&rdquo; are challenging, even if they understand that in the medium to long term there is going to be benefits around resilience, resource price volatility, and better customer engagement because of the nature of the relationship changing from a single transaction to repeat business.  They are not unaware that a circular economy will bring value to them in the future, but right now without a clearer literary framework there is a lot of risk.  Things can also fail and go wrong.  What we hear from them is that the CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE fund, the economy innovation grant scheme and the EPA's green enterprise scheme, which is directed towards a circular economy, all help them to test and pilot models and learn from that process, and it gives them the confidence to go and roll it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#B00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan for her presentation and welcome what she is doing.  In particular, I welcome her emphasis on the fact that the circular economy is not an offshoot or sideshoot of the waste debate.  That is an important point and I would be interested to hear just how central she believes that should be.  The circular economy embraces issues such as climate change and biodiversity, as well as end-of-life and other issues.  It should be the central spine of a lot of our attempts to make our approaches more sustainable.  In that context, what does she mean by \"regulatory certainty\"?  Some people feel that, as regards regulating materials, repairability and end-of-life obligations, we do not know the regulatory impact yet.  How can regulatory certainty be provided in a relatively underdeveloped world, particularly when getting into individual sectors?  A lot of work has been done around food but maybe not in other sectors.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Brennan believe the Bill should go beyond just stating that we need a strategy for the circular economy?  Should it put some sort of obligation on sectors to assess design principles and packaging principles and oblige the public sector to adopt and apply public procurement principles, or at this stage, as the Bill is now drafted, should it be left in general terms to evolve over time?  I would also be interested in her comments on the issue of targets.  The Bill makes provision for the introduction of reduce and repair targets.  Does her organisation have views on what shape such targets should take?  In respect of the use of a fund under this legislation, does she think the best way to proceed is by way of competitive calls and letting the best idea win, or should more structured grant schemes, sports schemes and so on be considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#C00100","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>There are quite a few questions there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#C00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I will start at the beginning and work my way through.  With regard to my positioning in the opening statement around the fact that the circular economy is a key tool in climate action, bioeconomy and the just transition, I need to be very mindful, while I am here, that I wear two hats.  I have come here and given an opening statement on behalf of the industry members of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE but as the head of circular economy in IMR, I also have my own perspective.  For clarity, I will try to indicate which perspective I am giving.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the broader umbrella of sustainability and seeking to achieve climate action, circularity, biodiversity, bioeconomy and just transition, from my perspective as someone who has worked in this field, I see them as being interconnected.  However, when it comes to measurement, verification and reporting, there is the potential that if we try to make the circular economy do too much - meaning address biodiversity - we could make it difficult.  The circular economy is hard to measure by just looking at resources and using carbon as another indicator to rectify its impacts.  That said, I am not saying that we do not need to take care of biodiversity when it comes to looking at the bioeconomy.  This is tricky stuff when it comes to setting targets and trying to make sure that this is operationable.  If I put my industry member hat on, most organisations recognise that the circular economy is a piece of this climate action agenda, not a replacement for it.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, with regard to the Deputy's comment on making the circular economy a central spine, that is in the action plan.  I agree that fundamental parts of this agenda are very important.  In terms of regulatory certainty, I take his point that it is an ask of the industry in an area that it and policymakers are learning about and there is a lot of work still to do.<\/p> <p>  On whether the Bill should go beyond the need for a strategy and try to incorporate obligations for sectors and design principles, given the complexity, that may be very challenging to do.  In light of trying to take the first step to keep evolving, in my personal capacity I would see including the strategy, with industry, citizens and public bodies learning as we go, as a more pragmatic approach.  Following up on the Department's contributions at earlier committee meetings, we do not have a material flow analysis of the economy.  We do not have all the baseline information and that means that setting targets that we are clear we are going to meet is challenging.<\/p> <p>  With regard to targets for reuse and repair, I would add the concept of remanufacturing, in light of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's emphasis on manufacturers.  While we have a small manufacturing base in Ireland and we import many products, there is an opportunity to effectively set up repair and remanufacturing.  The distinction between repair and remanufacturing is that from a consumer perspective, remanufactured products are guaranteed as new with a warranty as a new product.  There is a role for both repair warranties and remanufacturing warranties.  Understanding what is possible based on the make-up of products are manufactured in Ireland versus those that are imported and the infrastructure set up to keep them in use in the economy is part of that conversation.  That also involves looking at different sectors with those sectors and other actors to understand how we can set up ecosystems that include social enterprise and industry accredited repairers, remanufacturers and so on.<\/p> <p>  As to funding under this legislation and competitive calls or a structured grant scheme, ultimately it is about looking at the different needs of the sectors.  I would not have the answer outright and I would not want to speak on behalf of my sector with regard to this.  However, we have found through CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE that there is a need for SMEs, and sometimes even multinationals, to get support to understand how to write a grant funding application.  That is what IMR does for our bread and butter but we normally bring industry partners in.  The point of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's innovation fund is that we want industries to have skin in the game.  We want this to be fundamental to their corporate strategy in order for them to lead this demonstration.  I refer to industry members such as WEEE Ireland, the White Goods Association and FIT.  WEEE Ireland and IBEC are leading that demonstration in the context of the circular economy power of many in the construction sector.  The roofline manufacturer, Freefoam Plastics, is leading that demonstration and taking its entire supply chain with it.  The support needed to do that versus be an industry partner in some sort of demonstration are very different in terms of the internal capacities and capabilities.  The other piece is the need for regional demonstrators to understand and share learnings.  One of the outcomes of the OECD's policy dialogue with the Department and other stakeholders over the past number of months was basically that while the circular economy is being implemented in Ireland, it is fragmented so it is difficult for insights to be shared among all these different projects and activities.  If there is a way to put structure in to create regional activities, that would add value to the process.  I hope I have addressed those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Bruton happy with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#C00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I am very happy with that reply.  The one thing I would press Dr. Brennan on is that if we do not start to institute some requirement on sectors to look at design principles or packaging principles or whatever, even if it is only on the very loose basis of comply or explain, that it is not a stringent regulatory obligation.  CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE has 25 members out of God knows how many enterprises in the country that presumably have not come up to the starting line on this.  If we do not put something like that into the legislation how will the momentum be built to do the material flow analysis in order to do the exploration of the potential of different sectors and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#C00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point.<\/p><p>With regard to those targets, it is again a matter of how they are framed.  To go back to my opening statement, the industry members want a dialogue.  As the Deputy says, it is a matter of complying or explaining but they want an environment where they are also supported to address those targets.  I take the Deputy's point but it is fair to say that, with regard to driving momentum, targets that focus the mind can always help.  Someone referred to the European Union's policy in an IBEC webinar with industry recently and said that a regulatory tsunami was coming down the tracks for industry.  A lot of industry actors do not have regulatory departments.  They do not have people to unpack the policies.  With regard to engagement in the circular economy strategy, engaging with CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE would have been the first time some of our members had engaged in a policy dialogue.  Whichever way those carrots and sticks are used, there needs to be a supportive environment to incentivise and maintain that momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan for her engagement this morning.

This is a new concept and many people are finding their way for the first time.<\/p> <p>  In the conclusion of her opening statement, Dr. Brennan mentioned closing the knowledge gap as regards the circular economy for the public and for businesses.

To what extent are manufacturers and businesses willing to engage in it?  Are many businesses still a bit wary and scared of getting involved because of the lack of experience Dr. Brennan mentioned or the lack of someone to come along to tell businesses exactly what they need to do and how to fill in these funding applications?

With regard to what I referred to as closing the knowledge and awareness gap in Ireland, the big things are starting to be done.  For example, there are platforms like MyWaste.ie.  I know we have discussed that the circular economy is about more than just waste but, at the same time, from a household perspective, that can be the entry point.  Repair My Stuff is another example.  This is a collaboration between actors such as extended producer responsibility schemes, local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Those kinds of knowledge portals help people who search for \"circular economy\", \"repairing\" or \"Ireland\" on Google.  They come up and are a way to start investigating those things.  That is really helpful.  There are also campaigns on the radio or in other media.  There is no silver bullet with regard to creating awareness about anything in society.<\/p> <p>  Again, embedding the idea of the circular economy in the curriculum is important.  The Ellen MacArthur Foundation in the UK has a whole load of resources for teachers.  There is an opportunity for teachers to embrace this.  As part of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's outreach activity, in November we are hosting transition year students at Irish Manufacturing Research's facility in Mullingar.  The task they have been given is to communicate what the circular economy means for their schools.  They will do a video.  A multifaceted approach is needed rather than a single thing.  It is about embedding this in a range of different ways.<\/p> <p>  In order to support industry, we have created Ireland's first open-access circular economy knowledge library.  There is a great deal of information out there.  If you put \"circular economy\" into Google, you will get 2 million hits.  If you are new to the concept, it can be overwhelming to try to find the information that is relevant to you and that can help you.  As we roll out our supports to industry, we are coming across case studies, sectoral reports and policy documents from other jurisdictions.  They are there so that you know this is a good place to start if you are looking for the best - and I mean \"best\" in inverted commas - content.<\/p> <p>  With regard to local job creation, the circular economy can deliver in that space in two ways.  One is that if you are ultimately trying to create material substitutes from production residues, you are creating the potential for more regionalised, localised supply chains.  That, in turn, creates the potential for more jobs.  The circular economy also creates the potential for jobs in tertiary services like repair services.  The circular economy skill set initiative being piloted at the moment, which I highlighted in my opening statement, is about creating a training programme through the education and training boards to allow people to upskill with regard to repair.  It also includes a work placement element.  While this is being driven by industry and industry will want its own accredited repair technicians, there will ultimately be independent accredited technicians.  This creates an opportunity for other people to access and be a part of this.  As I highlighted in my earlier comments, it is about a multifaceted approach to how industry can work with social enterprise to deliver repair and manufacturing infrastructure to keep materials, components and products in use in the economy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the current understanding of the circular economy within industry, IBEC and the EPA launched a survey of IBEC members at the end of 2019.  I cannot remember the details but I can send them on to the committee afterwards.  I will follow up with the statistics but there was still quite a low level of awareness among Irish CEOs.  However, my experience through CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE and its activities is that with the publication of the climate action plan in 2019, the waste action plan for a circular economy and the pre-consultation on the circular economy strategy and associated Bill, this conversation is proliferating everywhere.  There are webinars.  There is a great deal of activity.  When I joined Irish Manufacturing Research, there was very little under way as regards the circular economy.  There were no jobs in that area.  From my perspective, this dialogue has exploded in Ireland over the last two or three years.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's last question was on the first piece of advice we give to businesses when they come through our doors.  One of the things we do, and have done with our founding members, is to ask companies to assess their baseline impact.  If you do not know and are not measuring your impact, how can you know if you have improved?  There is a diversity with regard to what is measured and what is not, depending on existing regulatory requirements, whether an organisation is digital or still paper-based and whether information is available.  It is a very poignant way to start this conversation.  You need to know what your impact is if you do not know already.  If you do know, are you really implementing the circular economy?  Sometimes companies are but they are not used to some of the jargon.  For example, they may do recycling, but that is recycling not the circular economy.  <\/p> <p>  We take them on a journey.  We tell them to start by measuring and ascertaining a baseline.  We have developed a self-assessment capability toolkit which our members can use to reflect on their current capabilities and their target capabilities across a range of dimensions so that they can then start that internal dialogue.  Ultimately, we recommend and undertake an in-depth circularity assessment on-site.  With regard to the likes of Visioncare, which was mentioned, we walk the site and look for examples of structural waste.  We then come back with a register of opportunities.  We say that this is what can be done with the companies' waste.  They might have to make an Article 27 or Article 28 application but there is value in the resource.  When I refer to waste, I refer to it in the broadest sense.  I mean underutilised capacity such as machines that are not being used.  Again, this can be complicated when it comes to insurance, but can a computer numerical control, CNC, machine be rented out to another smaller enterprise for it to use?<\/p><p>It is very complicated when it comes to insurance but, effectively, that is an asset that is wasted even though it is not waste.  Then we go on and develop that circular register of opportunities and action plan.<\/p><p> We emphasise the importance of collaborating with others.  As I said in the opening statement, the circular economy is not something you can do by yourself.  It is necessary to find parts of the supply chain that are willing to experiment with you to figure it out and, as in the examples of Freefoam Plastics, Glenveagh Homes, Mulligan Guttering Limited and Shabra Recycling, to try to create a take-back scheme for all the materials that go to six sites of Glenveagh Homes, which is packaging material and the plastics, and then see what the potential is for rolling that out across other materials or other practices.  To wrap this piece up, one of the reasons and the business case for creating CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE was that we needed examples of Irish-use cases and what worked and what did not.  There is plenty of best practice but it does not always niche naturally or automatically replicate for different reasons.  Until one tries, one does not know what those reasons are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>They were comprehensive questions and very comprehensive answers.

She mentioned insurance, which is something we discussed last week.  I am coming from the perspective of volunteers who organise things that require insurance.  It is a real difficulty in respect of the circular economy, as I see it.  Dr. Brennan might explain, from her point of view, what she believes are the financial barriers for companies and how we can overcome them.  Is there something we could put into this Bill?  Apart from the Bill, what do the Government and the country need to do to ensure all the financial barriers are overcome?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Brennan mentioned, either in her opening statement or in response to Deputy Bruton, the importance of regulatory certainty for companies.  Will she expand on that?  It is an important and interesting point when we are looking at new investment into Ireland.  What does that mean for companies?  Why is regulatory certainty so important?  I can probably anticipate what the answer will be, but it is important to have it on the record.  When it comes to maximising profit, as most companies are required to do, how does the circular economy fit into that?  It becomes important to have things in legislation when companies are trying to overcome that necessity of maximising profit, and how does that fit into a circular economy for the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#E00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>They are big questions.  As I said earlier, I have to be mindful of when I am speaking on behalf of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE industry members, based on the dialogues we have had and their feeding into the opening statement that we developed for coming here today, and of when I am speaking based on my experience.  The financial barriers will differ according to the different sectors.  Even though ours is a manufacturing platform, we work across food and drinks, plastics, automotive, medical devices, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the group that we cluster together as the second life enablers.  They will have different pinch points with regard to what the financial barriers are, so it is challenging to speak about the financial barriers in a general sense.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that many small and medium enterprises, SMEs, say, and I am speaking about SMEs rather than a sector, is that the compliance burden, regardless of any new compliance, is already substantial.  It means that when one asks them to comply and they do not have the reporting infrastructure set up - they are still paper based - that burden can make it challenging for them to innovate.  They know they need to, they know there is a resiliency driver and they know there is the resource price volatility.  Some of them have felt that during Covid.  That is a very strong driver towards saying, \"I have to get my head around this\".  Ultimately, in going towards action those financial barriers can be many because of the capacity of the companies themselves.<\/p> <p>  What we see as well is that this is a culture and mindset change for organisations.  We have many of the champions in the network.  Through our founding members, in particular, where we have gone and done assessments, we have been saying: \"It is not going to work if it is just you.  Everyone needs to understand what the circular economy means because it affects every aspect of your business\".  There is that piece of work to be done to embed this within an entire organisation, and that is a cultural transformation process.  Anyone who has worked in change management knows that it takes time to create the space to have those conversations, and then there are the day jobs that people have.  In terms of the financial barriers, there are the regulatory aspects where some companies have that competence and some of them do not.  There are new competences required.  There is the change process that is required.<\/p> <p>  In terms of trying to put this into the Bill, with the circular economy the devil is in the details.  That is why in response to the other question from Deputy Bruton about whether we can put these targets in now and whether we can put more in the Bill now, I would be wary, as somebody who has worked in this space and not speaking for the industry members.  There are so many nuances depending on the sectors, so trying to have a generic statement about these things could be very challenging.  It is about how to find the balance between having a strong intent, then a review and ensuring there is holding to account but without trying to be so general that it is not serving the purpose and intent behind the specifics.<\/p> <p>  With regard to regulatory certainty and why it matters, it comes back to the idea of a level playing field, which Deputy Bruton highlighted.  CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE is 37 actors out of thousands of businesses.  For some of those companies, going after the circular economy model ahead of others could sink their business if they fail.  The Senator highlighted maximising profits.  The circular economy will bring medium- to longer-term gains, but one has to navigate the bumps to get to those gains.  That is the piece where there is this tension between how to support companies and support them to take those risks because that is a fear for businesses when they do it.  Another piece that comes to mind is when somebody says: \"I did it and I did it wrong.  I did not understand Article 27 and Article 28 and now I am in trouble with the EPA and regulators\".  There is a genuine intent from our members to try to understand what this means and to put the best foot forward, but there is a fearfulness when it comes to engaging specifically with end-of-waste and by-product notifications that they will fall foul and then be in trouble.  There is this dynamic in the process.<\/p> <p>  I will add a caveat to my statement about the EPA.  All the industries know that there is a regulatory obligation and that Articles 27 and 28 are there to ensure there is no harm to human and ecosystem health.  However, when I and the team in CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE say to somebody, \"Guess what?  You can turn that production residue into a higher value application\", the person just looks at me and says, \"Oh great, where do I start?  How do I do this?\".  I say, \"You need to think about this and you need to speak to your enforcement officer\".  The nature of that relationship is changing with the circular economy programme in the EPA because the EPA is going to play a dual role, both as a regulator and also as a body to which industry can suggest an idea, ask whether it is good or bad, ask how to do it and how should it be done and so forth.  My apologies for going off on a tangent, but one of the points in our submission to the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications consultation on the circular economy strategy and the commitment to streamline Articles 27 and 28 was that there is the example of other jurisdictions that have created help desks where, effectively, industry can come in free of charge, say it has this thing that it is trying to do and ask for some guidance.  We do not have the full picture yet of how the Department and the EPA are proposing to streamline that process, but those types of supports which help business to meet the regulatory requirements and the targets can help to leverage the willingness that we see in CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE with regard to embracing this model.<\/p> <p>  I apologise if I have not been able to address all the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>That is very helpful.<\/p><p>The importance of regulation to ensure a level playing field is key to whether this will be a success or failure.  Companies have acted early in terms of energy.  Even though there are no regulations, some companies do it well and become embedded in communities, showing this approach has value.  Unless there is regulation, though, they will pay a higher cost.  Regulation is key to getting the circular economy right.<\/p><p> A number of the more specific points I am interested in have to do with tax generally, VAT specifically, and reselling.  There is a point for every company where it costs more to repurpose a machine than to send it to the dump.  It is the same for me in my house.  It costs me more to put ten buttons on an outfit than to dump it and buy another outfit.  This should not be a lifestyle choice for individuals or companies.  Instead, we as a Government should provide a means of making repurposing more viable financially than dumping it.  Part of this has to do with tax, insurance and the likes.  If Dr. Brennan has specifics to offer in this regard, it would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#E00500","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Apologies that I went broader and more macro.  Regarding tax, our members have highlighted that, if there were reduced VAT on repaired and remanufactured goods, it could create a level playing field.  Actually, it would not be a level playing field, so that is not the right analogy to use.  Rather, it could create an incentive for consumers.  This is about creating the markets and what kind of financial incentives the Government can provide to support the marketplace for circular product service systems.  I will emphasise the idea of a product service system.  Ultimately, the circular economy is about trying to create the infrastructure around products so that, when the Senator or I no longer need a piece of equipment, phone or some other fast-moving consumer good, there is a way of getting it back to either the original manufacturer or a retailer who can put it back into the marketplace.  Using VAT has been successful in other countries, for example, Sweden and France, specifically in respect of repairs.<\/p> <p>  Speaking in a personal capacity, there is an opportunity to gain understanding in this regard.  Repair is often viewed as separate to manufacture and the manufacturer's supply chain, meaning it is happening outside the manufacturer's control and influence.  Remanufacturing is about having a hybrid of accredited repair and independent repair.  One of the reasons the circular economy skill set initiative has been set up is that, to repair white goods to a high level, certain skills are required so that the repair person does not get hurt and the product functions.  From an EU and European Remanufacturing Council perspective, remanufacturing is a very specific thing.  The product in question has a particular type of guarantee, it is like new, and the consumer would never know its parts had been reused.  In my point, I was trying to say this was about trying to understand for which sectors and which types of product these different infrastructures could work together - social enterprise, independent repair versus manufacturer and its extended supply chain through an accredited repair process, and a hybrid of the two.  I do not see this as either-or but as trying to find synergies between both.  The tax aspect, including VAT, is important.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of actors from the waste electronic and ICT asset management sector in the CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE network.  They have highlighted that goods are sometimes essentially double taxed when putting them back onto the market.  There is a disincentive in some respects because of the tax structure.  I would like to follow up on this point and bring it to life with more details.  I want to do it justice because it is sector specific.

As I highlighted, over the past three years, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the momentum of the circular economy dialogue has blown up in Ireland.  There are various programmes, training and webinars as well as great excitement about this opportunity to innovate.  Yes, there is the question of how to get our heads around Articles 27 and 28, how to redesign our products and how to set up the infrastructure, but there is still a great deal of energy in favour of this idea.  In terms of whether we are at the races, we are at the starting line and the starter gun is about to go off, but everyone is at the race, which is the first thing that is needed before there can even be a race.  I hope this has not been too cheeky a response, but we are at the start.  CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE is 18 months old and there was nothing before it.  There were examples, but nothing that industry could engage with fundamentally.<\/p> <p>  In terms of providing assistance to industry in light of these being uncharted waters and there being unknowns, there has sometimes been a perception among CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's membership that it is too difficult and not worth it to go after grant money because people do not get the funds.  They put time and effort into doing 20- or 30-page applications and they do not get the money anyway.<\/p><p>I guess I am mindful that industry which gets this will invest the effort to apply.  The application process is not that easy for industry just to go after it.  The whole process is designed, I guess, to weed out people who are not serious about this.  Again, I am speaking on behalf of myself.  One must invest weeks to develop a proposal to go to CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's innovation fund, the green enterprise fund and the circular economy innovation grant fund, which was a little different because it was a smaller pot of money.  It was targeting not-for-profit social enterprise and microenterprise.<br\/><br\/>Again, I come from an organisation where we bring industry into these funds to try to help them to de-risk.  We then give them a case to scale it up.  When I speak about grants, I am not looking to do everything but to do the test, prove the case and go to the board to say it has worked in a certain context and it can be rolled out.  Those grants can be set up, separate to capital expenditure, where the payment is for the first de-risking and not everything.  Industry does not expect public funds to pay for everything.  Industry members in our dialogue are saying they need help to get out of the gates in this race.<br\/><br\/>There is the question around citizens and communicating the necessity for this.  It is very important again to acknowledge entities, which may have been discussed before, such as the Rediscovery Centre - the national centre for the circular economy - as an exemplar of engagement with civil society and education around what the circular economy means.  There are local repair groups and maker labs, so there is activity.  I am speaking on my own behalf rather than on behalf of industry members, but this is about how we profile activities and get people engaged with them.  If they do not exist, how can we support people in creating them?  Websites like <i>repairmystuff.ie<\/i>helps people who are interested in this.<br\/><br\/>Again, the circular economy was not in the mainstream press two or three years ago.  It was not in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>or the <i>Business Post<\/i>or different fashion magazines.  It is now <i>en vogue<\/i>and it is trendy to have upcycled things.  It is about tapping into that and creating ways to get the idea embedded more deeply.  It need not be a luxury but it can instead be an opportunity.<br\/><br\/>It is tangential but there is a point relating to this conversation in general.  The right to repair movement in Europe mandates that a company should effectively keep the components for goods in stock as inventory for ten years.  That is huge from a policy perspective and it creates the opportunity to keep goods in use in the economy.  I am mindful that, in previous meetings, the conversation indicated that Europe is driving this.  Taking the legislation and embedding it into the Irish system is fundamental.  It will all come in time.  I apologise if I have not answered questions directly.  I would be happy to elaborate further if members so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#F02200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>The answer was interesting and I agree with the points.

For example, we have worked with WEEE Ireland to map the flows of waste electronics through its system to bring this to life.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, a material flow analysis helps us to see the magnitude of flows.  It is almost like a hotspot analysis.  The Chairman is correct in asking whether the process is detailed enough.  Different tools, like material flow analysis and others, give a view of a system in the economy and give insights into leakage and loss, indicating how much is coming in and how much is leaving.  These insights are valuable, but once we have them, we will probably have more questions and need to do other things to get more answers.  That is again a bit of a roundabout response.<\/p> <p>  This is something other countries have looked at.  I do not know if the committee is aware of it but there is an effort in the Netherlands led by the circular economy to develop circular gap reports.  One was done based again on a material flow analysis of global inputs and outputs in the economy, and they are being done for different countries, such as the Netherlands and Norway.  They are looking to see what the results mean.  This is where tapping into the statistics and data from the Central Statistics Office and other entities can help us understand those flows.  It is not something a sector can do by itself because it will only have a partial view.<\/p> <p>  I hope I am not speaking out of turn on behalf of extended producer responsibility schemes like the European Recycling Platform and WEEE Ireland but, between those two, they should have the data.  They go through a process of reporting to get that data.  It is a unique case.

How should we approach this?  At one level, we have introduced a price for carbon and anybody who uses carbon pays a price, which relieves the State from funding it.  It does not relieve the consumer, who can choose products with a high carbon content but will pay more.  People choosing the circular economy may avoid carbon and their products will come to the shelves cheaper.<\/p> <p>  In trying to enable progress, where does the price of what economists might call externalities - bad practice - fit into this?<\/p><p>Underlining what Deputy Cronin asked is whether the taxpayer will be asked to pay for all business to do the right thing in this area.  I am interested in Dr. Brennan's insight into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#G00600","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>In response to the first question about the circular material reuse rates, Ireland is, as has been flagged, based on that metric perceived as a laggard in Europe.  This is in some ways related to the Chairperson's question about material flow analysis.  It is a matter of looking at the material flow and the recycling rate in an economy.  There is one view and one metric in the circular economy.  However, the complexity in measuring circularity is why it is the existing metric.  It is complex to measure.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman will allow me to go on a little tangent to answer this question, a lot of data are needed to develop the carbon footprint of a product based on virgin material but the point is that it can be mapped out.  As soon as that product is brought back in, some parts are taken away, new parts are brought in, some of them are used and extra labour, energy, materials and capital are added, the way in which the footprint is measured becomes more complex.  If that product goes back out into the market and comes back for a second time, the capturing of the carbon footprint and the impact of the product become more and more complex if you are not set up from the beginning to measure them.  The measurement is complex and is being tackled by experts.  For example, there is one International Organization for Standardization, ISO, technical standard specifically on circular economy performance and metrics.  There are 120 people from around the world who are experts in this space and are trying to grapple with this.<\/p> <p>  My point as to whether it is a worthwhile metric is that it is not necessarily the best metric but that, right now, it is the metric for which the data are available.  It is a crude metric but at least there are data to say something when it comes to benchmarking.  The Netherlands, for example, is at the top of this ranking in Europe.  It is saying it still needs to invest all this money to become circular because it has invested in the recycling infrastructure, it has been doing this for ten to 15 years and its material reuse rate is only 30% because its focus has been predominantly on recycling and it is investing in all these other activities.  When it comes to other metrics - and this is something the CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE members support - there need to be metrics for reuse, repair and remanufacturing, but when it comes to trying to roll this out to the level of the economy it becomes complex.  That is my position.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Bruton's point about who pays, sharing the cost of the change and the carbon tax, again, it would be prudent of me to speak to my expertise rather than that of the CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE members because there will be differing views on this within different sectors and among the membership.  What we see in Irish Manufacturing Research when we are asked to do feasibility studies on material substitutes or business cases for different aspects of implementation of circularity is that carbon tax comes into it because it means that by 2050 people will pay &euro;100 per tonne.  I completely concur with the Deputy that that is a driver for boards and their finance directors to say, \"I do not understand what this means for my business but I better figure it out.\"  Those taxes definitely have a role to play, but that consultation with industry to understand the scale of the tax and what other things will enable them to still operate while they are on this transition is important.<\/p> <p>  Have I addressed the Deputy's questions sufficiently?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Yes, but, presumably, the rest of this Bill looks at new things that should be levied.  There is, if you like, the grant approach, whereby the taxpayer foots the bill, or the identification of sources of damage and the placing of levies on them so they are internalised to the business.  I am seeking an understanding of the balance between the two.  Obviously, to the finance director of Ireland Inc., it makes a big difference whether all that money falls on the Exchequer to fund or whether it is shared in that way through well-designed levies and so on.  It seems to me that if this is to happen, we must have the stick as well as the carrot or it will become subject to the annual Estimates battle, whereby this will fight with the needs of our health service or our education system for funds and is likely to lose out in that battle.

The view, I think, in industry is that the stick is coming but is not here yet and that the carrots are there to help with driving the momentum.  Then, when the stick comes, if you have not figured this out from a competitive advantage perspective, there will be people who will be liable for those taxes and who will suffer and go out of business as a result.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that I think has been mooted for a very long time in academia is a shifting of taxes away from labour towards raw materials.  Again, I am not an economist so I will proceed down this line with caution, but it is a matter of understanding in what ways we can incentivise through taxes the use of perhaps secondary raw materials versus virgin raw materials and understanding how we can create incentives to utilise and reduce the taxes on labour if we are trying to incentivise repair in particular.  Those are ways to do this.  Again, I am happy to send on some examples of these ideas in the circular economy discourse within the academic area.  I refer to people such as Walter Stahel, who has spoken on RT&Eacute;'s circular economy hub.<\/p> <p>  Where this becomes challenging is always in implementation.  Conceptually, it is intuitive to say we should move taxes away from labour and put them on raw materials.  However, as to how that is done in the economy and the ramifications for those operators as to how those taxes are implemented, we do not want to put those businesses out of business automatically in the process.  Again, this is beyond my core area of expertise, so I am just flagging it.  Absolutely, there are areas that can be explored but with caution, given the fact that this is a transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan.

On a related matter, the reason that is important is that companies are legally obliged to maximise profit for their shareholders.  That is where we are at the moment, whereas Ireland Inc. is not obliged to do that.  That is the difference and we must take it into account to ensure everything companies are being asked to do will drive profit, which means we can put in place a stick to respond to the bad behaviour we do not want to see.<\/p><p> I was interested in Dr. Brennan's comment that this not just about upcycling and so on but also the whole area of reuse of machinery.  We have spoken a little about obsolescence, especially in the previous session.  Does Dr. Brennan have any insight into obsolescence in companies with respect, for instance, to the kind of machinery they are using?  Has she seen a shortening of the lifespan of some of that machinery or is there something in the background ensuring companies are not seeing the same level of obsolescence that we as end-users and consumers see?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#H00800","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The point the Senator makes about financial disincentives is a really important one.  Again, in terms of the dialogue we have had this morning, it is fair to say on behalf of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's members that they do not expect government to pay them to do this.  There are drivers, as I said, like resource-price volatility and like the resilience they have seen through Covid with supply chain shocks.  The price of logistics to import goods to Ireland has gone through the roof.  One company told us the price per container has increased from in the order of &euro;2,000 to &euro;10,000.  Multiple things are happening which make utilisation of locally or regionally produced goods - maybe not locally produced in Ireland but at least in Europe - much more viable and an option to consider financially than if those drivers had not been there.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right about the legal obligation on companies to maximise profit.  As part of the broader shift towards corporate governance, there is a recognition of corporate citizenship.  I am more speaking from my own experience in saying there is an awareness for those companies.  If we look at front runners in Europe and around the globe, they know that in order to retain staff, have good relations and do innovative things, it is not all purely about short-term profit.  There is a really good quote from a management guru whose name escapes.  Basically, it is that profit is like air; it is something we need to live but not the reason for living.  Enlightened organisations have at a senior level the understanding that they cannot afford not to make profit as they would otherwise go out of business but making profit is not all of what they are doing.  The circular economy represents an opportunity to look at themselves differently and to look at their supply chains and products and innovate.  That is another driver to why they will do this.  Some companies are doing this without government investment but, again, it is very different depending on their starting point, what they have and who they have in the organisations.  There are all these different contingencies as to why some companies just do it and others do not.  I emphasise that this is the start of a transition and it is about a cultural and mind-shift change.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's point about reuse of machinery and obsolescence for companies, when it comes to the capex-intensiveness of certain machinery, manufacturers are in a different headspace.  They understand the concept of keeping machines in use for as long as possible because of the nature of the investment.  This resonates with them.  If their machinery goes down, they cannot effectively produce.  Therefore, they have an incentive in the way their production lines work to try to keep these things functioning as best as possible.  From the perspective of the actual operations and production sites, this concept is not foreign.<\/p> <p>  The circular economy is intuitive for most people but actually implementing it is the problem.  It is not that they do not understand.  Keeping things in use makes sense.  As I heard when listening back to recordings of previous meetings, everyone says this is not a new idea.  Everyone gets that.  If everyone knows intuitively that we should do this, why do people not just do it?  The reason is that there are barriers in place, for example, certain material prices mean it is very difficult to substitute.  The cost of virgin new materials is still very cheap which means that if a company does the right thing, that will affect the cost of its fundamental products and supply chain.  Whether the end customer is willing to pay more is debatable.  Some customers are.  In business-to-business arrangements, we are seeing science-based targets.  COP26 is coming up.  That whole debate means companies want suppliers that are not necessarily giving them the cheapest component but something that allows them to say they are addressing their scope 3 emissions.  I apologise if that response was a little fragmented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>No, that is fine.  I was interested in the fact that one individual cannot put pressure on an industry to supply white goods, for instance, that have a long life.  I wondered if companies can do that more effectively because the legislation around obsolescence is, as we have seen, complex and difficult to implement.  Is there something in industry that makes this happen a little more easily than it would for an individual consumer?  Perhaps we do not know the answer to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021102100002#J00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>If I could come back to that using the example of a washing machine, it is what is referred to as a medium-lived complexity good.  This means it is something that already has an average life of between five and ten years depending on the nature of the product.  It is not a fast-moving consumer good, which is much harder to tackle.  Again, the white goods sector, the electronics sector, is probably a front runner when it comes to the circular economy.  The circular economy skills initiative to which I referred is the result of the White Goods Association, WGA, and WEEE Ireland, one of the two extended producer responsibility, EPR, schemes, basically saying they recognise that the Government will bring in reuse targets.  Reusing goods requires technicians who know how to repair them.  It is not that there is not a willingness but the sector does not have enough trained repair technicians.  That was the case that was made for the funding.  The industry said we needed a scheme developed to develop the skills needed to support us to keep things in reuse.  Again, that is driven by a number of factors across Europe and the European circular economy action plan, the ecodesign directive, the extension away from electrical goods, etc.<br\/><br\/>To respond to the Senator's point, this is definitely about sectors finding what the barriers to implementation are and then the Government working with sectors to help them unlock those barriers.  Again, CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE has given a relatively nominal amount, in the grand scheme of things, to WEEE Ireland, the WGA and Fastrack into IT to develop this curriculum in a year and a half and put people through it.  They have not even kicked off the pilot programme with the first cohort of students and already the education and training boards want to roll it out next year across three more ETBs.  I caveat this with all respect to the public investment.  The ETB will take this and roll it out across the country but it is the initial funding, which was almost seed funding in this case, to get out the gates, as it were, that is where the barriers lie.  The other thing to say about the likes of CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE's innovation fund is that like all funding, it is subject to state aid in <i>de minimis<\/i>.  It is not that this is just public money.  Industry in kind is bringing huge amounts of resources to get these things out of the gates.

There is a willingness across the country to do that.  If we could supply technicians to help with that, it would be important.  Dr. Brennan referred to the WEEE scheme and the White Goods Association working together on how best to efficiently recycle goods, where necessary, and support those who want to extend the lifetime of products.

Hopefully, this legislation will encourage industry and, more importantly, the public to think and act differently.  Dr. Brennan said it is about encouragement if nothing else.

There are ways public money can be used to support.  For our industry members, it is about de-risking that initial toe in the water, not necessarily the scale-up.

Climate-KIC is one of about ten knowledge innovation communities funded by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology to try to accelerate the transition to a zero carbon economy and spur climate innovation.  It came on board CIRCUL&Eacute;IRE and profiled the Slovenian case study to us saying that everyone looks at the Netherlands but the latter country is ten or 15 years out the gates and has sector-specific green deals.  This is a slight tangent but the green deals help create a forum for policymakers and sectors to go on a journey to look at and unpack the regulatory barriers.  They are two to three years long and they have done thousands of them over the past 20 years.  As Leslie Carberry said, they are best in class.  They are still doing it and their ambition is to be circular by 2050.  They know it is a long-term game but they are investing heavily in it.<\/p> <p>  Slovenia is an important case study for Ireland because it is not the Netherlands and has not been doing it for 20 years.  It has a smaller economy, close in size to that of Ireland.  It is also deemed to be a laggard but it has decided that there is an opportunity, with the right interventions, to learn from the leaders and embed this into the heart of economic policy development and, over a short period, progress.  The Slovenians have done it, much like Ireland is seeking to do with the circular economy Bill, by putting it on a statutory footing and looking at how to go on this journey over the coming years.  The case study outlined there is still high level because the process has started relatively recently.  It is an interesting one.<\/p> <p>  I went off on a slight tangent about Climate-KIC because it is working with the Slovenian Government and has, over a number of years, set up ways and what it calls deep demonstrators to have these dialogues.  It is different to the green deal which is a voluntary mechanism but it is about creating dialogues and demonstrator environments where you can pilot and test things and there is learning across sectors.

I completed my leaving certificate in 1999 and got accepted into DCU but due to lack of support, that is, the need of a personal assistant, PA, I was not in a position to enrol in the course.  It was this lack of independence that motivated me to find out information about how I could obtain a PA service.<br\/><br\/>Over the next number of years, I became involved in many disability organisations and was a representative for the Disability Federation of Ireland on the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s north-east co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability for over five years.<br\/><br\/>I completed a self-assessment and a brief outline of my daily routine and submitted it to my area manager in the HSE.  Throughout this time, I was constantly discussing my situation with my peers such as the late Martin Naughton, who were involved in independent living.  They had been managing their own personal assistance service via a service provider for at least 15 years and informed me that securing a direct payment and employing a personal assistant was the only way I would achieve independence in my life.<br\/><br\/>Eventually, after a long negotiation period, the HSE responded positively and I was offered 40 hours per week, which was less than half of what I needed to achieve total independence.  I was given the choice of negotiating with service providers, including the HSE, to get best value for funding and to find a service that met my needs.  As there was no service provider within the county providing a PA service, I contacted two not-for-profit organisations to see if they were in a position to administer my hours that had been allocated by the HSE.  However, through discussions with both organisations it became obvious that it was not going to be economically viable for either organisation to administer my service. This is due to the fact that when the administration costs were taken from my budget, the remaining hours were insufficient for my needs.<br\/><br\/>I then undertook a certificate in training with the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, a business course with Cavan Partnership, and began drafting a work safety statement and researching sole trader and limited companies.<br\/><br\/>In 2008, I registered as a sole trader with the Companies Registration Office, CRO, and set up a separate bank account for the business Independent Living Options, ILO, and acquired a payroll service.  The company also employs an accountant to audit the accounts every year.  In order to comply with regulations from the HSE, I then had to create ILO invoices, time sheets, medical clearance forms and safety statements and, subsequently in 2014, I had to enter a service level agreement with the HSE for governance purposes of my direct payment.  This entailed compiling numerous new documents such as risk assessments, complaints procedures and health and safety policies, to mention a few.  All of this was necessary to ensure correct management of my direct payment and to ensure continuation of my service.<br\/><br\/>Upon completion of the establishment of the business and the necessary company documents, I sourced a local agency to provide support as an interim measure for the first few months.  I soon learned how restrictive this service was due to the agency working specifically under the medical model of disability, that is, the lady could not accompany me outside the house, do certain tasks in the house, or could not give me my medication.  Subsequently, in March 2009, I employed my PAs directly through the company.<br\/><br\/>The defining difference between a PA and a carer is that the PA works completely under the direction of the person with the disability or the leader.  They assist the leader with everyday tasks such as personal care, social and domestic tasks that the leader needs to be completed but they do not &ldquo;care for&rdquo; the leader.  Unlike a homecare service, there is no care plan.  They work under the social model of disability.  A PA is often described as an extension of the limbs of the leader.<br\/><br\/>I then trained my PA&rsquo;s myself under the social model of disability and being mindful of the philosophy of the independent living movement.  During the training, my mother interprets my speech at the start and assists with the health and safety aspects.  My first priority when training a PA is to get him or her to the point where he or she understands my speech.  This takes approximately three weeks.  My PA&rsquo;s role as an interrupter to me is vital to my independence and to my participation and interaction with other people who may not be familiar with my speech.<br\/><br\/>When the induction training is completed, the PA works solely under my direction at all times. This allows me to have control over my own life, make my own day-to-day decisions, as well as to attend meetings and social functions, complete daily living tasks and achieve independence in my life.<br\/><br\/>On a number of occasions over the past 13 years, I have used homecare agencies as a stop-gap measure in between recruiting new PAs.  I found that the service they provide, in comparison to a self-directed personal assistance service, is totally inadequate.  In addition to this, the associated costs of obtaining these agencies results in less than half the amount of hours I receive from employing my PA directly.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion, there seems to be absolutely no accountability for these care providing agencies unlike a personal assistance service where strict governance guidelines can be upheld by the person with the disability.  This is due to the person with the disability being in control of his or her own decision-making, his or her own service and his or her own autonomy.<br\/><br\/>This social model of disability underpins the principles of the UNCRPD.  Article 19 of the UNCRPD states: <\/p> <blockquote> \t... Parties to the present Convention recognize the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others ... have access to a range of in-home, residential and other community support services, including personal assistance necessary to support living and inclusion in the community, and to prevent isolation or segregation from the community; <\/blockquote> <p>Providing people with disabilities with the opportunity to avail of a personal assistance service not only gives control back to the individual but also fulfils Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to Article 19 of the UNCRPD.  As there is no legal right to a personal assistance service in Ireland, people currently negotiate on a piecemeal basis directly with the HSE.  The lack of legislation and clarity around personal assistance services diminishes the rights of people with disabilities.  The challenges I faced with obtaining a personal assistance service are not unique to me.  This is an obstacle many people with disabilities face throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>In 2019, as part of a national campaign, I lobbied Cavan County Council with a motion for the right to a personal assistance service.  This was passed unanimously at local level.  I hope this is one small step to enshrining the legal right to a personal assistance service for people with disabilities in Ireland.<\/p><p> It is important to create legislation underpinning the right to a personal assistance service and to promote independent living in Ireland, subsequently upholding the principals of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.

I have spent the past eight years of my life interacting with various agencies across the disability sector, including child disability services and the medical system, as well as attempting to navigate and advocate for my children within the education sector and in life in general.<\/p> <p>  As a parent and full-time family carer, the past eight years have been extremely eye-opening.  I have come across obstacles I never dreamed of and genuinely, the fight to not only obtain support but to also keep it has been absolutely exhausting.  In my submission, I wrote about how becoming a parent to children with disabilities massively impacted every facet of my life.  I knew from reading accounts from other parents of children with disabilities and adults with disabilities how lacking supports and services are, but it was not until I experienced them myself, that I truly realised how completely under-resourced and broken they are. <\/p> <p>  My daughter requires 24-hour care seven days a week.  She literally relies on those around her to help her navigate life.  I foolishly believed that because of the level of care she requires, we would not have to fight so hard and would receive better support than we did with her brothers, which was fairly sparse.  In comparison to my daughter, they would be fairly independent within reason.  Due to the lack of services and supports within society, we have had to rely on a family member to help us secure a suitable family home and save non-stop in order to make that family home suitable for her, the works for which have not been completed, because, quite frankly, the money it will take to do the adaptation and allow her some semblance of privacy in her home is just currently beyond our means.<\/p> <p>  As I sit here today in front of the committee, my child does not have access to her own bedroom or accessible bathroom and is relying on her family members to carry all 17 kg of her up and down the stairs multiple times a day to access what the average person takes for granted.  My daughter is also ageing out of the charity support we need that provides the only small bit of respite we receive, which is nursing hours.  Regardless of the chasing being done, we cannot get an answer on how or by whom this charity support will be replaced, which is terrifying, as it is the only form of respite we get.<\/p> <p>  My daughter is also a full-time wheelchair user which presents its own challenges, including transportation.  We live rurally and have no public transport system that would be accessible to her.  In order to transport her from her house - literally anywhere - we had to fundraise for a wheelchair accessible van.  Fundraising was our only option.  The chair my daughter needed meant the car we were driving was not suitable.  There was an element of time constraints and we had no other means or options to fund the van. <\/p> <p>  Education is also an area many take for granted, but which presented us with many obstacles.  This started at the preschool level when we had major issues securing funding to send our daughter over a county boundary to her special needs preschool which is ten minutes away, as it is the type of preschool needed for her, rather than sending her more than 30 minutes away to the special needs preschool in our county, because, that is how the protocols were set up.  The transition from preschool to primary school again presented obstacles, not with my daughter, but rather the system and having to attempt to get the appropriate equipment from one building to a building ten minutes away.  I never envisioned so much bureaucracy, red tape and delays with her getting and receiving the equipment she needs to access her daily school life. <\/p> <p>  We also experienced the education system from a different perspective with my two autistic sons who attend primary and secondary mainstream schools.  As I am sure the committee knows and has heard from various sources within the media, support systems are varied depending on location, school type and even the principal, especially now that the distribution of support services is decided at the school level and can be dependent on the opinion of the principal of the needs of your child.  In our case, it has meant at the primary school level, considerable advocating to ensure my children received not only support but the adequate type of support.  The last part is key, because, so often the type of support is decided by someone who does not have the intimate knowledge of the support needed, as the person who needs it or his or her caregiver. <\/p> <p>  I wish to raise the financial implications of having a loved one with a disability.  The lack of services and supports mean many times in the past we have had to privately access services, due to there not being therapists available or those therapists only being available to order and adjust equipment, rather than provide regular sessions to work on the issues my children face.  A premium also seems to be placed on equipment once it is discovered to be needed for those with disabilities.  This means car seats, seating systems and even occupational therapy items can become expensive and families end up with very long waiting periods to get equipment or if teams deem it as not essential, but rather a want, it is not funded at all.<\/p> <p>  In our life examples, this includes a chair my daughter relaxes in.  The average person enjoys nothing more than coming home and sitting on a couch, but in my daughter's case, it was expected that she should use continually the chair that is very upright and used for activities and eating - akin to someone being expected to sit and watch TV on a dining chair instead of a sofa.  We had to source the appropriate seat ourselves, which comes with the added stress. <\/p> <p>  It has, in my experience, been vastly different to what is so often portrayed in the political sphere when accessing services and supports in life.  The funding is not there, the therapists are not available or hard to source or it is hard to fill any open positions; the services are extremely limited and most of them are Dublin-centric and provided by charity, including respite care services and nursing.  I thank the committee for inviting me here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Hello to both Mr. O'Reilly and Ms Kenny, with a special hello to Mr. O'Reilly, as a fellow Cavan person.  It is good to see him.  They have raised many issues.  What is common to what both of them have said and indeed what we have heard from other people, is the fight for everything.  It is a constant battle to get services they require.  Mr. O'Reilly mentioned he was involved in disability groups and represented the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, in consultation with the HSE.  What sort of experience was that?  Did he feel he was listened to or did he feel it was a box-ticking exercise and the HSE went ahead and did what it was going to do anyway?  He also talked about a personal assistance, PA, service and the struggle he had to get one, which is outrageous.  There is a need for a standardised and properly-funded PA service and personalised budgets for individuals that reflect their needs.  How does Mr. O'Reilly envisage that?  That will happen if we are to realise the implementation of the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  Ms Kenny talked about a number of issues.  She referenced education and transport.  As we know, disability is not just a health issue, it affects all Departments.  I want to talk to her about disability awareness, which she has said is needed.  That is very important in that the people who will be dealing with disabled people need to be aware of their needs.  It is based almost on funding, which we know is insufficient or badly organised and spent and not always cost-effective.  It is not cost-effective to delay interventions.  We need to move away from the medical to the social model.  Can Ms Kenny expand on the disability awareness training and a common-sense approach to disabled people?<\/p> <p>  There is too much bureaucracy and red tape, as Ms Kenny said, even for her to try to send her child to the nearest preschool that suits her needs.  Just because it was across the border in a different county, there were issues.  That demonstrates the lack of common sense and the amount of bureaucracy attached to such things.  I thank the witnesses and look forward to their answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#C00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Which of the witnesses want to respond first to Deputy Tully's points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#C00500","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Regarding the first question, I really enjoyed my time on the committees.  I thought they were really worthwhile.  I do a lot of voluntary work.  It is hard to keep up with one's day-to-day activities as well as participate, but it was well worth it.  I often think that the voices of people with disabilities are not heard.  It is often the organisations that speak on behalf of the people.  The people with disabilities do not get the opportunity.  That is my experience and that is the experience of other people with disabilities too.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about the PA service, I feel like, maybe, there should be a section within disability services that can provide some sort of administrative support for personal assistant services such as organising payroll, sourcing insurance, support in recruitment, HR, etc.  If this were to come to pass, it would be very important that the staff of such departments understand the principles of the personal assistant service and the philosophy of independent living.  They would need to understand what a PA is and the differences between a PA and a carer.  There are many differences.  For example, a carer cannot go outside the house, but the individual and a PA can and that gives more independence to the person.  I hope I have answered the question.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly for those powerful answers to the questions.

One of the things that I find very hard is the number of hoops we have to jump through.  We have to prove that the level of need is there and then we have to write all of that down.  We have to fill out a massive amount of forms.  I am speaking not of one or two pages but 18, 20 and 30 pages.  You spend your entire life advocating for your child and then you have to strip that child down to his or her medical diagnosis, which is soul destroying.  When you send the forms off, you are literally at the whim of somebody else deciding whether (a) what you said is true, (b) whether he or she is of the same opinion as you because they do not have as much interaction with your child and (c) even if you are grant aided you then have to go through the rigamarole of paying upfront and waiting for an inspector to come to the house to confirm that the work, in his or her opinion, is done and then you get the grant.  That is what happens if the application is financial.  If it is for equipment and other stuff, there is a constant proof of need.  Therapists have their own opinions on what a child may need because they are not around the child 24-7.  On top of that, they have to look at their funding.  Sometimes funding wins out over need.  <\/p> <p>  There is network of families behind the scenes, that I am sure politicians do not see, who are literally handing disability equipment to each other that they have had to fundraise for.  It is soul destroying watching the family of a child who has passed on dismantle a room and hand over equipment to another family.  I do not think people realise that happens, but it does.  That is literally solely because other families cannot get funding or equipment.  They also may not have access to a therapist at the time.  During the pandemic, we lost our therapists.  The most profoundly disabled child in my household had no therapist during the pandemic.  We were reliant on a pool of therapists, if they could get to us.  Our therapists were redeployed.  The decision was taken that they were needed elsewhere and, again, we took the hit.  I understand that was important in light of the pandemic, but my child's disability did not disappear just because a virus hit.  My child grew and she needed access to therapists for equipment and for adjustments and they simply were not there.  That happens time and again.  We seem to always take the first hit.  When there are budget cuts, we take the first hit and we are forgotten about most of the time when there is money available.<\/p> <p>  As for disability awareness, the medical model does not work.  If you read the diagnosis of my child and then looked at my child, they are two completely separate things.  My child does not fit into boxes.  No matter how much you try to fit her into a box and check that down, it does not work like that.  There is an element of nurture in every household and every disabled person is represented differently based on the environment he or she is in as well.  There needs to be a look at each family.  We need to look at the needs of the family, not just the person because the person is not separate to the family.  The person is integrated into a unit.  That is completely forgotten as well.  They are important elements that people need to take home and look at.  As I said in my submission and my opening statement, there is an element of \"they can make do with what they've got\".  An average person would not be expected to \"make do\" yet my child is expected to do \"make do\".  I find that disgusting, to be honest.  I do not think it is fair that she has to \"make do\" because she has a disability.  I hope that answers some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

I have had previous engagement with Ms Kenny, particularly around education for her daughter and the manner in which the pandemic impacted on her.<\/p> <p>  My initial questions are for Mr. O'Reilly.  He and Ms Kenny spoke about the importance of mothers in terms of fighting for their children and the optimum they need and having to settle then for less than that.  Mr. O'Reilly has inherited his mother's tenacity and persistence.  I thank him for advocating for her peers as well as for himself.  It is important that the committee has an opportunity to listen to lived experiences.  Mr. O'Reilly made the point that much of the time it is organisations who speak for him and his peers and that his voice is more important than that of the organisations.  It is incredibly important to us.  I want to assure him of that.  <\/p> <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Pauline O'Reilly about his role in terms of participating in meaningful consultation Mr. O'Reilly said that while he enjoyed it and found it worthwhile it was also difficult to do because he gets only half the number of PA hours he needs and he uses many of those hours to participate in the consultation.  In terms of his personal life, he is lacking PA hours.  I ask Mr. O'Reilly to comment on what difference the extra 40 hours would make to him, how important it is that other people with disabilities get involved in the consultation and what recommendations we can make that would help that process.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Reilly referred in his submission to getting control back and how important that is.  He might tell us a little bit about the inaccessibility that he has experienced in public health.

For starters, getting rid of the backlog of the assessment of need impacted those already in disability services.  I do not think people realise that.  Because they could not find therapists, we lost therapists to redeployment in order for them to tackle that backlog.  I understand an allowance was given to disability services to backfill but they could not find therapists.  There were no therapists available to backfill so, again, we lost therapists for that backlog to be tackled.  I do not think people are aware of that and that needs to be raised.<\/p> <p>  As for accessing interventions, all they have done is tackle one waiting list that had legislation protecting the people on the waiting list and put them on a waiting list with no legislation.  That is what they have done.  That is my view of it.  Now those children are going to be left waiting for services because even though we have had an announcement of all these extra therapists, we now have to find people to fill up those places with therapists.<\/p> <p>  My daughter is apparently currently supposed to have a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, OT, a speech and language therapist and a social worker.  We only regained an occupational therapist after joining the School Age Team back in July.  We are using an out-of-area physiotherapist because we do not have a physiotherapist and we have no speech and language therapist.  I have a social worker who is not easily contactable and that is for the child with profound needs.  The children with autism are under physiotherapy care but their physiotherapy involves them having inner sole appointments and that is it.  They are as and when needed, which normally results in an annual appointment.  That is it.  I end up taking them to private physiotherapy that we have to budget for because otherwise they do not get the care that they need.  The model is literally like putting sticking plasters on gaping wounds.  The physiotherapists have so many kids, so many hours and so many needs to take care of that they cannot adequately take care of all the needs they have, which means either that children are left waiting or the children accessing services are not given the adequate services they need.<\/p> <p>  On the interventions, my youngest daughter would do great if she had similar stuff that they have in the US but we cannot access that because we just do not have the funding or the therapists.  The model seems broken.  It would be great if she had access to regular physiotherapist and OT visits but instead we get equipment adjustments.  My daughter has leg splints, therefore, it is leg splints, measurements and adjustments.  That is what our visits are for.  That is all we get because that is all that can be provided.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the issue of housing adaptation, which is a rigamarole in itself.  First, you must fill in the application form.  Then the council OT comes through and decides what you need in your home.  You do not decide what you need; the council OT decides what you need.  Then you must attempt to find builders to try to get quotes for everything and quotes for equipment.  Then, even when you send that off, in our case, our quote was for &euro;30,000 for the amount of work that needs to be done.  The council came back and gave us a grant quote of &euro;15,000.  We now have to find the extra &euro;15,000 but in reality, we have to find &euro;30,000 because we have to pay the builder upfront.  The work has to be done.  Then the council sends an inspector out to make sure the work is done as per the report and gives us the grant back retrospectively.  For us to start work on an adaptation, therefore, I have to find &euro;30,000, even though I am eligible for receipt of a grant for &euro;15,000.  That is a huge amount of money.  I am not alone in this.  There are people out there who need larger adaptations than we need.  We are very fortunate that we have the capability to ask for help from other people because not many people have that.  To date, we had a grant initially given to us back in 2018.  It is three years on and I still do not have the adaptation done because I simply do not have the finances in place to do it.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked what three things I would change.  Adequate interventions would be great, as in if kids needed physiotherapy to have regular exercises, stretching out sessions and massaging or regular OT appointments in order that they could be continually assessed so that as their needs change, their plans of care could change.  That would be great.<\/p> <p>  Some sort of financial support is needed.  I know people say we have carer's allowance.  Carer's allowance is a means test.  Not everybody gets it.  In fact, there are hundreds of thousands of carers out there who do not get carer's allowance.  Then on top of that, not only are they incumbent to their husband or partner to be the sole financial earner and their value is placed on that financial earner, they may also have difficulties accessing loans.  In our case, we have severe difficulties accessing loans because they looked at our financial circumstances, said we had three lifelong dependents and stated that we would not be able to pay back a loan because we have three lifelong dependents.<\/p><p>We were unable to access loans.  We need some type of financial support.  I am not saying we want money given to us, we would like options whereby we can look at loans that take account of our circumstances and that do not just exclude us because we have children with disabilities.<\/p><p> The final thing that would help is respite care.  The only respite care I get is ten hours nursing care from the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation for my daughter and eight hours of home support help for one of my autistic children.  They need a break away from me as much as I need some time to myself.  During the pandemic, my daughter has spent the past 18 months staring at four walls and my face aside from going to school.  Imagine if any other person had to do that.  What kind of life is that for anybody?  If she went away to respite care, she would be able to have her own holiday with her friends and support workers who would be able to take care of her in the way that she wanted it done, without having to do exactly what mammy tells her she has to do all the time.  Respite care services are predominantly provided by charities.  In many cases, especially in our area, they are not even open for applications because they are so under-resourced and demand is so high.  Respite care is something we really need to examine.  In the case of my family, I have not had a night away from my children since 2014, when I was married, and the last holiday I had was in 2002.  This is 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Kenny, for your honesty and for being so up front.

Two things struck home with me massively when they were talking.  One is what Mr. O'Reilly said about the 40 hours of support that were offered to him, which was less than half of what he needed to achieve independence.  That is very stark and, unfortunately, tallies with what Ms Kenny has just told us about potentially getting grant aid towards 50% of the housing adaptation requirement that would give her daughter greater independence.  How Ms Kenny has spoken is a reminder to us all of the struggle and the fight for support that parents and families of children with additional needs have to go through.  That is wrong.  Every member of the committee believes that is wrong and we are here because we want to try to change that.  People are already under so much pressure when they have to cope with additional needs in their family that the last thing they need is forms, which Ms Kenny described as soul destroying, being thrown at them repeatedly and having to fight for every little bit of support that comes their way.  That is what we want to change.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for each of the witnesses.  Mr. O'Reilly spoke about the process of sourcing his own PA service.  It sounds cumbersome.  It sounded like an unfair responsibility to put on people.  I am interested to hear from him how he thinks it could be improved.  I am not sure if I heard him correctly but I thought he said that administrative duties was an additional complication that had to be taken out of the budget or perhaps taken out of his hours.  Perhaps he could explain that a little further, as well and give us some advice as to whether that is something in which we can make changes.<\/p> <p>  One of the many issues Ms Kenny highlighted as an advocate for her children is an issue I have encountered in Lucan in my constituency, which is close to the border with Kildare.  It is that county borders are effectively becoming eligibility criteria for certain services.  In Ms Kenny's case, it was for preschool.  This is something we have discussed in the committee previously so I would be interested to hear Ms Kenny's views on how we could deal with that.  I would love to remove that countywide barrier, as it were, and it has been a recommendation of this committee.  If we inserted county and-or a 30 km radius, does she think that would be helpful or would it still be very restrictive?  I want to hear her opinion on that because that is something very practical we could do quite quickly, and one would imagine it would have quite a big impact on a number of families.<\/p> <p>  Those are my two questions.  I thank both of the witnesses for their contributions.  They were very moving, unfortunately.  I am very sorry that both of them are in this situation whereby barrier after barrier is put in their way when it comes to accessing services.  That is not what any of us wants, and we genuinely want to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#F00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Will Mr. O'Reilly reply first and then we can go to Ms Kenny?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#F00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Yes.  Regarding the process of obtaining a PA service, there is no proper process in place.  I know that sounds stupid but it really depends on where somebody lives in the country, which is wrong.  It should not depend on where somebody is located in the country.  Regarding the administration and my direct payments, I do all the administration with the support of my mum.  Therefore, the money that would be spent through an agency paying the agency to administer it goes straight back to me in regards to hours, so I would end up with more hours when there is less time being spent on administration.  That in turn gives me more independence because my hours are not taken up on administration costs.  It is a lot of work complying with everything, with grant aid agreements and all the documentation.  People with disabilities do not want to have to do this but they have to because there is no alternative.<\/p> <p>  I have a friend in Cavan and he is in the same boat as me.  As there is no provider of a PA service in this region, where does he go?  He cannot access a PA service.  At present, he has home carers but he cannot leave his house.  He lives in Cavan town and has all the amenities beside him but he cannot leave his home to avail of them, even just to go to the shop.  His father, who would have assisted him, took ill a couple of months ago, so he does not know what to do now.  He does not know where to go.  This is the problem.  There is no independence for people.  A person is essentially a prisoner in the person's home.  Then a person cannot become involved in organisations and have his or her voice heard.  It is just wrong.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":503,"content":"<p>On county borders, I do not think people realise how much they impact on everything, including on funding and therapists.  We live in south Kildare and in our case my daughter attends school in Carlow.  The special needs preschools are not funded under the early childhood care and education model but by the HSE directly, and the HSE looks at county boundaries for funding.<\/p><p>We had to get a special allowance to go to a preschool ten minutes away rather than, for easiness and lack of bureaucracy, to a preschool 30 minutes away in the opposite direction, which would also be in the direction I take with my other children.  If she takes sick, I have zero way of doing basic tasks such as collecting my other children from school and trying to collect her from preschool at the same time.  That is why we opted for one ten minutes down the road.  I had to go to the media to get funding for a preschool ten minutes across the boundary because there was so much bureaucracy and people were not signing paperwork.  I literally had to go to the media to get funding for a preschool.<\/p><p> County boundaries also affect the therapists.  Because my daughter lives in County Kildare and attends a school in County Carlow, any therapy work she needs doing in school has to be done by the Kildare therapists.  Even though a visit might be happening in school by Carlow-based therapists, they cannot do anything with my child and I have to arrange an appointment from her therapy team in Kildare.  This new model, which is removing therapists from school, is now going to happen nationwide.  Therapists are being removed from schools.  Her school does not have a therapist and only has nurses.  Every time she needs a seat adjustment or a stander adjustment, which might only take 20 minutes, her therapist has to travel more than 40 minutes to do a 20-minute seat adjustment because no local therapist can do it and there are no therapists in the school anymore.<\/p><p> County boundaries are not just about funding.  Imagine how much money we could save if we did not have therapists travelling for an hour at a time to do one single 20-minute visit and if we had a team of therapists who just went around the schools in the locality.  They could take care of basic care, such as making sure standers were adjusted correctly or making sure the chairs the kids were using were okay.  If there were issues in the school, they could ensure an OT session was put in place so a schedule could be changed.  Instead, we have therapists travelling from 40 minutes to an hour to see one child for 20 minutes.  That is the bureaucracy we are facing.  It is ridiculous.<\/p><p> Even this 30 km radius would not work for my child because my therapist centre is 40 km away from her school.  This needs looking at on a deeper level because the county boundary model is not working; it really is not working.  Again, we are going to have kids waiting for seat and stander adjustments because therapists have to factor in 40 minutes of journey time to go and to do this one thing or to try to make sure that all the kids they have in the one school are in school on the exact day they happen to visit, which, as we know, cannot be done because if the child is sick, the child is sick.  It is just not working.  In my opinion, if we even had a local team of therapists who just did school visits, that would take a massive amount of work off therapists and they would be freed up to provide more care for people in an in-depth, more personal manner.  If this happened, we would have kids not just accessing appointments for equipment assessments.  They would be able to access therapists when parents are having issues or if the child is having issues, and they could have one-on-one sessions because we would not lose therapists who have to go and visit a school an hour away.  If we had a therapist for the school side and therapists who did the day-to-day stuff, that would make a massive difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I extend my deep gratitude and respect to each of our witnesses.  It can be daunting and even sometimes retraumatising to have to recount all of the ways in which the State is failing their children and their families.  These are difficult matters to talk about, much the same as it is upsetting to even hear the difficulties and, as has been explained quite aptly, the lack of common sense in the approach.  The lack of person-centredness is what stands out from what has been said so far.  I want to say &ldquo;hats off&rdquo; to both of our witnesses.  On behalf of the committee, I can say it is experiences like theirs that will make the difference to the work we do.<\/p> <p>  Only 9% of, or approximately 56,000, disabled people access specialist community-based disability services, which is a figure so low that I was genuinely shocked to learn it.  I have become increasingly aware of how many gaps there are in disability service provision in this country but I did not imagine it to be that low.  These specialist services are actually standard services if people are disabled, and include early intervention, personal assistant services and assistive technology.  They are the baseline.  If we truly want disabled people to be able to fully and meaningfully participate in society, it is very sad that only one in ten have access to these supports.<\/p> <p>  I will move to questions.  Will Mr. O'Reilly comment on the tension between service providers and disabled people's organisations?  What I mean by this is that we have seen the announcement of another budget for 2022 where an additional 120,000 personal assistant hours were granted, which is less than one hour per disabled person spread out over the entire year.  I know that not every disabled person would benefit or like to avail of personal assistance but it is helpful to ground the proud announcements in what it will mean for people in concrete terms.  Was Mr. O'Reilly involved in the personalised budget pilots and, if so, what where his takeaways from that experience?  What does he think the barriers will be to expanding the personalised budgeting model moving forward?  What does he think it will take for there to be a radical move away from funding service providers to actually funding more empowering supports, such as personal assistance?<\/p> <p>  I want to express to Ms Kenny how harrowed I was to hear of her situation, whereby her children were essentially being transferred from one waiting list to another based on their age group and not making it to the top of any of these lists in a sensible time.  I know first-hand how frustrating it is when one of your children is not getting the supports they need.  For Ms Kenny in particular, having more than one child in this challenging situation must have been even more difficult.  My party has been advocating for integrated waiting lists across the board within the HSE to manage waiting times and stamp out some of the bureaucratic inefficiency that leave people in limbo for years.  There needs to be joined-up thinking and we have known this for quite some time.  I completely agree with Ms Kenny in that regard.  I want to ask her about the additional challenges she faces, as a mother with children with additional needs, and the financial burden that puts on her.  I also ask her to speak to the inadequacy of the means test for carers allowance in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#G00300","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Regarding the first question on the relationship between the service provider and the users, many of the organisations administering the payment are not DPOs.  They are running the services but they are not engaged with disabled people.  There are able-bodied people running the service in the way they think they should, but they are not asking people with disabilities what they need or what they require, and they are not consulting disabled people.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the budget regarding personal assistant hours.  One of the problems with this is that a lot of that money will be spent on administration as opposed to going to straight into services to be used by the individual.  This is the main problem in that the administration costs on the payment are very high.<\/p><p>Disabled people have to sacrifice hours of support just to manage the funding in the first place.  The money equates to hours so the money being taken to pay for the administration costs means fewer hours for the individual.  The Deputy also mentioned the personalised budgets pilot.  I was not involved in this pilot project because my company had been set up when it came into effect.  I know of other people who engaged in that pilot but they had the same problems.  There was not that much support for the individual during the project.  There was really nobody to answer questions or assist those involved in the pilot.

As a family, we have been accessing disability services for eight years.  My oldest son received his diagnosis via the HSE after a lengthy wait for an assessment of need.  He fell through the cracks because the services in our area were undergoing a transition to the pilot scheme that is now being rolled out nationwide.  He did not receive any services for nearly three years.  They did not know he existed.  His case was only discovered because the school sought an in-school visit, following which I got a phone call from the disability services who literally said they did not know my child existed because he had fallen through the cracks during the transition.  That was interesting.  That was six years ago.<\/p> <p>  As we are six years on and have had six budgets and increases in funding and therapist numbers, I find it astonishing that, when my youngest daughter transitioned from the early intervention team, where she had some therapists, to the school-age team, she was given none because the team had none to give her.  It was not even that she was on a waiting list.  She was already in services but, because there were no therapists, she was not given one when she transitioned.  It is not even that the disability services model needs funding, but that it needs to be looked at as a whole.  They are struggling to get and retain therapists.  They are struggling for funding.  The lengthy waiting lists will not be resolved by just throwing money at the issue if we have no one to take up the roles.  That was what happened in my daughter's case.  The services had open positions they were struggling to fill and no therapists were available to her.  She requires a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a speech and language therapist and we, as a family, require a social worker because I cannot manage it all by myself.  The disability services model does not only have an issue in respect of waiting lists, but also in respect of those already in services.  <\/p> <p>  As for the means test on carers, I will have to take a breath before answering.  I understand that the threshold for the means test for the carer's allowance was increased in the budget.  This was met with triumphant fanfare but I want to stop for a moment and try to let people understand that this is the first increase in 13 years.  An average private sector employment contract will have a clause written into it to allow for a 2% incremental increase year-on-year to protect against inflation.  That change to the means test will not cover anybody who was close to the threshold if their husband, rather than themselves, received a 2% pay increase year-on-year for the past 13 years.  They will not have been snatched back into the net.  All the increase has done is to bring back into the net those who lost carer's allowance over the past 13 years or those whose circumstances are now so dire that they fall under the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>  It has left hundreds and thousands of carers without any financial support.  Their financial value is tied to the financial viability and potential to earn of their husband or partner.  My value as a carer is seen by the State in terms of the potential earnings of my husband rather than in terms of the 24-hour care I provide to one child or the fact that I have three children with disabilities.  On that note, carer's allowance is only paid in respect of one and a half of my children.  Do I pick which child and a half I am to take care of, because that is all I am paid for?  That is how it works.  My value as a carer is not based on the fact that I take care of my daughter 24-7, that I spend my life advocating to try to make society better for her or that I help my two other children gain some form of independence so that they might, one day, be able to leave the family home in some semblance; rather it is based on how much my husband earns.  Carers are given a certain amount based on how much their husbands earn.  That leaves us wide open to abuse because when that allowance is taken away based on a means test, people are left without an income.  This means that, if they are in an unhappy marriage or partnership, they are only given money at the whim of their partner.  They are unable to work.  I am unable to work.  I have an agricultural degree I have never used because I am unable to work.  It is insulting that this is how value is placed on me.  <\/p> <p>  I actually sat down and worked out the figures.  An incremental pay increase of 2%, which is what is included in an average private sector contract, would add &euro;877.45 over that period.  Even a non-incremental increase, adding 2% for every year of the past 13, which is what is included in the average contract to protect against inflation, would add &euro;845.  We are offered &euro;750.  That represents an annual income for two people of &euro;38,900.  That is not a lot of money to raise a family on at all.  That is the starting cut-off point and you may still receive some carer's allowance if you go slightly over it, but that is the value being placed on me.  I am very upset about the means test and the carer's allowance situation as a whole.  I do not feel valued, seen, respected or recognised for the role I play in society.  I am very sorry if I am coming across as very emotional but this is a very emotional issue for me.  This is the life I am living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Their comments today have been powerful.  I firmly believe that there should be special cases and allowances for particular situations which carers face and that there should not be a means test in these cases.  Means testing carer's allowance is not right in general but, in Ms Kenny's case and other genuine cases, carer's allowance and more should be provided for the work being done.  No money could equal the value of that work.  In her case and others, such a great service is being provided for the State.  All these cases genuinely need to be looked at.  I am a proud Carlow woman.  Ms Kenny spoke about the boundaries.  I am very aware of the boundaries in Carlow.  We have excellent schools in Carlow but the boundaries are unacceptable.  A disability does not know any boundary.  Despite this, there are guidelines on boundaries within the policies of the HSE and Departments.  That is unacceptable.  These are the issues we need to address.  Boundaries are not acceptable.  They should not prevent people from using the services they want just because they live in counties Kildare, Carlow or Laois.  I see it all the time and it is unacceptable.  That is something we need to fight on.  I will bring up the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, because it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I read in a report yesterday that people with disabilities were those hardest hit by the pandemic.  In this report, the National Advocacy Service and the Patient Advocacy Service detailed how people with disabilities were among those hardest hit by the impact of Covid and the associated health measures.  The study also outlined how people with disabilities felt marginalised when it came to decision-making.  That is a real issue for us.  We are not giving a chance to the people we need to have around the table making the decisions, such as Ms Kenny and Mr. O'Reilly.<\/p><p>We need to change policy and we need to make sure that the people affected are the ones who are sitting at the table.  They need to have input because they are the ones whose lives are affected.  It is not until your own life is affected that you can see these issues.<\/p><p> I welcome that Mr. O'Reilly mentioned Article 19 of the UNCRPD, which states that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to choose their place of residence, including community services, facilities and so on.  That is so important and it is a major issue we need to address.  I also compliment Mr. O'Reilly on lobbying his local council to get a motion passed.  It was so good to hear that he lobbied his local county council with a motion for the right to personal assistance services, which was passed unanimously at local level.  I compliment him on that.  We need to hear that he was doing so much great work.  We need to look at legislating to underpin the right to a personal assistant.  <\/p><p> Many of the questions I was going to ask have been asked.  I will ask Ms Kenny, as someone who knows the services and where they are failing, when we speak about boundaries, the HSE or services, where does she think the joined-up thinking could come from?  <\/p><p> Should Mr. O'Reilly look at submitting his motion to all 31 local authorities?  It is important.  I am passionate about this motion.  Will he let it go to all 31 local authorities?  Can we, as a committee, work with him to see what we could do to help with legislation?  <\/p><p> I thank the witnesses very much for their stories today.  It is not until you are in that position that you realise how affected families and children are by it.  It has an impact on all the family, including a mother, father, aunt and uncle.

Will they say a little about that?  It is no wonder Ms Kenny is getting emotional about this because I honestly do not know how she keeps going and where she gets her energy and power from.  It is the same for Mr. O'Reilly.  They have to constantly fight all the time for their basic needs.

It is just constant heartbreak and arguing for your rights.  Ms Kenny talked about the struggle to get adaptation grants.  I had to go through all that and it was another fight.

Now imagine being that parent, who has spent all that energy and put all that work in with a child, only to have to go to an agency and rip that child apart just to get a service.  That is what we have to do.  We spend all our time telling our children how they are able to do this and they just need to find a different way but to access a service, one has to list every single thing that society sees as wrong with one's child.  That is a very hard task.  The well-being of the family is massively affected.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of trying to future-proof.  I have a 16-year-old who came to me at 14 years of age and told me not to worry about what will happen to his sister when I die because he will take care of her.  He was 14 at the time he said that.  That came from nowhere because he overheard a conversation where we were trying to work out guardianship should anything happen to me and my husband.  We need to look at guardianship because we do not want our daughter to end up in residential care.  We bought a house intended for her and it is the house she should live in.  He overheard a conversation where we were trying to work out guardianship so at 14 years of age, he came in to me and stated \"you do not need to worry about my sister because if anything happens to you and Dad, I will take care of her.\".  A 14-year-old should never have to utter those words.<\/p> <p>  This affects the whole family.  He also told me not to worry about his two brothers because he will keep an eye on them as well, although they are fairly independent.  I am very lucky to have the children I have.  We do much work in our house on mental and emotional well-being because the system destroys us.  We fill in reams of paperwork where we literally write down everything that is wrong with our child.  We have to prove everything that has been written so we must take our child to these services and hope the child is having a bad day, because if she is not, we might not get the service.  There is added stress involved in keeping the service and hoping the child does not improve too much, which could lead to a loss of the services.  Imagine hoping your child does not improve too much so you can keep care services.  It is a horrible position and no parent wants to be in it.  No parent wants to be constantly thinking about every weak chink in the armour that is being built for a child but it is what we must do constantly, day after day.<\/p> <p>  What makes it even worse is there are no specialised mental health services for our family.  Any therapist services or counselling I have done came through word of mouth from somebody who had experience with this and would have known how to handle my situation.  This is so I do not find myself in a room with somebody who is so shocked by what I am saying they are unable to support me.  There are no sibling counselling services so my oldest child has not availed of any mental health counselling services.  There is none for him.<\/p> <p>  To get counselling services outside the private system, one must jump through the current hoops.  A medical card holder gets six free sessions and must wait for them.  It is a six-month wait to access those sessions.  After those six free sessions, one must wait another year to access six free sessions.  There are no dedicated mental health services for families like ours.  I may sound ungrateful but in our position, six free sessions do not even scratch the surface.  We cannot do enough work in six free sessions to ensure everything is okay.  Mental health services must be looked at in conjunction with disability services.<\/p> <p>  Many reports have been published on this.  Family carers, caregivers and people with disabilities all suffer with their mental health simply because they constantly have to fight to access services.  Even if we fix the services, there is a group of people who have been traumatised by having to fight for those services and prove they are worthy of them.  Imagine having to prove you are worthy enough to access basic care.  It is what we have to do.  We must prove we are worthy enough to access basic care.<\/p> <p>  That is my perspective on our well-being or how we are trying to manage our well-being.  I hope it helps to answer the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly and Ms Kenny for their forthrightness this morning, which has been a revelation.  Sadly, since I got into national politics, which is coming up to six years ago now, I have dealt with similar cases on a weekly basis in my constituency office.  The first time I sat on this committee I said there are things going on that we should not be proud of as politicians and we must start putting them right.<\/p> <p>  I do not have too many questions because we have heard much from the witnesses.  At this stage the housing adaptation grants from local authorities are not fit for purpose relative to the cost of doing work, taking into account the gap between getting the work done and getting paid.  There is also a shortfall that puts a financial burden on families.  The flat adaptation grant must be tailored specifically for the needs of the household at the time.  That is instead of a block grant for doing something, with the threshold decided by the local authority and which has no real bearing on the overall cost.<\/p> <p>  Children need early intervention and assessments and the process is a struggle from start to finish.  Once assessments are done, parents must continue to prove disabilities year on year or time and again if they are seeking additional service or when there is a review of services.  I have told before of a case of a child who is blind since birth.  The parents of that child must prove that blindness all the time and as Ms Kenny has said, they must bare their sole in laying everything out time and again to prove the child is worthy of the service.  That is demoralising or even worse.<\/p> <p>  There were statements about the carer's allowance.  I understand the point is that if wages or income in the family increase, the threshold for the allowance is not increasing in line with it.  There are 13 years of a static carer's allowance threshold but with inflation or whatever, wages are going up, meaning people can find themselves out of the net fairly fast.  It is something we must look at and I see it with medical cards.  If a social welfare payment increases by a fiver per week, sometimes people can fall out of the net and lose that medical card because of that fiver of an increase in the old age pension or other social welfare payment.<\/p> <p>  There is much for us to consider.  Ms Kenny mentioned counselling services for the wider family.  On this committee we have an opportunity and responsibility to take what the witnesses have told us and to bring into effect the required changes.  Those changes require funding and we cannot hedge around this just by preparing strategies.  We must ensure we provide the necessary funding for consultants, psychologists and teams in place.<\/p><p>We must also ensure we have cover when people go on holidays or maternity leave so a gap is not left to be filled after somebody has left.  It is criminal that we have a system like that and that we do not do a bit of pre-planning to make sure a seamless service is available through the year.  That takes money, time, management and accountability.<\/p><p> I assure both witnesses we will work closely as a committee.  What we have been told today has been of immense value to me and I thank the witnesses for that.  We will try to help the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to extract more funding to ensure what we need to do will be done and properly funded.  We have to legislate to make sure human rights are protected.  That is what it is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#K00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for taking the time to share their experiences with us.  I cannot imagine how exhausting it must be to tell another group of people about them but the insight they give us is invaluable as we try to improve the State's adherence to the UN convention.  I do not think there are any words to convey the fortitude the witnesses have had to show to access services that should be automatically provided as a bare minimum.<\/p> <p>  Many of the important questions have been asked but I have one question for each witness.  Mr. O'Reilly's explanation of the difference between PA and carer was useful.  The PA model, whereby the person with the disability is the leader, seems like one we should aspire to for as many people as possible, where appropriate.  Is this the model Mr. O'Reilly thinks we should invest in more to ensure people become as independent as possible?  Should it be the default model rather than the outlier?<\/p> <p>  Senator Black asked Ms Kenny the question I wanted to focus on but I will ask an additional one.  As a rural Deputy, her description of the lack of accessible public transport is familiar.  She discussed the fundraising she was forced to carry out to get a suitable vehicle for her daughter.  It is disgraceful that she had to do that.  It shows the generosity of communities and where the State fails.  We always see communities, individuals and families filling the gaps where the State fails to provide services and infrastructure.

With a PA service, it is a completely different dynamic to a carer or home care service or support.  You can attend appointments, get a job and go to college.  Overall, there is more independence.  The PA service will work better because it works under the social model as opposed to home care support, which works under the medical model and the service is restrictive.  Every day I would have to bear in mind health and safety and what I can and cannot do but for everyday things the agencies are restrictive in the tasks they can perform.  The administrative costs of obtaining an agency are also quite high.  The PA service under the social model is the way forward.

We live 6 km from our local town on a busy main road in rural Ireland.  We are not far from the county.  We are in south Kildare.  It is not like living in Mayo; it is what people would still class as civilisation.  To leave the house, Ava has to get in her van.  That is the only way she can leave the house.  We cannot go out for a walk because the road is too busy.  The nearest bus stop is about 700 m away but we cannot walk to it and, if we do, she cannot get on the bus because it is a minibus with steps.  If we want to access public transport, we have to drive 6 km for accessible public transport.  When we drive those 6 km, we have an unmanned railway station so we have to give notice to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to make sure we can get on a train.  If we want to go with the intercity coach, we cannot get on it because it is by steps.  Ava's wheelchair does not fold and she cannot walk.  The local town link bus is the only accessible form of public transport in our area that is manned.<\/p> <p>  We literally cannot survive without our accessible vehicle.  The reason we had to raise funds for it was that Ava had to change wheelchair and the wheelchair she changed to could not be folded and was too heavy to lift in and out of a car.  They withheld the wheelchair from me until I got accessible transport because it was a health and safety risk that I could not get it in and out of the car.  They could not give it to me because I would hurt myself.  We had to raise funds because we could not get a loan.  We tried to get loans in the past and could not.  We did not even raise funds for a new van - we got a second-hand one.<\/p> <p>  The scheme in place for wheelchair-accessible vehicles is not accessible for the average family.  The scheme, to my understanding, is designed so you can change your vehicle every few years and not have to worry about breakdowns and things.  The only way to do that without paying a substantial amount of money to upgrade the vehicle is to buy new. <\/p> <p>  We were recently quoted for a new van.  We are looking at &euro;32,000 for the van and &euro;20,000 for adaptation.  That is &euro;52,000 for a wheelchair-accessible van, with VRT and VAT removed.  That is after they have taken the scheme.  If we went down that route, we have been told that in two years' time we can trade it in and might only have to pay a few thousand euro to upgrade to a new one.  That is the scheme we have.  It is not accessible so people are buying second-hand vehicles that they are keeping on the road as long as they can, getting loans they have to pay back or depending on family again.<\/p> <p>  Wheelchair-accessible vehicles are not optional extras for many families like ours.  We rely on them to get around in our day-to-day life.  Our daughter cannot leave the house without one.  Most are diesel or petrol models.  There is no electric alternative.  With the new measures in place, in ten years' time we will struggle to find a van because there is no provision for us in the new green measures.  We are trying to stop diesels being produced.  Currently there is one electric model being provided by a single dealer.  I do not have the heart even to ask how much it will cost.  I know I will never be able to afford it.  We have the worry hanging over our head that in eight years' time we may not be able to buy a new van if there are no second-hand vans around because they are not being produced anymore.  On top of that, we are being hit with a carbon tax measure when it hits diesel because we all drive diesel and petrol vans.  That goes to the end user again and that is our only form of transport for all our families, which was not taken into account.<\/p><p>Public transport does not exist for us.  The accessible vehicle scheme is not working and is dependent on the dealer.  It is a retrospective grant as well, so a person must have the money to pay up front and then claim back the tax.  There is a waiting time to get the money back again.  It does not feel like a great deal of thought was put into the scheme.  It feels like a box-ticking exercise so that people can say they thought about us because they put this scheme in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Reilly and Ms Kenny.  I cannot say I enjoyed their testimony because it was heartbreaking.  Incredible and powerful advocates are again appearing before us, for which I thank them.  They have laid the hard truths out in front of us.  We all encounter these cases in our constituencies, with people coming to our offices and talking to us, but it was powerful to hear today's testimonies and important to have them on the record.<\/p> <p>  When I was a member of Louth County Council, I was glad to propose the PA services motion and get it passed.  I worked with many Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues from around the country on ensuring that the motion was passed in the final few counties.  I believe that all county councils have now passed it, although we still need to hear back from a few on whether that is the case.  It is important that they pass it.<\/p> <p>  I do not have questions, but I will make a few points following on from the testimonies and conversations.  This is a struggle.  People with disabilities are constantly fighting.  It is soul destroying.  That is what the services are doing to them and their families.  I ask the Chairman for some action to come from today's meeting, particularly in respect of PA services.  Could we get an official from the HSE to appear before us to discuss why PA services are not regulated, why there is a different system in each CHO area and why it is down to each disability manager to design a service?  The service is not working efficiently or effectively for people.  It would be important to have a HSE manager of whom we could ask these questions appear before us.  I am glad to see that more money has been made available in this budget.  We need to ensure that it is used for actual PA services and not, as Mr. O'Reilly mentioned, administration.  The latter cannot be allowed to happen.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability fought hard to get extra money for PA services in her budget.<\/p> <p>  Turning to a second action, we might also have a HSE manager appear before us to discuss why the system is so inflexible.  Ms Kenny referred to a ten-minute journey versus a 30-minute one for her children to go to school.  That is ludicrous.  There is an inflexible \"computer says no\" attitude, but we are not dealing with computers.  We are dealing with humans, and our citizens who use and require these services deserve flexibility.  This committee has heard testimony every week about our rigid system.  We need to start questioning the people who deliver the services, namely, the HSE.<\/p> <p>  If Mr. O'Reilly or Ms Kenny have comments to make on my suggestions, I would appreciate hearing their thoughts.  I have learned a great deal this morning and I thank them for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#M00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>We will go to Mr. O'Reilly and Ms Kenny for closing remarks and responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#M00300","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Plus, it is being put through organisations in a system that is still under the medical model.  It would be great if the first action was taken and the committee consulted the HSE.

The HSE needs to be asked.  From our experience, there is a massive over-reliance on charities and NGOs to provide services that the HSE lacks.  That is not right.  We depend on a charity for nursing hours.  Personally, we are ageing out of that charity.  I have no idea who will provide my nursing care.  I am not getting any feedback from anyone.  It is &quot;computer says no&quot; or there is no one there from whom to get a response.  I am not alone in this - it is a common issue for families in similar situations.<br\/><br\/>Something else I might ask to be raised is the <i>loco parentis<\/i>rule in terms of nursing care.  Under it, nursing care is provided but there has to be another adult in the house with the child.  This basically means that nursing care is provided but the parent is not given time away.  What is the point in having the nursing care if the parent cannot leave to do what he or she needs to do and that cannot be done when the child is with the parent?  This rule needs to be reviewed, although I know it was reviewed previously.  Nursing care has been referred to as support rather than respite.  Nursing care is support - it is not respite.  It is not that we want time off.  Rather, we need space to go to a bank.  Otherwise, we have to drag our child with a wheelchair into and out of a car and through an inaccessible building just to lodge money.  It is not that we want time off to go to the cinema and have a meal.  Rather, we use those hours to do basic things like take a sibling to a swimming lesson.  I cannot do that if I have to stay in the building with a nurse.  If I do not stay, then other family members have to.  What is the point in having a nurse if a family member has to stay with the nurse?  This rule needs to be examined.  It is not support if we have to stay there.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for giving me the time to have my say and put my point across on the issues we have raised today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021102100002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Samantha Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly and Ms Kenny for their contributions.

They showed courage in putting their personal stories on the public record and did so with dignity, passion and succinctness.  Their evidence this morning has been about their voices not being heard, there being hoops to jump through and boxes to tick, the advocate and the mother.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given and should respect directions given by the Chairperson of the committee to the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech which might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.

Practically every family is affected in some way by the imprint of this disease.  A core foundation for our current mission to establish a fully integrated approach to cancer research, was the All-Ireland Cancer Consortium, AICC, which arose as a tangible output of the Good Friday Agreement.  This tripartite cancer research and training agreement between the Departments of Health of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US National Cancer Institute - one of the premier cancer institutes in the world - was first signed at Government Buildings Stormont in October 1999.  <\/p> <p>  This groundbreaking agreement was recently re-invigorated on 16 March this year in the form of a revised memorandum of understanding which was signed by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, Department of Health; the Minister, Robin Swann MLA, Department of Health, Northern Ireland; and Dr. Norman Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute.  This historic occasion for cancer patients, cancer research and cancer care on the island of Ireland saw statements of support from: An Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin; former First Minister, Arlene Foster MLA; Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill MLA; and Mr. Norris Cochrane, former Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services.<\/p> <p>  In his St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day meeting with the Taoiseach, US President Biden expressed his renewed commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and referred to this consortium and how all parties could learn from one another and improve outcomes for cancer patients.  The impact of this cross-Border and transatlantic collaboration has been very substantial.  An evaluation of the consortium&rsquo;s activities over the past 21 years found that this partnership significantly increased both the quality and quantity of research across the island of Ireland, contributed to saving thousands of lives and enhanced the quality of life of cancer survivors.  <\/p> <p>  Among many of these achievements have been the establishment of a cancer clinical trials infrastructure for the island, a cancer prevention fellowship programme, and an All-Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care.  <\/p> <p>  Building on this success, our aim now is to establish an all-island cancer research institute, AICRI.  This will be a virtual institute, focusing on bringing together cancer researchers across the island, from the laboratory bench to the hospital setting in an integrated, team-based approach.  We are currently putting together an ambitious, comprehensive and cross-cutting cancer research programme involving multiple stakeholders.  These stakeholders include academic, clinical and industry partners, as well as patients, funders and government agencies.<\/p> <p>  Ten academic institutions have agreed to partner to fulfil the AICRI vision.  Representatives from these institutions, along with patient advocates from both jurisdictions, are members of the AICRI steering committee, which was established in February 2021.  They are joined by the director of the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme and the CEO of Cancer Trials Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  AICRI will focus on four key themes, covering cancer prevention,diagnostics and treatment, and survivorship-quality of life.  <\/p> <p>  A wide range of cutting-edge projects relating to these thematic areas has already been garnered from the cancer research community across the island.  Our role within AICRI is to work towards integrating these plans into a common research framework which will best deliver for cancer patients, while also helping to drive economic and social benefit.<\/p><p>Cancer patients treated in research-active hospitals, particularly those with strong academic links, have better outcomes than those who are not.  Embedding of research within the national cancer control programme for Ireland and the Northern Ireland cancer strategy is critical to ensuring optimal care for our citizens.  Focusing on cancer is particularly relevant in the context of Covid-19 because our work has shown the adverse impact that the pandemic can have on cancer services and cancer patients on this island unless we act rapidly and decisively.<\/p><p> AICRI directly addresses a critical need identified within Ireland's national cancer strategy 2017-2026, which acknowledges a current absence of an overarching framework for cancer research.  It also acknowledges that it is vital to ensure that research is a strong component of cancer services.  AICRI's activities are also well aligned to the draft cancer strategy for Northern Ireland 2021-2031, which has been identified as an immediate priority of the Northern Ireland Executive.<\/p><p> In addition to clear benefits to the healthcare system, both in the short and long term, AICRI will also greatly assist further development of a cross-border ecosystem for innovation.  It will provide new discoveries and talent for the burgeoning indigenous biotechnology industry in both Ireland and Northern Ireland while also acting as a gravitational hub to retain and attract large-scale pharma and allied companies.<\/p><p> We greatly welcome the recent approval from the North-South Ministerial Council for the new PEACE PLUS programme for the period 2021 to 2027, which will provide critical funding to support cross-Border projects in key areas directly aligned to AICRI, such as research and development and healthcare intervention trials.  Moreover, we are excited by the opportunities afforded by the new HEA North-South research programme call 2021.  We are preparing a submission under this call to create an all-island interdisciplinary training programme for emerging cancer researchers in the areas of cancer prevention, diagnostics and treatment.  During a keynote address in September 2017 at an International Cooperation in the Fight Against Cancer event in Dublin, then Vice-President Biden said \"every day, every minute matters to patients and we must bring that sense of urgency to our cancer research and care systems.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Would any of Professor Gallagher's colleagues like to make any comments?

Bill Dahut, who is the clinical director of the National Cancer Institute in Washington, which is one of the best cancer institutes in the world, based on what Professor Gallagher's presentation about the activities that came out of the Good Friday Agreement, has now said that Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of that and are embedded within the global cancer research map.  We want to build on that and go to the next level.  This is why we were working together.  Cancer does not know any borders so we should not know borders either.

I am from County Monaghan in the Border region, so this means a lot to me.  Having gone to college in the North and lived in Dublin, I know the importance of working together on this island.  We have a long history of working together on this island when it comes to cancer.  For 20 years, clinicians on this island, and Professor Lowery could talk to this as well, have worked on cancer trials in particular.  Very often, people do not really know what means.  I represent Cancer Trials Ireland, which is opening clinical trials in hospitals across the Border because, as Professor Lawler said, cancer has no borders.  We are giving patients opportunities to access treatments, innovations, devices and radiotherapy within a hospital environment.  One might say \"So what?  What does that mean?\"  It changes the conversation between the oncologist and the patient from \"There is nothing more I can do.  Go and sort out your affairs\" to \"We have an opportunity here for a clinical trial\".  That is the reality of clinical trials.  Under the cancer strategy, we have a target of 6% in the Republic of Ireland.  To do that, we need to do more and we need more investment.  That is why we are here today.  Northern Ireland is in exactly the same position.  We have a great tradition of working from a patient perspective where patient advocates have worked together North and South on how best patients can be involved in these decisions around their treatment and as scientists.  I came in today wearing the US-Ireland badge.  Professor Patrick Johnson from Queen's University Belfast had a huge part to play in the memorandum of understanding that was signed.  He made the Good Friday Agreement about cancer.  When it was signed, the National Cancer Institute did something amazing.  The US trained our investigators and clinicians to do more, so even though we do not have enough medical oncologists in Ireland - we have 40 where we should have about 80 - a lot of them have been trained in the US and a lot of them bring that dimension to our hospitals North and South so I think there is significant scope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>My colleagues outlined many of the big issues we want to discuss.

Our patients face a greater threat than Covid-19 every day.  What we have seen over the past year was what research has done in terms of transforming the world when it came to dealing with Covid - vaccines that mean we can sit here today.  We cannot yet provide that level of hope for our patients and patients facing a diagnosis of advanced cancer or recalcitrant cancer.  We cannot yet expedite the new treatments in the way we have done for Covid-19.  We are hoping to provide that drive and hope towards really prioritising cancer.  Research provides that innovation and drive for us to do better for our patients.  Cancer is a great equaliser.  It knows no borders, as Professor Lawler noted.  Trials constitute the best way of getting new treatments to patients.

We have done a study with Professor Lawler, which was published last year, on the number of patients, and we reckon that 30,000 have accessed clinical trials on the island.  Cancer Trials Ireland would not exist if this commitment had not been made 20 years ago.  Primarily, it started with some oncologists who had been trained in the US and through the National Cancer Institute, NCI, coming together to run trials.  It then progressed to getting support from key stakeholders, like the Government through the Health Research Board, and key fundraising organisations, like the Irish Cancer Society, and it has evolved since then.  We are a not-for-profit organisation so we are not an institute, and it works.<\/p> <p>  The irony in sitting here today is that the very first radiotherapy trials started in this building, in the basement of Leinster House, in 1914.  The scientists involved included Dr. Stevenson and a scientist from Offaly, Professor John Joly.  The way they did the trials ended up being utilised by Marie Curie, so we have form in Ireland in terms of our ability to work together and to drive new research questions.<\/p> <p>  Some of our oncologists have been published and recognised internationally at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, conference, which is the global oncology conference that happens every year, where new treatments are announced and new findings are developed, and treatment regimes change in the clinic as a result of that.  That is pretty incredible.  One of our colleagues, Professor John Reynolds, led a trial in Europe which was sponsored by Cancer Trials Ireland.  We opened sites across Europe in that trial and it was published at the ASCO conference this year.  We have a great history of success in cancer trials in Ireland and there is much more to come.<\/p> <p>  We need more investment and more infrastructure in the space but, despite that, we have managed to do it.  Our numbers have been affected by Covid but our need is also going to be affected by Covid because there will be a greater need for cancer trials and cancer research in this space.  I will pass over to my colleagues to continue from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I want to explain the process.  Cancer trials are a patient-focused component but it is key also that we again resource sufficiently the discovery element, an example being the use of RNA vaccines in the treatment of Covid.  That company was actually focused on using the technology for cancer vaccines.  What is odd about it is that it has really accelerated because of the utility in the context of the treatment of Covid but a really big interest has now gone back towards trying to look at the efficacy of these types of approaches in treating cancer.  However, the foundation is discovery.  We have to have something to bring forward into the clinic.  It is critical that we have that continuum within cancer research across the island - the ability to find new things, take those from the laboratory bench and bring them towards the clinic.  That process is called translational research, where we try to translate our discoveries.<\/p> <p>  We have some very good examples of programmes.  When we are talking about AICRI, it is a virtual project, not a bricks and mortar project; it is about people coming together in a team-based approach.  We have good examples of that happening already and showing efficacy.  For example, I had the pleasure for six years of leading a programme called BREAST-PREDICT, which was funded wholly by the Irish Cancer Society to the tune of &euro;7.5 million over the six years.  This programme had a big impact in terms of new discoveries in the breast cancer space.  It funded a team of just over 30 people between Cork, Dublin and Galway, and also had connections in Northern Ireland and with Cancer Trials Ireland.  I will give a couple of examples of specific outcomes.  Professor Bryan Hennessy, who is based in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and in Beaumont Hospital, had a specific interest in trying to understand why certain breast cancer patients may have an initial response to treatment but then develop a resistance over time.  He had uncovered a new idea about how that occurred and then had to come up with a new drug combination strategy from the laboratory bench, and he was able to transition this in Ireland in a first-of-its-kind study worldwide.  That is an example of true translational research or foundational research, where we come up with discoveries and bring them forward into the clinic.  Having that continuum is critical.<\/p> <p>  There is another concrete example which leads into the economic question.  There is a well-known assay or test in early-stage breast cancer which is called Oncotype DX.  With early-stage breast cancer, while it is great that mammographic screening is catching the breast cancer much earlier, the challenge then is that we potentially might over-treat patients with chemotherapy and it is a clinical dilemma with which patients and clinicians are faced.  If we have information to predict whether the disease is going to progress, we can have a decision as to whether to get chemotherapy.  The Oncotype DX test was approved for public patients in Ireland in 2011 and this was the first country in Europe where patients within the public healthcare system got access to that technology.  Why was that the case?  It was because Irish clinicians were really at the forefront of bringing forward that technology and validating it.<\/p> <p>  The world's biggest clinical trial was called the TAILORx trial.  The hospitals within the Irish context that participated in the trial, out of 900 hospitals worldwide, were some of the world's biggest accrual centres.  For example, St. Vincent's University Hospital was second out of 900 across the world.  Even though we are a small country between the two jurisdictions, we punch above our weight.<\/p> <p>  What is critical is not just advances in terms of clinical decisions but it is has been demonstrated that it actually saves money.  For example, because we are sparing patients from chemotherapy and the debilitating effects of chemotherapy when they may not stand to benefit, that actually saves the Exchequer money.  The first cost-effectiveness analysis studies were performed on patients within the Irish system.  Professor Lawler might want to tackle the economics question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  It is good to see her again.  I want to emphasise the critical importance of research.  In case anybody has any doubts, research is not an add-on any more.  Research is an integral part of how we deliver the best care for our patients.<\/p><p>That is why the past 20 years have been so important.  It has embedded that research culture on the island of Ireland.  The study we published last year in the <i>European Journal of Cancer<\/i>showed that we doubled the amount of research we were doing together.  We also significantly increased the amount of research we were doing with experts in the US.  The quality of the research we did was also brought up to a great degree.  That is compared to those that are much bigger than us around the world.  As Professor Gallagher said, we punch above our weight.<br\/><br\/>I will give one good example of the economic-commercial aspect of it - Mr. Briscoe will give another - that comes from a company called Almac Diagnostic Services.  It started as a spin-out company from Queen's University Belfast based on work and research done in the laboratory, initially on bowel cancer, that identified a particular test that could be used to identify which bowel cancer patients would best respond to particular treatments.  That then spun out of the university, partly with Almac, a company within Northern Ireland involved in drug delivery and development, and became Almac Diagnostic Services.  It is now the second biggest molecular diagnostics company in Europe.  That is what is we can do based on the science and talent on this island.  <br\/><br\/>Would it not be great if we could bring together the best minds and talents on this island to tackle the biggest challenge we face and will face in the future?  Cancer is the biggest killer in this country, and on this island, and the Covid pandemic means it will be a big problem as we go forward.  We need to act now in order to address this issue.  That is why it is the combination of four groups working together in unity, namely, patients, clinicians, researchers and industry, that will drive better care for our patients and economic and societal benefit for our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Lawler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>For the benefit of members, there are approximately four minutes left in this slot but that is no problem.

One of the challenges is the scaling of those entities and bringing them to that next level.  Commonly, they are acquired by some third party in the US and do not really develop within an Irish context so those jobs are lost in Ireland, in a sense, or there is no potential for them to grow.  We need to change that.  We need to create a proper ecosystem where people and talent are retained within Ireland such that these can grow and flourish.  That is critical.<\/p> <p>  We have some excellent examples of people who are at the forefront.  For example, a company called Carrick Therapeutics spans Dublin and Oxford.  A couple of years ago, it got the highest amount of series A funding for any kind of new company.  The first seed investment in the company was close to $100 million.  That company, which has bases in Ireland and Oxford, has now just completed clinical trials that are the first in-person studies for its agent.  The challenge for that type of company is how it goes to that next level, such as the new Almac.  We want to create more Almac entities within an Irish context.  We have to have that system and the people on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  I am fortunate to be deputy director of a programme called Precision Oncology Ireland, which is one way we are addressing that issue at the moment.  It is half-funded by Science Foundation Ireland and half by the industry sector that, importantly, includes six cancer charities in Ireland.  It is unprecedented that six cancer charities came together.  This is a strategic research partnership in the order of &euro;12 million for a five-year research programme.  I will give one concrete example of a North-South project that came out of that, which is a collaboration between Professor Tracy Robson in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, who is an expert in cancer biology, and a spin-out from Queen's called pHion Therapeutics, which developed really sophisticated and cool ways of delivering drugs.

We produced a DKM report in 2016 that we shared with this committee.  It showed that within the clinic, when you organise a clinical trial your hospital does not have to pay for the treatments involved in it.  That is very often taken on by the sponsor of the clinical trial, especially when it is a pharmaceutical sponsor.  In 2016, there were cost savings of &euro;16 million within the HSE's drugs budget.  That was just for drugs that were available within the system at the time.  It did not include all the advanced innovative therapies that were also being provided through our trials because that is not perceived as a saving.  Some &euro;16.5 million in GDP cost savings and 250 jobs were within the ecosystem at the time.  I believe that has grown and we need to do a further analysis.  We talked to people about that only yesterday.<\/p> <p>  One of the things InterTradeIreland did in 2014 was to commission its own study.  That is how we met.  It was in the context of a commission to study and identify clinical trial clusters as an area of interest for cross-Border collaboration.  We met and discussed the idea of targeting cancer and we were able to show the data we had from the DKM report.  InterTradeIreland has been very important to us in building bridges, talking to one another and getting that US-Ireland collaboration going again in addition to the memorandum of understanding, MOU.  As you are all sitting in on this call on both sides of the Border listening to us talk about specific trials, such as the TAILORx trial and Professor Reynolds's Neo-AEGIS oesophageal trial I talked about earlier, it should be borne in mind that all those trials opened on both sides of the Border.  In fact, we sponsored some of them to open in the UK.  We had patients in Belfast City Hospital, Dublin and Cork.  As Professor Gallagher pointed out about the TAILORx trial, we approved, which means recruited, large numbers of patients to that trial.  Belfast was one of the top recruiters for the Neo-AEGIS study so it just shows there is major capability on both sides of the Border.  I thought I should mention that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>We will move to the Fine Gael slot.

My questions are probably more about prompting them to share more rather than being prescriptive.<\/p> <p>  This engagement is a major reminder that the biggest killer we face is cancer and non-cardiovascular disease.  Over the past 18 months, Covid has shown us what we can do and what we can achieve.  I am fully behind a fully integrated approach to cancer research in addition to, as the witnesses have outlined and written about, the research culture, a common research framework attracting key industries to Ireland on an all-island basis and what they describe as the birth of a new biotech industry, which are all very interesting and are part of this ecosystem of innovation we should be very much behind.<\/p> <p>  The revised memorandum of understanding probably did not get as much attention as it should have just because Covid has dominated so much.  It shows the power of that transatlantic relationship and of working together on an island.

We have done a lot of work in the United Kingdom and we were the first to show the impact of Covid-19 on cancer services and cancer research.  Unfortunately, that has been the reality.  However, it has allowed us to work on an all-island basis in relation to Covid and cancer.  I agree with the Senator that we should have worked on Covid to a greater extent on an all-island basis but certainly we have done so with cancer.<\/p> <p>  The work we did initially looked at what happened in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  We have been working with the faculty of pathology in Dublin and pathologists and oncologists around the country through six different organisations.  We are pulling together a report that will come out in December.  We would be very happy to invite members of the committee to the launch.  This will show the importance of data.  Having that data intelligence allows us not only to identify what the challenges and problems are but, much more importantly, it points the way in relation to solutions.  We have developed a seven-point plan to mitigate the impact of Covid on cancer.  That is very important.  Data help us to identify the problem, because we need to know what the problem is and the scale of the problem, and the data also drive how we actually solve the problem.  While we must identify the challenges, we are much more into driving what the solutions are.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's second question was on research-active hospitals, which are something I am very passionate about.  Last year, we did work with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer to look at this.  I am a bit of a data geek, and I make no apologies for that.  One of the aspects we wanted to look at was if there was evidence that tells us that people who are treated in research-active hospitals have better outcomes than those which are not.  We found that it to be the case, which puts to bed forever the myth that cancer research is a little add-on and something that people do in ivory towers.  Cancer research is an integral part of how we deliver modern cancer care.  I am sure Professor Lowery will address that because she is right at the coalface of delivering cancer care.  We would not be anywhere in our fight against Covid without science and the same applies with cancer.<\/p> <p>  The Cancer Moonshot is a US initiative that goes back to John F. Kennedy's shooting for the moon programme.  Essentially, it is a co-ordinated approach looking at bringing together the best minds in the US to address cancer.  President Biden was the champion of this when he was Vice President and he continues to be a champion.  On his second day in office, President Biden held a virtual call with the National Cancer Institute.  That is how important he believes it to be.  I am asking why we cannot have an all-island cancer moonshot.  We have the people, the skill set and the opportunity to bring together people across this island.  That, alongside collaborations with the National Cancer Institute in the US, would, I suggest, make us unbeatable.  This is the type of challenge we want to address because this is how we are going to deliver for our patients. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Lawler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>It may also be interesting to discuss the fast-tracking of innovation and how we do that, which we referred to earlier, and perhaps the context of protected time for research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I am glad to hear the outcome for Senator Currie's mum, which is wonderful.  It is lovely to hear about the good stories.  We do not hear enough of that.<\/p> <p>  When we say that patients do best in research-active hospitals, we must understand what cancer research really means on an individual patient basis.  Sometimes people think that cancer research is somebody in a laboratory growing cells and so on, and a large part of it is this basic research.  However, what it really means for implementing change in cancer care is that we are using research to address key barriers and problems that we identify in the care of our patients.  That is not just new treatments.  It is also how a person recovers better from a very difficult surgery, what kinds of psychosocial care we need to provide to a particular demographic or subgroup of patients to make sure they can identify the symptoms of their cancer and attend for treatment in a timely way and what supports a person needs to live with and beyond cancer and how does that differ depending on where they live, their age, what cancer it is and what surgery they have had.  There are so many questions that arise when we map the clinical care pathways for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancers that can be solved quicker and better through innovative and focused cancer research.  A key part of that is that we do not work in silos.  For example, I can work with somebody like Professor Gallagher, go to somebody like Ms Mulroe or chat to Professor Lawler.  I could, for example, talk about our patients with oesophageal cancer who are undergoing this huge surgery.  It is very hard to get them back out into the community, living lives where they can enjoy good quality of life after the treatment of their cancer.  I can ask my colleagues how we can innovate together to figure out what that looks like, how we can measure the extent of the problem with data and how we can share the information we have gained to address that problem together.  This is how we move the field forward.<\/p> <p>  With Covid, that research happened very quickly.  That is what needs to happen in cancer research.  The important thing about Covid-19 research is that everybody came together very quickly.  Traditionally in research in every country, we tend to compete for funds or attention across our academic institutions and hospitals, or personally.  To drive forward patient care, it is better when we are working collaboratively together rather than in silos.  This applies across disciplines, institutions and borders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Maeve Lowery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I will try to cover the Senator's question on other aspects of healthcare.  One of the interesting aspects we are trying to do within the proposed all-island cancer research institute is a cancer research programme, but people do not just present with a cancer-related issue.  Commonly, patients have comorbidities.  Often, it is an interesting concept of what is the impact of those comorbidities on the cancer and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We know, for example, that one of the biggest new emerging treatment options in cancer is immunotherapy.  There is work from a very strong investigator in Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Lydia Lynch, who is a joint appointment between Harvard and Trinity College.  Dr. Lynch is a world leader in looking at the impact of immune cells in the context of the obesity and cancer.<\/p><p>This may have an impact in respect of therapeutic response.  Dr. Lynch is a fundamental biologist trying to explore that.  She collaborates with a colleague of mine, Professor Donal Brennan, who works in the clinic in the context of gynaecological cancers, trying to translate this type of information in the context of cancer care.  It is a matter of joining the dots of the people with the expertise, in either clinical or basic science, facilitating that interconnection and funding the research programmes.  This is not just a talking shop; it is an actual activity.  It has to be brought forward.  It takes hard graft and resources to do it, but we are primed in an Irish context to do that.  We are naturally able to interact with one another but we have to resource this properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.  I thank Senator Currie for raising the issue of talent.  She asked about the gap that is there.  I talked about the fact that we had only 40 medical oncologists when we need 80.  It is probably the same with radiation oncology, haematology and surgery, all the disciplines involved in cancer research.  Attracting people in is a challenge throughout medicine.  We have heard about it a lot.  People will be attracted into this country if what Professor Gallagher, Professor Lawler and Professor Lowery have talked about is provided, namely, a research-rich environment.  The people at the top of their game in medical oncology want to work in a research-rich hospital.  We have had rows of our graduates go abroad and work in amazing cancer research institutes in the US, Australia and Canada and they have not all come home.  They have that capability and knowledge.  Let us look at that and at training.  Let us pick the low-hanging fruit and look at developing that relationship with the National Cancer Institute.  Professor Lawler and I were on the phone to the institute the day after Ned Sharpless spoke to President Biden.  We are Irish on this island.  We have the ability to network.  It is in our DNA.<\/p> <p>  I think about some of the trials we are running.  We have investigators on one prostate cancer trial which is run by a group called the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group, ANZUP.  We are opening the trial in Ireland and the UK, including in Belfast.  The investigators, that is, the doctors, are in Harvard, Canada and Australia.  Two of our investigators, Professor Ray McDermott and Dr. Paul Kelly, have trained and worked with these people when they were placed in other hospitals abroad.  It is that network.  We are really good in cancer research at bringing that knowledge home for the benefit of the people here and our patients.  That is really important to say.  We were asked why we have done so well so far.  The one thing about the cancer community is that its members work together.  It is a grassroots movement in a way among cancer researchers and oncologists.  You cannot just create that or fund that.  It naturally happens within this space.  We are here today all representing different organisations.  There are ten institutions behind this all-island collaboration that we are here to discuss.  That in itself says a lot, and not every country can replicate what we are doing here in cancer research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>That is the 15-minute slot filled.

It certainly highlights the urgency of dealing with cancer, and it is good to see the collaboration that is happening across the island of Ireland.  That augurs well for the future.  My first question is about the understanding of what this work is about and the ordinary person's access to that understanding through the provision of information on the research that is going on.  The other issue is the linking of all the hospitals and institutions into the research and development of the strategy on this.  Also, we hear a lot about collections and attempts to raise funds for cancer research.  Like anything else, once that goes on for so long, people forget about it and move to the next popular charity or whatever the case may be.  If more information were put out to the public as to what research is happening and what developments within that research and what new mechanisms and treatments are being found, maybe it would encourage again an uptake of the funding for cancer research.  I think people very often wonder where that funding goes and what happens to it.  Furthermore, how do we stop these developments becoming the ownership of a particular company?  How do we make this more accessible to the general public in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francie Molloy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I will take the first question.  It is critical to have appropriate public and patient involvement.  It is becoming increasingly important.  To a certain degree, in the past, scientific research, certainly the kind of research I do in a laboratory setting, was not very patient-facing and we did not really interact that heavily.  Obviously, the kind of research Professor Lowery was doing, because that was with a patient, is closer to the person.  That has changed over recent years.  I will give a good example driven by a colleague of mine, Professor Amanda McCann in UCD.  This whole initiative started with a conversation that Mr. Briscoe and I had at a meeting called The Patient Voice in Cancer Research about three years ago.  This initiative was essentially an idea whereby we gather together researchers and a group of patients with a lived experience of cancer.  In that case, these were researchers who would not normally interact with patients.  This was done to have a two-way dialogue.  We have been going through this evolution over a number of years as to how we appropriately communicate our research and understand patient needs.  It is a matter of having that conversation and two-way dialogue.  I will give the committee a link to the YouTube video so members can watch it later.  Margaret Grayson, who is also on our committee, is a very strong patient advocate who has been at the centre of a lot of driving forward of cancer research programmes.  It is critical we have that.<\/p> <p>  That is at the patient level, but I think part of Mr. Molloy's question was about wider public engagement.  That is important, not just for cancer research but for awareness of science in general.  People now know what PCR, antigen tests and sequencing are, for example.  That is what we do on a day-to-day basis in cancer research.  The foundations of those technologies are in cancer research.  The technology for the Human Genome Project started in cancer research labs.  That conversation about the use of science has not really been heard in an Irish context.  That is starting to change, and Covid has had an impact.  We now need to go forward.  There is also an onus on the research community to become better at communication.  It is up to us to communicate.  It is a two-way system.<\/p> <p>  I will make another comment and Professor Lowery might come in on it.  We talk about ten academic institutions.  Each of those institutions has a natural affiliation with a clinical partner.  UCD, for example, has an interaction with St. Vincent's Hospital and the Mater Hospital, while Trinity College interacts with St. James's Hospital.  Each academic institution has an affiliation with a specific key clinical partner.  That is strong in order to reinforce those close academic links.  Professor Lowery might talk about, for example, the Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, which has now gone a step further in the Organisation of European Cancer Institutes, OECI, accreditation process.  Fundamentally, what we are talking about in AICRI is stepping beyond even that and providing a framework whereby those institutions come together, both the academic institutions and their affiliated clinical institutions, as one whole entity.  I do not know if Professor Lowery wishes to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Yes, I do.  There is a good example on the campus on which I work of how academia can work directly with patients and interact with patient care and those of us who provide patient care and those of us who straddle both worlds, if you like.  A couple of years ago, we established a cancer institute on the St. James's campus and on the Trinity College campus, namely, the Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute.<\/p><p>In 2019 we achieved designation from the Organisation of European Cancer Institutes, OECI, as a joint entity as a cancer centre.  It was an international benchmarking that showed we as joint collaborators, hospital and university, integrating research into the education of both patients and our healthcare staff but also integrating that directly into patient clinical care.  That is the international model of how excellent patient care is provided.  That is what it is our vision, on an all-Ireland basis, to do.  It is to take research from the academic institutions' silos and bring it to the patients.  That, as Mr. Molloy pointed out, should be a two-way process.  It must have patient involvement from the very beginning.<\/p><p> Mr. Molloy's point is really well-made.  We have not been good enough at ensuring the right patients are at the table at all those discussions because there are some patients who have a very high healthcare literacy and they feel cancer research is relevant to them and that they can come and ask me questions, Google things and come with a level of expertise around their cancer that is hugely impressive.  I met those patients when I lived in New York and I meet them now I live in Dublin.  However, I also meet the other patients who feel cancer research does not really apply to them and who would not feel they have the language, knowledge or maybe the education to be able to take ownership of that and to participate in these two-way discussions.  That is on us.  It is on us as a research and clinical community to go out there and provide for all patients from all economic and social backgrounds and from all racial backgrounds to be able to sit at the table and not have silos whereby some people feel it applies to them and some feel it does not.  That is something I have noticed personally.  It is really important that equity of access is applied across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Maeve Lowery","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>To add a concrete example, I am scientific director of DATA-CAN, which is the UK's health data research hub for cancer.  When we set it up we decided the patient would actually be at the centre, not just as a tick box but actually at the centre.  We have it that our patients actually lead some of our programmes.  They sit on our steering committee, which is the highest level of the committee.  Not only do they feel empowered, they are empowered.  They actually look at all the research work we are doing together.  They work with us, so we co-create a particular programme.  They will also look at programmes and say \"No, you should not be doing that research\".  They have the power of veto as well.  That is really the way one does proper patient-focused, patient-involved and patient-engaged research.  One moves away from the model where the patient is the passive recipient to where the patient is the active participant.  We have found it has been absolutely fundamental to our success because the patients have been able to point out things we have not thought about.  They have been able to put more of a patient focus on it in terms of quality of life and in terms of living with them beyond cancer.  In our interactions with other stakeholders, we have found that patient voice is not only heard but listened to and used to actually drive the programme.  Thus we are moving away from the patient simply being, as I said, a passive recipient to the patient being intimately involved.  That is the way one delivers the best-quality research for the patient and for members of the public, in relation to really delivering.  They must be intimately involved from the start.<\/p> <p>  Patients were involved when we writing the grant to get the funding to do the work from the very start.  That is really what we are trying in AICRI.  We are looking at a different way of doing things, not the traditional way it was done in the past.  We really need to bring that because patients talk to us and say they want to have a better quality of life so we should be studying quality of life.  We have done studies right across Europe and the amount of research that has been spent on quality of life is 2%.  That is just not good enough.  However, to drive that we need patients to tell us their experiences.  What are they experiencing in response to particular treatments or drugs?  Senator Currie asked about palliative care earlier.  They are the areas we should be working on as well.  It should not all be about the next big thing and innovation.

The chair of that committee, Patrick Kivlehan, is on our board, so it is involved in decision making around everything we do.  Tomorrow our disease-specific study group meetings are happening with all our researchers and doctors, in gynaecological cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer.  We have a patient advocate in each of those.  They ask questions and drive the agenda for the trials we are doing within Cancer Trials Ireland.  I am wearing these colours today in memory of someone who is an example of how patients are driving the desire to see more research in this country.  Pat Smullen, Lord rest his soul, was a very famous jockey.  He had pancreatic cancer and there were no options in the clinic for him.  He talked to us and said he wanted to help Cancer Trials Ireland.  We now have four clinical trials in pancreatic cancer because of the money Pat raised for our work through the horse racing community.<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of those examples where the public do not just want to know more about research, they want to drive it and drive investment in it.  It is something that is growing and growing.  We are going to see it in this group we have set up.  We know we are going to get support from the public.  We have done market research on public attitudes to clinical trials and 80% of the public support clinical trials and want to see further investment in it.  They also support sharing their data for the benefit of research and for the benefit of future treatments for patients and the public.  Mr. Molloy asked some really good questions and what happens when the treatments are found.  There is a whole argument around the costs of that and patients accessing that.  Professor Lowery made the point that health literacy is not the same for everyone.  We do our very best to reach out to the community.  That is a commitment we will make going forward as a group that the public engagement will be important.  That is different to the patient engagement.

I want the witnesses to use this forum in honesty to tell us whether there are blocks there that need to be removed.  Is there pushback or are we all on the same page?  It is important that if there is pushback we address it at this stage.  The frightening thing was one of the slides said four out of ten cancer patients are not getting their chemotherapy.<\/p><p>How big of a problem is it that we do not have the beds there in the hospitals?  I hear of stories where there are wonderful professionals, clinicians, and oncologists but if they do not have the beds then they are always going to be limited in what they need to or can do.  Lives are put at risk because of that.  There is a great deal there but perhaps in answering questions from the other members, our witnesses may be able to include some answers into those of mine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#H00400","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>To be fair to everybody, there are some top-class questions there.

It is very clear that health has been one of the most successful components of the North-South co-operation and will continue to be.  It is one of the very logical things to do on an all-island basis.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus briefly on the fact that a cancer strategy for Northern Ireland is overdue and is a New Decade, New Approach deal commitment.  I wondered what engagement our witnesses had in potentially ensuring that their project become a key component of that or is built in to the development of that strategy.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, focusing on the North as well, we have talked about biotechnology clusters and I know that that is something that Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast is obviously involved in.

We have also had quite a number of conversations where I presented this vision to Cancer Focus Northern Ireland, which is one of the main cancer charities in Northern Ireland.  There are definite opportunities there and this is very much on that agenda in how we can work together.<\/p> <p>  On the biotech sector and Invest NI, this is particularly relevant - and I will explain this now for other people in the group - because we are in the middle at the moment of the Belfast Region City Deal, which is a significant investment in infrastructure in Northern Ireland in a number of different areas including data, creative industries, health and life sciences clinical trials, and all of these are very relevant to this programme.  One of the things that we have been feeding into the Belfast Region City Deal and also to the Derry-Strabane City Deal are the opportunities to look at ways in which we can work together right across the island.  The SME is particularly important in Northern Ireland in respect of that community and we have been working very closely with it both in general as to both Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast and Ulster University but also in highlighting this potential opportunity.  <\/p> <p>  Hopefully, the Belfast Region City Deal will finally be announced at the end of next month and it is something that we have been working on for the past three years.  It is essentially a &pound;1 billion programme right across Northern Ireland in the Belfast city region, and, as I said, there are other deals as well.  These provide that opportunity for innovation and we certainly see cancer research and care being an integral part of that.<\/p> <p>  Going back, perhaps, I will answer Ms Hanna&rsquo;s question or part of it and I thank her for the questions.  I was there in 1999 in Government Buildings in Stormont.  A sense of excitement and a sense that this was something different very much permeated that which was to do with Professor Johnston and his vision.

Our witnesses have already referred to the Belfast Region City Deal issue and some of the projects in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  Also, on the perspective from Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, perhaps our witnesses might be able to talk about some of the other funds that are potentially available from the UK Government which are allocated on a competitive basis and to what extent can they be brought to the table to reinforce some of this work.<\/p> <p>  Then, more directly on the research pots that are available on a cross-border collaborative basis, first of all to what extent is Horizon Europe - as the successor to Horizon 2020 - a potential source of supports?  There was obviously a very strong collaborative foundation to begin with in that regard.  Is that a potential donor?  <\/p> <p>  Also, on the US angle, in addition to the very specific health tripartite relationship, to what extent can the more general US-Ireland research partnership be also used to support this initiative?

The first thing to indicate is that Irish researchers have very much taken a leadership role in cancer research programmes which have been funded at a European level.  For example, I have led five large-scale EU cancer research programmes and I have similar colleagues out there.  We are good at co-ordinating these types of complex network programmes at a European level and we are considered as being able to do that and we have equivalents in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the opportunity, again there is an EU Beating Cancer Plan which I believe has been allocated approximately &euro;4 billion and is one of the very significant projects at European level.  There are five dedicated missions, one of which is cancer.  These activities span from basic research towards the clinical arena.  It is important that we position ourselves for participation.  While we have had a good track record of participation in these programmes, the process has changed and one has to become clustered and very much more centralised in a team-based approach. <\/p> <p>  A good example of that would be - perhaps Professor Lowery might comment on this - where there is a push towards comprehensive cancer centres at a European level.<\/p><p>We do not currently have a comprehensive cancer centre in Ireland.  We have the OECI cancer centre established at Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute and there are similar institutions pursuing that.  The challenge is to become a comprehensive cancer centre because that is becoming the requirement for participation.  Again, it is called out in the national cancer strategy.  The AICRI can provide at least one mechanism or plank in terms of supporting that because what is critical for a comprehensive cancer centre is not only cancer care but also that research is an integral component of that.  It needs to have a very strong research agenda to be able to become a comprehensive cancer centre.  We can have an argument about whether it will be one site or a distributed site, or what is the accreditation system, but, ultimately, we need to come together to be able to participate at a European level and it is critical that we do that.  Professor Lawler may want to comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Farry for the question.  His previous involvement in health has been relevant in this regard.  We need to think North-South but also east-west.  There is a significant opportunity, particularly when the comprehensive spending review finally happens in the UK, in regard to opportunities there, both on an all-island basis but also from that east-west perspective.  We see this as being a significant opportunity in regard to ways in which the shared island unit can contribute.  The Taoiseach visited us in Queen&rsquo;s last week and one of the things we talked about specifically was how we can leverage this for something like cancer, which affects us all.  Certainly, partnership in Europe is something we have done a lot of in the past, as Professor Gallagher said, and I think we have significant opportunities.  It is very important to us, or certainly an advantage to us in a way, that cancer is the only health mission in the EU missions, in that five missions are identified but the only one related to health is cancer  Therefore, we have the opportunity and working together is going to make us better than the sum of our parts.<br\/><br\/>On Dr. Farry&rsquo;s other question, the opportunity of the city deals and what that is going to drive in innovation is very significant.  Part of that will be how we deal with data, which was a question asked earlier.  That is a conversation we need to have.  Sean O'Neill, who is the chief reporter for <i>The Times<\/i>, wrote an article two months ago where he said that we get the data and statistics every day for Covid and asked why we cannot get the same for cancer.  I would ask the same question.  If we had data every day on cancer, we would have much better opportunities to drive the research agenda and use it to influence how we treat our patients.  There is no technical reason we cannot have it, so we need to work together to look at the barriers we need to overcome to make that a reality.  There are examples where we have worked together in the context of Covid and cancer and where we have been able to bring together eight different bodies, all of them contributing their datasets.  I hate people who silo their data; it should be a criminal offence.  It is the public who are providing the data in many cases through the hospitals and the patients and, therefore, that data should be available to allow us to make rational decisions in regard to the care of our patients and our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Lawler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I want to come back to the comment on the comprehensive cancer centres and the importance of us working together in joining it up on an all-island basis.  I take Professor Lawler&rsquo;s point.  Cancer is still the number one killer in Ireland, ahead of Covid and cardiovascular disease.  We sometimes forget that and sometimes, unfortunately, our patients do not have such a strong voice.  It is very important to make that point and make it clear it is the number one killer of Irish people, North and South.<\/p> <p>  To come back to Professor Gallagher's point, I am the academic director of the Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, so I have an academic appointment at the university and a clinical appointment at St. James's, and I was part of the team that drove the accreditation process for the cancer centre at the Trinity St James's campus.  What that meant was that we started at the beginning and we were the first accredited cancer centre, although I hope we will not be the only one.  We drew those lines across the campus and asked how research can facilitate better clinical care pathways across all cancer types, and how it can facilitate better education for nursing staff or other front-line healthcare staff, and even those of us who are not on the front line.  That was a difficult process.  There was international benchmarking, of course, and we finally achieved our accreditation, but it does not stop there.  We see ourselves as an exemplar of how we can achieve step one but our goal, across all of Ireland, is to improve cancer outcomes nationally and take our seat internationally at the table as a country, not just a centre, that contributes to the global problem of cancer care.<\/p> <p>  I am here because I want to work with all of my colleagues, North and South.  I do not see how we could ever achieve the goal that we want to achieve for our patients alone.  It will happen not in one hospital, one county or one academic institution, and we need to extend our hands across to each other.  That is the only way any of us will achieve the goals we want to achieve.<\/p> <p>  I will take the opportunity to address the comment about nursing, which is very important because we do not have a nurse here today.  Our nurses have been on the front line of cancer care and Covid care.  Some of the nurses who work with me were seconded to intensive care in the middle of the first and second waves, and then went straight back down to the oncology day ward, which did not close.  They were exhausted and stressed, but they kept showing up and they are still showing up.  We have to realise that to maintain morale among our front-line healthcare staff across multiple disease types - cancer is just the one I work in - we have to provide a career pathway that is valuable, given the level of knowledge, skill, intelligence and achievement among our nurses but also our care attendants, physiotherapists, dietitians and all those who provide care in the hospital.  Unless we make their job better by integrating research and education into their day job, we are not going to retain the best.  It is not just about retention; it is about attracting the best, training them to be the best and making sure we keep them.  That is across not just doctors, but across all the staff who work across our universities and, importantly, within our hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Maeve Lowery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>There was a comment on US-Ireland partnership, which Professor Lawler might cover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":593,"content":"<p>One of the things we did just before lockdown is that Ms Mulroe and I were in the National Cancer Institute in Washington and we also presented on the US-Ireland bipartite agreement.  We certainly got a very good reception in respect of the concept of the AICRI but also the opportunity to contribute and compete for part of the funding for that.  My understanding, and maybe this is where the committee can help us, is that that fund is going to be continued but also potentially expanded.  We have cancer projects within that, and I am involved in one with the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland and GE Healthcare in the US, but there should be more of them.  They have proven themselves to be very effective and we should look to expand them, and having more cancer projects would be part of that.  If we were looking at an ask, we would certainly be looking at that and at what the opportunities might be in regard to the research that we are doing together.  There are good examples where we have shown we can work together and it is about looking to expand those opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The training piece is very important as well, to come back to Dr. Farry&rsquo;s question.  It is about ways in which we can give innovative training so that some of our younger people can really get that opportunity to spend time.  For example, we have a PhD programme at the moment where our students go from Queen&rsquo;s to the National Cancer Institute, NCI - they do a masters in Queen's and they then spend three years at the NCI.  We would like to expand that to be an all-island programme, which would be a great example of how we work together.  That is actually how people work together.  It is when students are working with each other that the principal investigators also work with each other, so it is almost a cycle of innovation and of bringing people together.  That would certainly be an example of something we would like to bring onto an all-island basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Lawler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I want to follow up on that with a concrete example.

First, I have had cancer in the past couple of years and, second, North-South development is a key part of Aont&uacute;'s political project.  Sometimes statistics are gathered on a North-South basis.  It is very hard to understand exactly what the situation is when there is partition in statistics.  Are cancer statistics now gathered on an all-island basis?  In the duration of this particular presentation by the witnesses, nine people have been diagnosed with cancer, which shows how shockingly prevalent it is and how many families are hit by it.  While not wishing to introduce a negative into what has been a positive presentation, are there limits to what can be done?  Is the working group limited by law regarding what it can do?  Are there funding constraints that we can be involved in trying to fix?  How much funding does the group get?  Is it facing any other resistance in this regard?  How do we move from all-Ireland research with regard to cancer to the delivery of treatment on an all-Ireland basis in respect of which we are planning together, funding together and delivering services together to make sure we have more effective services for people?<\/p> <p>  The next issue might be slightly outside of the witnesses' bailiwick.  Last year's report from the National Cancer Registry shows that Ireland's survival rate for, say, breast cancer is 82%.  That is quite poor by European standards.  For example, in Sweden a woman is 7% more likely to survive for five years or more than if she was diagnosed in Ireland.  In Britain, a woman is 5% more likely to survive for five years or more.  It is not just about geography; there can be a 12% differential depending on whether a woman is diagnosed or treated in a public hospital or a private hospital.  As I said, that may not specifically be the witnesses' area of expertise, but I would greatly appreciate it if they could address the issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#L00900","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>On the all-island statistics, the answer is \"Yes\".  We have done that in the past.  An all-island cancer atlas has been produced.  One of the things we have been talking about in the implementation group is doing an update of that.  I am chairperson of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership that has produced some of the data the Deputy mentioned regarding the differences between Ireland and Sweden, etc.  We are very much working together now to close that gap.  There is a huge opportunity there.  Again, it relates to the need to have access to data.  It is important to emphasise that there are challenges on both sides of the border in regard to data.  It is probably easier to do it in the North, but the lack of an electronic patient record in the South is hindering the ability to bring together all of that data.   That said, we have done a lot of really good things together.  A new director of the National Cancer Registry in Cork was recently appointed.  The two cancer registries are working closely and they are part of the programme we have talked about.  They are putting in a specific application in regard to them working together on an all-island basis.  There are challenges, but there are also opportunities.  We need the data to flow more freely.  This is where political will and political support can help us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Lawler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question on limits in terms of what we can do and funding constraints, but I will ask Professor Lowery and Ms Mulroe to first cover the issue of delivery of treatment on an all-island basis, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":606,"content":"<p>It is important that when we think about the provision of care on an all-island basis we think about what the future holds.  We need to be thinking about cancer care in five, ten and 15 years' time.  We know that over the past 20 years cancer care has become incredibly more complex and more personalised, meaning not a one-size-fits-all approach for cancer treatment, but identifying a subgroup of common cancers and targeting of treatment particularly towards a subgroup where we know that treatment might work better.  The complexity of the treatment we deliver has become incrementally more complicated.  Immunotherapies have their specific side effects.  Under the national chimeric antigen receptor, CAR, T-cell programme which has just started at St. James's Hospital, we take immune cells from a patient with cancer, which we send to the US to have engineering done to make them cancer killer cells specific to that patient's cancer and then we infuse them back into that patient.  That is an all-island service.  It is probably one of the major areas of future development in cancer care.<\/p> <p>  When we are looking at and thinking about implementing or providing care, we are not thinking about what we have now but about what we need in a decade.  On an island of our size, there is no way we will be able to deliver what is needed individually at small silo sites.  Given the complexity of cancer care that we know we are going to need to deliver over the next couple of decades, in particular the next ten years, we are going to have to work together.  Why should a patient not be able to travel from Belfast to Dublin or Dublin to Derry to have a specialised treatment for his or her cancer?  We cannot provide every treatment at every site.  If we work together, we better able to provide the infrastructure to deliver that level of care.  All of the treatments we now provide in-clinic came from research.  They all started off in a laboratory such as Professor Gallagher's and they all had to come through that translation part, such as is provided by Professor Lowery, figuring out what cancer it is best to test it on, following which they were put into clinical trial, operated by all of investigators working with Ms Mulroe.  The next step is proving that it works.  The pathway to cancer care - I am speaking not only of drug treatment but across the gamut of how we intervene in a patient care pathway - starts with research.  If we begin working together, then that will feed into the future development of cancer services North and South.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Maeve Lowery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>It is great when colleagues say everything you were going to say, as has just happened in terms of the responses given by Professor Gallagher and Professor Lowery.  To come back to the person, for the person with cancer in Monaghan who knows there is a trial happening in Derry or Belfast it is ability to be able to travel across the border and access that trial.  We have had examples of that within cancer trials, where patients from the very southern part of the country travelled to Belfast because it was the only site in the country that was facilitating that particular clinical trial.  Before we joined here today - members who are on Twitter might have seen this - one of our oncology colleagues in Cork asked us to bring up the issue of how to make it easier for us to refer patients cross-border because at the moment that is really tricky.  In terms of the cross-border directive, the administration is in place for travel cross-border for treatment but not necessarily for cancer trials.<\/p><p>It can be tricky.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n talked about resistance in the system, and that is certainly one of the things that is resisting at the moment, where patients can actually travel.  On the other hand, we are trying to ensure we are opening trials on both sides of the Border so there is less of that.<\/p><p> It is an important point, that equity of access irrespective of where you are in the country, that you are not disadvantaged by where you live, by who you are or by your education.  We all here share that value, that we do not want to get to that point.  That is where the statistics and the data, which were mentioned earlier, become very important.  It goes back to Professor Patrick Johnson, the history of why we are all here and the first memorandum of understanding, MOU, between North and South, which funded the national cancer registry.  It was the first real North and South collaboration so staff in the North and staff in the South worked together, and now we have Professor Deirdre Murray, who is the head of the national cancer research registry.  More resources are needed, however.<\/p><p> The other side of this is that when they collect data right now on the incidence of people with cancer in our system, they are looking at paper files.  As Professor Mark Lawler has pointed out, we do not have an electronic health registry in the Republic of Ireland.  I used to sit on the e-health board of the HSE and, to be honest, I was very frustrated at the lack of progress made on that.  We need to look at and realise we can learn from the North because in hospitals in the North there is connection between patient data.  Whether you are visiting a hospital in Craigavon and then you are in Belfast City Hospital, your data are in one place and are accessible.  We do not quite have that yet in the South.<\/p><p> You may wonder why someone from Cancer Trials Ireland is saying this.  When we have patients on clinical trials, we have to send our auditors to look at all of the patient notes that are relevant to the clinical trial and ensure everything that should be done is done, and practised safely.  That would be so much more efficient if we were able to do that, and particularly during Covid it became so obvious because we could not get into hospitals as we were not allowed in and our recruitment to clinical trials dropped by 40% because of that.  We have talked about the resistance piece.  That issue is very important.<\/p><p> I want to come back on the piece about nurses.  Clinical research nurses have been described to me by patients as like having your mother holding your hand on your first day at school.  They are the most important person to a patient in a clinical trial because he or she is facing his or her clinical research nurse more often than anyone else in the treatment, yet we do not have a proper career structure for such nurses.  Clinical research nurses are not treated in the same way as other nurses within the system.  That could also be said for every other medical discipline like dieticians and physiotherapists who work on research within the system.  Solving that problem is also something the committee could help us with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question on the limits on what you can do and what we are planning.  One thing to note is that a cancer could have started ten or 15 years earlier as an altered cell in the body and it has taken time to develop into a presentable cancer.  The study of cancer is, therefore, a long-term issue.  It takes time to study it.  We are trying to accelerate, fast-track and bring innovations closer, but sustainability is needed in terms of a research programme.  The stop-start nature of research programmes has been a challenge in an Irish context.  We have fantastic research programmes and I have led a few of them where things were great for five or six years but then everything stopped, and then you had to start to reinvent and do it again.  That is not how cancer research is done effectively.<\/p> <p>  The Cancer Moonshot in the US was a game changer.  A decision was made to do it, substantial resources were provided and there was a long-term vision.  To me, we need a long-term vision that is a minimum of ten years and probably 20 years.  The funding agencies do not really have that mindset and it is generally between three and five years, so that is why an integrated approach is needed.  That is what we are doing.  We are using a bottom-up initiative to define the key issues we want to address.  At the moment we are using a piecemeal approach to identifying opportunities and bidding for those which fit that plan, but that is not ideal.  We very much want a unified approach.<\/p> <p>  As Professor Lawler mentioned, the national development plan contains plans to create all-island research centres.  There are pre-existing examples of these substantive centres working very effectively in Ireland.  For example, the Insight Centre for Data Analytics involves several hundred people and it has shown significant impacts in terms of economic impact.  The APC Microbiome Ireland Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre in Cork is a world leader in researching the microbiome and its interesting role in cancer.  We want something similar in the cancer space because we need such a mechanism to integrate people.  In the absence of that, we will keep going forward but the scenario is not ideal.  We have the vision to do this but need the mechanisms to bring this forward.<\/p> <p>  The PEACE Plus programme is fantastic because it has the potential to fund elements of the healthcare intervention aspects, but we need a component.  We have shown what we can do, for example, with the breast predict programme.  We received &euro;7.5 million from the Irish Cancer Society, which came from people putting coins in buckets and companies donating money.  With that &euro;7.5 million, an additional &euro;50 million was leveraged in EU and external funding, which had very significant long-term impacts in terms of clinical trials and new diagnostics.  Unfortunately, the programme has ended and it is very hard to have that legacy.  Some of the fruit that was developed fell off the tree and you can only take certain things forward.  We want to change that and keep those things going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Professor William Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I thank everybody attending the committee today for an informative debate, and I thank the witnesses for their informative and important presentations.

Our delivery of care has changed and needs to change further, for cancer and for everything else.  I know about cancer so I can speak to that.  It is both a challenge and an opportunity.  We have been doing things one way for a long time.  For chemotherapy, people get in their car, drive, park, get blood tests done, sit and wait and a nurse hangs the chemotherapy drip.  Now we are thinking about how we stop people coming to hospitals.  Why do people need to come to St. James's Hospital?  Perhaps we should go to them.  If patients are sick from the chemotherapy, we ask them to come in to us so we can have a look at them.  Why do we not go out to them?  Why do we not say we will go to see them and see how they are doing today, perhaps with a nurse and an outreach service that does this?  Suddenly there is a shift from where we always said to come on in and everyone sits together and waits.  Now we are thinking this is not safe and wondering whether it was ever quite right.  It is a big challenge but I also see it as a big opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Applied research can help us with this.  St. James's Hospital is the only cancer centre in the country to have an electronic record and thank goodness we have it.  It insulated us a lot from the cyberattack.  We have been utilising it for research.  We think that in the next five years patients will want to read their electronic health records.  It will not just be I who reads it and writes things about patients, who have to go to another office to request to have it printed out and given to them.  They should be able to see what I am writing about them and understand it.  They should also see their blood tests and CAT scan results and what the dieticians have said about them.  It should be presented to them in a way they can absorb and understand so they can come back and interrogate us with some questions.  It will probably be an app.  It will not necessarily mean logging onto a desktop.  This has to evolve for the provision of care and education.  Of course it would also facilitate research and data collection.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge opportunity to change what we are doing.  If we work together we can do it quicker.  Change does not come that quickly.  There is a big opportunity, greater than there has been over past decades, to look to see how we can change the delivery of healthcare.  This is the point about what a researcher looks like.  A lot of the research is driven by nurses.  We need to look at the pathway of nursing PhDs and masters programmes and make sure those nurses who provide care in clinics have an opportunity to use what they have learned over those decades of service and apply the right research to answer the questions and deliver the care they want to give.  It is not the answer to all of the problems but it can help accelerate the solving of some of the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Maeve Lowery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>My mother would love to hear that, having crossed the Border every day to work as a nurse in the North.

I spent a lot of time with Professor Richard Wilson when he was in the Northern Ireland cancer trials unit.  I also worked with Dr. Melanie Morris and Professor Stuart McIntosh  We have shared challenges with regard to people and protected time in our clinical research.  The doctors, nurses and dieticians doing this research and trials while working with patients need to have time to do it.  We do not have enough of these people.  There is no point in protecting time to do research if people do not have that time.  Patient care is always going to be the first port of call.  We need a shared approach on the island to build a culture of research and to increase the number of people working in our hospitals.  It is like a chicken and egg.  If we provide a research-rich environment in hospitals, people from all over the world will want to work here because of it: not just Irish people who want to come home but others.

People in the system are tired.  It has been tough.  I do not know whether our colleagues in the North know a lot about the ransomware attack but it was as challenging as the pandemic for some of the sites involved.  They had to try to continue to provide care as well as carry out research with no Internet, computers or phones.  This was the reality.  We owe a debt of gratitude to all of those people who soldiered through a very difficult 18 months.  That was a particular blow.

At that time we started the work, nobody knew what would be the impact of Covid on cancer.<\/p><p>We decided to take a fundamentally different approach to collecting cancer data than had been done up to that point.  We collected data in a deep way so that we got a lot of information but slowly.  The problem was that when you looked at the national data on cancer, there was no evidence the pandemic was having any effect.  The reason for that was data were six to nine months out of date whereas we went to a network of hospitals across the UK, including all five hospital trusts in Northern Ireland, and we were able to see what was happening in real time.  That allowed us to highlight the problem, we brought that to the four chief medical officers for each of the nations of the United Kingdom and that prompted them to decide to restart cancer services because they could see that it was being made worse rather than better.  That is a good example of how data allowed us to make changes and decisions.<\/p><p> Interacting with other countries was fundamental.  I am a member of the board of the European Cancer Organisation and I co-chair the special network on Covid-19 and cancer.  We have gone to 30 countries in Europe and we have a \"Time to Act\" campaign that we will launch in Ireland in January, to which we will invite all of the members.  Importantly, we have translated that into 30 different languages and I am glad to say Irish is one of those.  It is important to work together because it allows people to learn.  For example, it looks like the Netherlands did better than a lot of other countries did in Europe so we need to examine why that is the case and if we can learn from that.  We do not want to have point scoring around who is on top of the league but we want to find out if there was something the Netherlands did that was fundamentally different, and it looks like there was.  The Netherlands set up diagnostic centres away from the hospitals quite early and it treated people for cancer in Covid-lite hospitals.  That sort of thing is critical.  It showcases that what one country has done is better and then other countries learn from that country.  That constant learning and innovation circle is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021102100002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Lawler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>It has been a heartening and uplifting meeting and I compliment each of our witnesses.  Their commitment to their patients and professions comes across in every utterance they have made.  I wish them well with the very important work they carry out on behalf of our society.  As was said in the AICRI's introduction, unfortunately none of our families have avoided the scourge of cancer through death and illness.  It is a subject that is of huge importance to all of us.  I also want to say that the message to the committee and the wider public is that politics works.  The existence of the Good Friday Agreement allowed this co-operation to start in the first place with memorandums of understanding and then funding being accessed for the PEACE PLUS programme.  We have moved on to the shared island initiative of an Taoiseach, which will be crucial in supporting the AICRI's work on an all-Ireland basis in the future.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of the EU cross-border health directive, which has been replaced by the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme since Britain left the European Union with the same processes in place.  That has been established on an administrative basis and in the new year there will be legislation going through the Oireachtas to put it on a statutory footing.  The AICRI might advise the committee on the need to facilitate trials under that particular scheme and we could try to advance that on a cross-party basis when the legislation is being discussed in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  As a long-serving member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I am glad we are talking about the provision of cancer services on an all-Ireland and transatlantic basis and across the European Union, and as has been said, it is hoped further afield in the area of research as well.  I was a member of Government in the mid-2000s when we began a programme of rationalisation of small cancer services in most of our county and regional hospitals.  There was a huge opposition to that but it was the right thing to do and to have services provided where there could be a multidisciplinary team in place.  Some of us got a hell of a lot of abuse at that time for backing the proposals to rationalise and provide a better service in fewer hospital settings.  That has worked and naturally there is room for improvement, but alongside that development we had developments like chemotherapy being delivered in Cavan General Hospital.  We could not have had that in the past were it not for the linkages with the Mater hospital and Beaumont Hospital, and I am sure that is replicated in other places throughout the country.  We want to see more of that being done when it is feasible to do so.<\/p> <p>  US President Biden referenced this work and the AICRI during his St. Patrick's Day meeting with an Taoiseach.  He did not reference that off the top of his head because speaking notes would be prepared for such a meeting and those would have gone through his senior personnel and health officials.  That showed the eminence he holds for the work that is being done by the AICRI on an all-Ireland and transatlantic basis, and it is heartening to hear that.<\/p> <p>  When I first had contact with some of the witnesses and heard of the development of the AICRI, I thought the idea was to have a new building and stand-alone facility.  I was delighted to learn that was not the case and that it was using existing partners, not just in research institutes or universities but in hospitals, which are an essential part of research and medicine.  When we saw the presentation it showed how many partners the AICRI has working together in collaboration.  It is a model of what can be and what is being done daily to bring about improvements we all want to see in cancer care.<\/p> <p>  The themes I took from today's meeting and from all the contributions were the patient being at the centre and equity of access.  Those are important and essential messages around the delivery of healthcare.  As an island it makes sense and it is heartening and progressive that we are working on an all-Ireland and transatlantic basis, particularly with the United States.  I refer to Stephen Farry's question about collaboration at a European Union level, and perhaps Professor Lawler will come back on this.  Years ago when Mr. David Byrne was Ireland's EU Commissioner, among his responsibilities at the time was health.  He argued strongly at that time that health needed to be an EU competence because so many challenges were coming up and so much needed to be done that countries could not do with their own competence alone.  One of the witnesses mentioned the global effort to develop a vaccine for Covid earlier, which has been successful.  Today we are talking about a booster vaccine after more than 90% of our population has had its second dose.  That shows the success of science, the importance of the global effort and of governments throughout the world putting the necessary funding into such work.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the following initial comments of our witnesses on the vision of the AICRI, \"We will become a global leader in cancer research and, as a result, we will give much needed hope to patients with cancer and their families.\"  It is a heartening message and it is to be hoped those of us in public life as well as the public at large would hear that message.

If one looks at melanoma, it is rising at epidemic proportions, but science can address that.  We have become better.  We have the example of Covid.  We have already done this in the cancer research agenda.  The technologies used in the context of the Covid vaccination arose out of cancer research activities, but we need to keep innovating and get faster.  Classically, drug development took 15 years.  That needs to be brought closer and faster.  The AICRI fulfils a need for a common research framework throughout the island.  We need the committee's support and endorsement for that.

The Minister can be far-reaching in what he can do within the guidelines.  There are not sufficient limitations.  Public consultation would be one measure to provide a check or balance, allowing public input into, and scrutiny over, what a Minister might do under these guidelines.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about that.<\/p> <p>  If we do not plan properly and if the Minister is drawing up and issuing guidelines without consulting people, consider the damage that could be done to our cetaceans.

I refer to amendment No. 52 and to amendment No. 61 in particular, which also relates to directives.  I note that we now have policy statements, guidelines and directives.  Before all of that, we have plans.  I am trying to understand the relationship between these different things and the precise hierarchy and relationship between them.  It is fair to say that with all these different mechanisms for dictating by the Minister - because the Minister has the power to do these things - there seems to be a lot of power and many different avenues provided by the Minister to change things as they as move along.  As we will see in the next grouping, there is a requirement to comply with these policy statements, guidelines, and directives, if I understand correctly.  We have sought to delete line 35 in the subsequent group of amendments that we will deal with shortly.  These mechanisms will be available to the Minister to direct and to give guidelines, that is, issue instructions and give the Minister a hell of a lot of power.  One would worry about that sort of arbitrary power being given to the Minister.  While we may have great confidence in the Minister of State sitting here in the room with us, who knows what sort of Minister we might have in the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point is important as well.  Rightly and understandably, there is a huge need to address the climate crisis but the biodiversity crisis is not mentioned as often.  In fact, when one thinks about it deeply enough, a collapse in ecosystems could probably damage our ability to sustain our existence on this planet sooner than climate change.  The collapse of whole ecosystems could have disastrous and unknown consequences, because everything is connected.  We all depend on these interconnected chains called ecosystems.  The marine, marine life and marine biology are all critical to our existence on this planet.  There is a lot at stake, therefore.  By requiring public consultation on all of these things, we are ensuring that it will not just be a hell of a lot of power concentrated in the hands of a single Minister but that everybody, including all stakeholders and society generally ,would have a voice in this.  The Minister would have to meet many checks and balances in the objectives in developing the marine.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#C00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 48 proposes public consultation on any marine planning guidelines in line with the State's obligations under the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive and the Aarhus Convention.  By their nature, such guidelines will require strategic environmental assessment.  Integral to that process is public consultation.  Guidelines prepared without that assessment and consultation would not survive judicial review.  The term &ldquo;full public consultation&rdquo; is also technically problematic.  It is not a defined term and contains an inherent risk that any consultation, no matter how comprehensive, could be challenged on the basis that it is not full or complete.  Simply, direct and unspecific reference to the Aarhus Convention is not only unnecessary, it is legally problematic given the range of enabling legislation and European directives already in place giving effect to the principles set out therein.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 52 proposes that public consultation is undertaken for the making, amending or revocation of any guidelines.  This is an overly onerous and restrictive provision.  It would oblige public consultation on the correction of even a single typographical error.  Any amendment to the guidelines will be subject to SEA screening, and full SEA including public consultation, if required.  There may also be a need to urgently amend any guidelines resulting from emergent case law, both domestic and European.  Guidelines would normally be revoked where a new set of superseding guidelines are developed.  It would not be practical or best use of resources to hold a separate consultation specifically on revocation.  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 61 proposes public consultation on every directive or amendment or revocation.  By their very nature, directives may be needed urgently to ensure the legally robust functioning of the marine planning system.  Directives issued under this section will be subject to obligations under section 31 in respect of appropriate assessment, AA, and strategic environmental assessment, SEA.  If such assessments are screened in, public consultation will be undertaken as a matter of course and existing obligation.  I therefore oppose these amendments.<\/p> <p>  There appears to be a misunderstanding of the purpose of these guidelines and policy directives.  They are used to ensure that the system that is being designed here operates as intended.  They will be drawn up and will operate within the policy framework, as set up in the national marine planning framework that has been approved by the Oireachtas.  They are there to make it work.  They are also there to show specific public bodies how they can comply with the policies and objectives of the national marine planning framework, maritime spatial plan, or designated marine area plans, DMAPS.  Moreover, in some extreme cases, they can direct them to act in a certain way in order to comply with these policies or with emerging case law.  They are created in a system that is designed around the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive, has also had regard to the marine strategy framework, MSF, directive and the principles established in the Aarhus Convention, as already transposed in Ireland.  The SEA and AA-related directives already apply to them by reference to section 31 of the Bill.  It is simply not necessary to restate these things in every Part of this Bill; it is unwieldy and would have a myriad of unintended consequences.  In addition, there appears to be a perception that the Government is currently avoiding consultation with the public generally.  That simply could not be further from the truth.  Consultation and, more appropriately, participation occur in a variety of ways.  To give the most recent example of guidelines that I published under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, namely, the draft development plan guidelines for planning authorities, these were placed on public display for the acceptance of submission from 13 August 2021 to 8 October 2021, a period of almost nine weeks.  However, to get to that point, a high degree of consultation with various stakeholders was carried out.  This was to ensure their operational effectiveness.  Appropriate consultation does take place in respect of such guidance already.  It will continue to do so under the provisions drafted, where appropriate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#C00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It was stated that these would mean a correction of a typo would require public consultation.  That is a bit of a stretch and nobody would suggest that these amendments would mean that the correction of a typo would require public consultation.  The general understanding is that any material changes would require public consultation but that a typo correction would not.  The Minister of State might give some examples of where typo corrections require public consultation, seeing as that is his stated position on this.  I do not accept that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State also indicated that there would need to be a separate consultation on the revoking of guidelines.  At the same time, he states that the revoking of guidelines would nearly always happen in conjunction with new guidelines being introduced.  It is quite clear that where new guidelines are being introduced and other guidelines are being revoked, there could be a consultation process on the revoking of guidelines and introduction of new guidelines if it is all part of the same process.  Given that the Minister of State argues that it would be a rare scenario for guidelines to just be revoked on their own without new guidelines being introduced, the scenario about which he is worried - the revocation of guidelines requiring a separate consultation - would not frequently arise, if ever.<\/p> <p>  I have the same concerns about the Minister of State's indication that there will only be public consultation after a screening process, especially with regard to directives.  These amendments specifically seek public consultation in all scenarios.  Between these guidelines, the directives and the policy statements, there is so much leeway for a Minister to set the direction and the impact it can have.<\/p> <p>  If the guidelines are of significance, and they will be, the Minister will not set them for no reason.  We have seen in other planning areas where guidelines can have a major impact.  Whether a screening process decides public consultation is required or not, it is very clear that public consultation is needed given that these guidelines will be of significance.  They are significant enough to be in the legislation we are discussing now and what is to be put on a statutory basis.  Given the extent of the powers, they are significant enough to go to public consultation as part of a system of checks and balances on these quite strong powers that the Minister is to be given with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#D00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I will try to be nice in what I say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#D00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":661,"content":"<p>We are in public session as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#D00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>The Minister of State knows quite well that we are not talking about typos and that our concern is that guidelines which could have a real, substantial and material impact should be subject to a requirement for public consultation.

Directions involve being more explicit because the Minister will be directing a particular course of events.  For instance, in the event that an entity such as the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, does not do what the policy says it should do, the Minister may issue a direction to ensure that it does so.  Guidelines are more subjective.  We have offshore renewable energy guidelines, for example.

Solar panels or some of the emergency measures introduced in planning about on-street dining and such are examples.  Some of those are planning guidelines.  How can we better involve the Oireachtas?

The net effect of the proposals would be that the Oireachtas would take the role of the Minister of the day on a day-to-day operational level of the planning regime.  The Oireachtas is not and cannot be the marine spatial planning body.  The text is largely copied from those earlier amendments and, as such, contains the same technical deficiencies as already debated.<\/p> <p>  The requirement for such detailed engagement with the Oireachtas would limit the finalisation of such documents to the periods in which the Oireachtas was sitting and had the available capacity to deal with such matters.  Such a restriction brings with it the problematic risk of the entire marine planning system grinding to a halt during periods in which the Oireachtas was not sitting or did not have capacity where a guideline or directive was necessary to ensure legally robust functioning of the planning system.  That would be an unprecedented constraint for any regulatory system and I sincerely doubt people would thank us for introducing it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 54 sets out the process for the Oireachtas approval, which is entirely inappropriate for ministerial guidelines and would be inconsistent with other provisions on the Statute Book.  Amendment No. 60 limits such guidance to the consideration of specific matters which are in the formulation of an amendment that has already been rejected.  Amendment No. 64 again sets out an Oireachtas process entirely at odds with the purpose of a ministerial function.

This gets to the nub of it.  If we got clarity on this we could move through this Bill much more quickly.  Is it correct that these directives would require that before consents for development are given, the directives are fully complied with, which is what Europe wants, and then we can move to the issue of applications, consents, enforcement and all the rest of it but in the first instance we must have a plan, which must be compliant with the various directives?  Rightly or wrongly, we have a concern that there may be development consents given where those plans are not fully in place.  In particular, the relevant projects could get consents when plans are not in place.  How would that stand in respect of the directives?  That is one of our central concerns and one of the central concerns of people looking in here.  If we could get clarity, it would help.  Have people reason to be concerned?  The ideal would be to have the marine plan, which is similar to a development plan.  We know what can be done here and there and people will only be allowed do things in those places.  Once this is up and running fully that might be the way it is going to be but in advance of that people do not necessarily have to be subject to a plan.  If that is the case then that is our concern.  Clarity on that would help us a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#N03500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>In the first instance, we have a plan.

I am concerned that, if someone can get a development consent on the basis of a fairly general framework, it will be an easier threshold for a developer to pass than a DMAP or a more specific spatial plan under which we had decided that an area was protected, developers could do something in another area, etc.  The framework does not go to that level of detail, yet we are envisaging that we will have plans that are that specific.

What is encompassed by maritime spatial planning must be clearly set out in the Bill, and it is very important we do it so we do not end up before national and EU courts and create potential delays in marine activity.  It is essential we have sufficient marine protection with an emphasis on rehabilitation and conservation, which we are legally obliged to deliver.  We should already have delivered that and we have been remiss in not putting in place sufficient marine protection, rehabilitation and conservation.  We must move very swiftly to ensure we do that.<\/p><p>There are other complex environmental considerations that must also be taken into account in spatial planning.  This is not discretionary, and that is why I spoke before about the importance of the directives relating to marine planning in that respect.  They are legal requirements and are not discretionary.  That is why it is important with the directives to understand the difference between transposition of a directive and conformity with directives.  That relates to our previous conversation and it is why there are checks both on transposition and conformity.  Of course, conformity is all about compatibility.  What I was seeking in previous amendments was to ensure compatibility and what I am trying to do with this amendment is ensure compatibility as well.<\/p><p>I can give an example of good practice from another jurisdiction that relates to marine rehabilitation and conservation.  Scotland has set up the Scottish marine environmental enhancement fund.  It is a very good model and something we should do here.  All wind and renewable energy in the marine environment has a condition of the licence that there must be a contribution to the fund.  The fund is used to support communities, environmental and coastal groups that work in the marine and it allows them to carry out marine biodiversity projects, along with conservation and rehabilitation.<\/p><p>It is very important we write into the Bill as much as possible measures that will lead to that sort of good practice seen in Scotland.  That is why I am putting forward these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#S02400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":963,"content":"<p>Given we have only a few minutes left, I reserve the right to come back on some of the latter amendments in this group as I will only get to the first few.<\/p> <p>  Again, some of my questioning is really just an invitation for the Minister of State to explain the intricacies of this process a little more on the public record.

We thank Vice Chairman, Deputy Eamon &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, and members of the committee for giving us the opportunity to address them today on the issue of the over-representation of Travellers in prison and the work of the Travellers in Prison Initiative, TPI.   The TPI is a St Stephen&rsquo;s Green Trust, SSGT, programme and it is funded by SSGT, the Irish Prison Service, IPS, and the Probation Service.  Its overall aim is to embed changes in policy and practice that have a positive influence on Travellers in prison, their families and communities.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with a short slide presentation, giving the committee a brief overview of the extent of the over-representation of Travellers and other ethnic minority groups in prison and to give an explanation for that.  As the committee will be aware, Travellers in Ireland represent less than 1% of the total population, but they account for 10% of the prison population.   Traveller women make up, at least, 15% of all women in prison.  <\/p> <p>  As can be seen from the first slide, this over-representation is not unique to Ireland or to Travellers.  Minority and indigenous groups the world are over-represented in prison.  As can be seen from the slide, in New Zealand the Maori people account for 13% of the population, but over half the prison population.  Likewise, for Australia, Canada and the other countries.  For women from these groups, the picture is even more stark.  Again, in New Zealand, Maori women make up 13% of the general population, but 56% of the prison population.  Likewise in the other countries.  <\/p> <p>  Why is this case?  We went through some international research to try to find the common causes for this.  As can be seen from the slide, these include the effects of colonisation and forced assimilation, the legacy of stripping indigenous people of their land, culture, language, laws and customs, the disruption of culture and traditions and denial of their identity.<\/p><p>The question then is how this relates to Travellers.  I am sure this committee knows well how that relates to Travellers.  The first instance is the 1963 Report of the Commission on Itinerancy, in which there is talk of the problem of \"the presence ... of itinerants in considerable numbers\" and \"social problems inherent in their way of life&rsquo;, and the plan discussed where \"itinerants as a class would disappear\" within a generation and there would be a \"final solution\" to the problem.<\/p><p> Since then, many laws and policies have been introduced which have had a negative impact on Travellers' way of life and on their legitimate ways to make a living.  It was not until 2017 that the Government formally recognised Travellers as an ethnic minority.<\/p><p> Other areas the research identified were poverty and exclusion, high levels of unemployment, poor housing, educational disadvantage, poor health and mental health problems.  This committee again knows well how that impacts on Travellers.  They are just some of the statistics for Travellers with regard to unemployment and health.  Suicide is seven times the average for the general population, etc.<\/p><p> The next area the research looked at was discrimination and oppression.  Like minority indigenous groups in other countries, they had experience of discrimination in accessing goods and services, were described in the media as criminals, experienced a justice system with conscious and unconscious racism and suffered effects of oppression.  That includes addiction, the use of alcohol and other drugs.<\/p><p> Again, how does this relate to Travellers?  We are well aware of the discrimination Travellers experience in accessing services.  Anybody on social media is well aware of the levels of hate speech when the issue of Travellers comes up.  In a positive or negative context, there are always negative comments.  In an internal Garda survey, not a single front-line garda had a positive attitude on Travellers.  Similar to the other minority indigenous groups, the early onset of drugs and problematic drug use is linked to the trauma and oppression in their lives.<\/p><p> The final area I am looking at is around women.  The research shows that they have faced particular issues.  They suffer even more than men in prison and before imprisonment, they have issues with housing, poverty, mental health and trauma.  We did some research with Traveller women in prison and they all faced those issues.  I will not go into much detail on that here because Ms Joyce, my colleague, is going to talk more on the issue of Traveller women in prison.<\/p><p> I am not condoning crime in any form.  I fully acknowledge the hurt and damage it causes across society.  We all know that crime-free societies will benefit everybody.  If we are really serious about trying to create safer societies, however, we must address the injustices that are often the root causes of crime.  My presentation today gave a very fast overview of some of these injustices.<\/p><p> Even from a purely economic perspective, imprisonment is a very expensive way to try to reduce crime.  At our recent conference, for example, President Higgins spoke about the injustice of cuts to Traveller education during the last recession; cuts that have not been reinstated and that have hugely negative impacts on Travellers' participation and outcomes in education.  It is not rocket science to realise that it would be more cost-effective for the State to invest in addressing educational disadvantage and other causes rather than imprisonment.  It is clear that the justice system alone cannot address this issue but it can play a really important part in improving outcomes for Travellers in prison and reducing the likelihood of them reoffending.<\/p><p> I will provide an outline of some recommendations for positive change.  At our recent conference, Traveller men who had been in prison spoke about the issues they experienced in prison and the changes needed.  They spoke about the common use of racist language in prison and the hurt and damage it causes them.  They asked the Irish Prison Service, IPS, to send a message from the top down that there will be zero tolerance of that language and that there will be consequences for prisoners and staff who continue to use it.<\/p><p> They spoke of the power of Travellers working in prisons as positive role models, that is, Travellers who are peer support workers and who are in delivering training and peer mediation, Travellers who are mediators and the Traveller Counselling Service.  That is beginning to happen in prison.  They have asked that the IPS facilitate more Traveller role models to work in all the prisons.<\/p><p> They talked about the need for training workshops in all prisons where Travellers can learn practical skills to earn a living when they leave prison.  They shared their own positive experiences of education in prison, which was often their first positive experience of education, but they also spoke of the need to encourage other Travellers to access education.  They explained that many Travellers are reluctant because of their negative experience of school and the shame associated with that.<\/p><p> They spoke about protection.  They highlighted the need to explain to new committals that protection is not necessarily a safe place and can be a hostile and isolating place, and they should avoid going there unless it is absolutely necessary.  One Traveller man gave an example of how he had taken on that role of speaking to new committals in Castlerea Prison.  They talked about punishment and stopping visits and telephone calls as a punishment for prisoners and explained how that also punishes innocent children.  They discussed the need for special arrangements for prisoners with larger than average families to maintain contact with their families.<\/p><p> Finally, they gave positive examples of how trauma-informed therapies helped them to turn their lives around.  I have circulated very short recordings of the men speaking about those issue.  I am happy to discuss any of that this morning.<\/p><p> I will conclude with some priorities for the Travellers in Prison Initiative, the first of which is around ethnic equality monitoring.  We have begun the journey of gathering accurate data about Travellers in the criminal justice system and I acknowledge the commitment of the IPS, the Probation Service and the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, IASIO, to engage in this process.<\/p><p> I thank Pavee Point for its support in developing and delivering the training to staff who will be collecting the data.  It is really important that staff asking the question about ethnicity are trained to explain the purpose of the question.  Gathering accurate information is not an end in itself, however.  The agencies here today and the TPI must work together to try to scrutinise the data and come up with workable solutions to understand and address any negative outcomes for Travellers compared to the general population that the data reports.<\/p><p> Our second area is around services in prison and probation.  Again, the agencies here today will talk about how they have tried to adapt their services to ensure that Travellers can avail of the full benefits of their services.  We welcome this but we seek a commitment to resource this work across all prison sites and in the Probation Service, for example, the development of guidelines on pre-sentence reports for Travellers.<\/p><p> Our third priority is around peer support.  Travellers spoke about the impact it has when their peers work with them.  We are delighted that the IPS has mainstreamed peer support in four prisons and peer mediation training has been delivered in five prisons by the Traveller Mediation Service.  We need the support of the IPS to roll out peer support initiatives in all prisons, however, and to ensure that the Traveller Counselling Service will be resourced to ensure that it is more widely available to all Travellers in prison.<\/p><p> The final issue is around women in the criminal justice system.

As she said, I will focus on Traveller women.<\/p> <p>  Traveller women in prison are a particularly vulnerable group.  They are a forgotten, neglected group of women in the prison system, which reflects the racism, oppression and marginalisation Traveller women experience at wider societal and institutional levels.  The National Traveller Women's Forum, NTWF, has begun to focus on their needs following research in 2016, when the Travellers in Prison Initiative interviewed 12 Traveller women in prison, which gave us a better insight into how they ended up in prison and the issues they faced while in prison and post release.  Their honest stories make a compelling call for justice, rights and the action needed to bring about positive change in their lives.  That research in 2016 also highlighted that 22% of women in prison at that time were Traveller women.  Ms Costello highlighted the causes of over-representation of Travellers in prison.  The reality is that concrete action is needed to ensure that this trend is reversed.<\/p> <p>  The NTWF acknowledges the funding we receive from the Irish Prison Service, IPS, to deliver peer support in the D&oacute;chas Centre.  Through that work we have a better insight into the complexities of the women's circumstances.  While Traveller women in prison have much in common with other women, they experience additional layers of racism and oppression.  Many have experienced the trauma of close family bereavement through suicide, mental health problems and drug addiction, with some progressing from prescribed drugs to illegal drugs.  There is also the issue of domestic violence, and many of the women grew up in care and now their own children are in care.  There are also the challenges and difficulties Traveller women face when engaging with the relevant services to attempt to reconnect with their children on release from prison if their children are in care or have gone into care as a result of the mother's prison sentence.  A number of women over recent years have highlighted that as a particularly difficult and challenging experience.<\/p> <p>  The women have identified the need for supports as soon as they come into contact with the criminal justice system.  These supports could include: information; help in linking with existing services - for example, mental health, addiction, family support or housing services; routes into employment to ensure routes out of poverty; and support to maintain contact with their family and children if they are in prison.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant need for equal access to education while in prison and a real need to ensure that culturally appropriate services are accessible to Traveller women in prison.  There also needs to be effective monitoring, as we have heard, of the ethnic data being collected across the prison systems to ensure that disproportional outcomes for Traveller women are addressed.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's public sector duty training needs to be implemented in its entirety in the prison system in order that we begin to see some eradication of the discrimination and racism Travellers experience in the prison system every single day, which needs to be addressed and in respect of which the relevant actors need to be held to account.  These supports could help to divert Travellers away from prison and to navigate the prison system if they are imprisoned, particularly in respect of the care of their children.  These supports could also help to address mental health issues and addictions and support Travellers' reintegration back into their communities after prison.  We know there is a particular stigma for women when they leave prison, and that is very relevant to Traveller women.<\/p> <p>  Funding is needed to resource this work.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla recognise the need for a worker to undertake this type of wider support work and have made an application to the European Social Fund for funding.  We also need the support of the IPS and the Probation Service in this area and an expansion of this work.<\/p> <p>  A number of Traveller women have told us that they have spoken to the Inspector of Prisons about perceived unfair treatment in prison.  Some of the women have told the National Traveller Women's Forum that they feel let down that although they spoke out about the way they were being treated, the report has never been published.  We seek the publication of the report.  Women in the D&oacute;chas Centre over the years have also highlighted the role of the Garda from the point of engagement with the criminal justice system to the major difficulty surrounding early release options.  They very much depend on relationships with garda&iacute; which, as we know, in the context of Travellers, are far from positive.  As the committee heard Ms Costello say, in the internal Garda study in 2020 on attitudes towards Travellers not a single front-line garda surveyed had a favourable view of the community.  That speaks for itself regarding Travellers' negative experiences of the policing system in Ireland.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to raise our concerns here.  It appears that our prisons are not safe for women, so we must watch this space.  I look forward to the discussion in the question-and-answer session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":986,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Joyce.

The Irish Penal Reform Trust is Ireland's leading non-governmental organisation campaigning for rights in the penal system and progressive reform of Irish penal policy.  Our core message is that a just and humane penal system that protects and promotes human rights, equality and social justice will contribute to safer and more equal communities for everyone.<\/p> <p>  In recent years we have conducted research on minority groups in the penal system, including women, Travellers, LGBT people, older people and people with disabilities in prison.  Of most relevance are the findings of our 2014 report, Travellers in the Irish Prison System, along with our current research project on access to rights for migrants and minority ethnic groups in the penal system, which is due for publication in early 2022.  It is important to highlight intersectionality when we discuss Travellers' experiences in prison - for example, the position of an older Traveller woman with disabilities in prison.  This need to incorporate an understanding of multiple and intersectional forms of discrimination has been addressed by the UN Human Rights Council, which emphasises the need to incorporate effective approaches in laws, policies and programmes.<\/p> <p>  As an overarching point, Travellers are over-represented in both the prison system and among people engaged by the Probation Service, but representation among the staff of both services, and indeed the Judiciary and other parts of the justice system, is extremely low.  According to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, these are possible indicators of racial discrimination and wider social issues that must be addressed.  Both Ms Costello and Ms Joyce have already articulated this very well.<\/p> <p>  We have focused on three key issues in our presentation.  The first is the importance of data recording and ethnic equality monitoring.  This is the first step towards addressing inequalities faced by minority ethnic groups caught up in the criminal justice system.  There is a need for comprehensive and robust ethnic monitoring by all relevant agencies.  Within the prison system in particular, ethnic equality monitoring is essential to ensure - for example: equitable access to education, training and work in prison; equal access to incentivised regimes; and equal access to early release programmes.  Such monitoring is also needed to inform provision of appropriate services, including healthcare and mental healthcare.  Ethnic equality monitoring also plays a critical role in protecting against potential differences - for example: in the use of restricted regimes, including solitary confinement; use of force and control and restraint techniques; and use of safety observation cells and close supervision cells.<\/p> <p>  I echo Ms Costello in that the IPRT welcomes the actions taken by the Irish Prison Service, including the introduction of an ethnic identifier and the collection of anonymised data and the peer-led training that has supported that roll-out.  We are concerned, however, that these data should be adequately recorded, analysed and made publicly available.  Without such data being made available, any disparities in treatment and potentially discriminatory practices cannot be identified and addressed.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, our first recommendation is that the Department of Justice should ensure that ethnic equality monitoring is adequately carried out across the criminal justice system using the ethnic categories developed by the Central Statistics Office.<\/p><p>The information, appropriately anonymised, should be made publicly available to support further research and evidence-informed policy and practice.<\/p><p> The second key issue is implementation of the public sector duty.  Under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, there is a positive duty on all public bodies to eliminate discrimination and protect the human rights of staff and persons to whom they provide services.  The Irish Prison Service, IPS, consistently demonstrates its commitment to the equality and human rights duty in its reporting.  This is manifest primarily through staff training and policy.  However reports of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, and recent public disclosures regarding social media activity, suggest a small number of staff engage in discriminatory behaviour and racist abuse.  Mandatory anti-racism training for staff should be reviewed, updated and repeated regularly, and members of the groups affected should be engaged in the development and delivery of this training.  This must be met with positive action by the IPS to ensure that its training on human rights and equality issues is implemented in the prison estate on a practical day-to-day basis.  Furthermore the current review of the Prison Rules 2007 is an opportunity to insert a positive obligation to eliminate discrimination, and thereby make it unambiguous that the rules must be implemented in a manner compliant with the public sector duty.  Our second recommendation is that the IPS should ensure that the revised Prison Rules include an explicit statement of commitment to eliminate discrimination.<\/p><p> Our third and final recommendation relates to an effective complaints system.  IPRT's forthcoming research, due for publication in early 2022, finds that the prison complaints system is ineffective in addressing complaints concerning racism.  This echoes general findings by both the CPT and the Office of the Inspector of Prisons that the current complaints system is not fit for purpose.  The Department of Justice and the IPS should ensure that the new complaints policy is rolled out with urgency so that that all complaints, particularly those relating to racial discrimination, are fairly and adequately addressed.  This is critical to fostering a prison culture where everyone feels protected from discrimination and has confidence that he or she will be treated fairly.  The IPS should also introduce a system for compiling statistics on all complaints made across the prison estate, and their outcomes, as recommended by the CPT.  Our third recommendation is that the IPS and the Department of Justice should work together to ensure that the new internal prisoner complaints mechanism is introduced before the end of 2021 and consider how the complaint system can address and investigate allegations of racism in an effective manner.  <\/p><p> I conclude by thanking the committee for its invitation and its attention to these issues and I look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Barry Owens, of the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#E00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":990,"content":"<p>The Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, IASIO, thanks the Chair and the members of the committee for this invite and welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Joint Committee on Key Issues facing the Traveller Community.  IASIO provides front-line services to members of the Traveller community in prisons and as part of the Probation Service in the community.  It has been doing so since 2000, with IASIO becoming a separate criminal justice organisation in 2012.  Our participation today is based on that operational experience.  IASIO provides three main services, the linkage service which is funded by the Probation Service, the resettlement service funded by the IPS and the gate service which is also funded by the IPS.  The linkage service is a community-based, employment related, guidance and placement service specifically designed for people in the criminal justice system.  It assesses a person&rsquo;s distance from the labour market and identifies any barriers to progression that may exist.  Working with the person it identifies realistic goals around training, education and employment and supports the person in achieving those goals.  The linkage service is delivered through training and employment officers, TEOs, of which there are currently 17, equating to 15.6 whole-time equivalent posts, attached to the probation teams around the country.  Between 2016 and 2020 the linkage service received 8,498 referrals.<\/p> <p>  The gate service is the prison based equivalent of the linkage service, likewise assessing distance from the labour market, identifying barriers to progression and supporting people in accessing training and employment opportunities post their release in the community.  The gate service is embedded in the prison multidisciplinary process and is an important part of the release process in participating prisons.  There are currently eight TEOs, six whole-time equivalents, in the gate service.  Between 2016 and 2020 the gate service received 4,122 referrals.  Combined, between 2016 and 2020 the linkage and gate placements for those referrals were 5,027, with 971 in education, 2,056 in training and 2,000 in employment. <\/p> <p>  The resettlement service supports people in their immediate release.  It helps them create realistic resettlement plans while in prison and provides access to essential supports around housing, welfare and medical cards as part of their release.  The resettlement service is the main point of contact between the IPS and local authorities, the national medical card unit and the Department of Social Protection.  Like the gate service it is embedded in the prison multidisciplinary review process.  The resettlement service currently has 12 resettlement co-ordinators, 11 whole-time equivalents.  Between 2016 and 2020 the resettlement service received 6,168 referrals of which there were 1,731 housing applications, 1,979 medical card applications and 1,539 welfare supports.  <\/p> <p>  IASIO&rsquo;s operational services are based on general provision.  They are available to all people on probation if deemed suitable by the referring probation officer, as is the case for the linkage service, and open to all sentenced prisoners with some sentence length criteria, as is the case for the gate and resettlement services.  As such IASIO&rsquo;s services are available to members of the Traveller community in prison and as part of probation supervision in the community.  Between 2016 and 2020 across IASIO&rsquo;s three main operational services there were 1,502 referrals for Travellers, of which 1,287 were male and 215 female.  In total 306 placements were made, 62 being in education, 195 in training and 49 in employment-related activities.  There were 14 in paid employment. <\/p> <p>  With respect to work with the Traveller community specifically, we liaise with various Traveller organisations in the community on an ongoing basis.  We are members of the Traveller in Prison Initiative, TPI.  We ran a significant groupwork programme, the midlands Traveller talk group in the Midlands Prison between 2015 and 2018 in partnership with Laois Traveller action group and the IPS, which provided important lessons for Traveller participation and programme organisation in prisons.  We have received training from Pavee Point in successfully introducing an ethnic identifier as part of our data collection process.  We have a co-operation agreement, facilitated through TPI and the IPS, with Traveller peer support workers covering Limerick, D&oacute;chas, Wheatfield and the Midlands Prisons, the aim of which is to improve engagement and outcomes for members of the Traveller community. <\/p> <p>  In preparing this submission IASIO colleagues were asked to note some of the issues they come across when working with members of the Traveller community.  They reported that trust can be an issue and must be developed over time; with the development of trust, engagement can be very positive.  Also noted was that some Travellers decline the service, that is after it is explained to them.  With respect to working in prisons, even if engagement was good while in prison, there is often poor engagement post release.  It is difficult to maintain contact with members of the Traveller community post release.  Low literacy levels and low skill or educational attainment are common.  Complex presenting issues can be evident, related to addiction and mental health issues.  Travellers often seem reluctant to attend prison education because of reported bad experiences of mainstream education.  Training and employment officers report that it is very difficult to organise employment placements.  Labour market participation is very low.  Not all Travellers express an interest in mainstream employment.  The majority of placements for Travellers are on CE schemes, probation projects and community training programmes.  While in prison Travellers are less likely to present as homeless.  <\/p> <p>  IASIO continues to develop its services for people in prison and on probation and recognise as part of that development a need to better understand engagement with members of the Traveller community.  We have committed to fully implementing the ethnic identifier and to reviewing as part of our current strategic commitments the cultural fit of our services with respect to Travellers.  We also aim to co-deliver with Traveller peer support workers an IASIO groupwork programme called Changing Course, the hope here being that it facilitates Traveller participation.  That concludes my opening statement and once again I thank the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":991,"content":"<p>I will now go to members.

They were detailed and informative.  They also show that the Travelling community in the Prison Service are treated the same as they are in the community, or even worse.  We have figures showing how high the population in the Prison Service is but do we know how many reoffend?  Is there a figure for that, for both men and women?  I would be interested in that.  I am also interested in the link between petty crime leading to further crimes, relating to drugs or anything like that, after Travelling men and women go into prison and the effect that has due to linking in with other harder criminals within the prison system.  What are the crimes that Traveller women end up in prison for?  Are they petty crimes?  I would be interested in the types of crimes that they are being put into prison for.  Between the gate and linkage services there were approximately 12,600 referrals.  Of that, the combined linkage and gate placements were 5,027.  That is approximately 40% of those referrals going into education, employment, etc.  Mr. Owens made several points about why Travellers coming out of prison do not engage with those services.  How much linkage does the Irish Traveller Movement have with those members of the Travelling community that come out of prison?  It looks like if they go to the referrals they are in the net but there are many of them who are not in the net.  Is there any sort of capture after that situation?  Is the recommendation for an effective complaints system in hand?  Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide said that the Prison Service and the Department of Justice should work together to ensure that the new internal prisoner complaint mechanism is introduced before the end of 2021.  Is it in hand or is it imminent?  What can we do as legislators to assist that being put into place?

The situation from prison to community, which I think is what the Deputy was asking about, is different.  We find it very difficult to stay connected with people as they move from prison to the community.  We do not fully understand that but that is quite a challenge and it is something we have discussed before with partners.  The feedback and what we are experiencing show that even if somebody engages well in prison, we often lose them in the community.  I am talking about very good engagement in the prison.  The Traveller workshop I mentioned as part of my opening statement had very good engagement and it led to very interesting things in the prison.  That group identified its own training.  A furniture recycling workshop was developed from it, which they themselves identified, and the IPS provided and paid for it.  They went through that and it was all very democratically done and participation and engagement was excellent.  However, we still lost track of those people as they moved to the community, so there is a question there.  That is a challenge for us and there is work that needs to be done there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Owens"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":994,"content":"<p>On the issue of reoffending, we do not have those figures.  I have come across numerous Travellers who have been in and out of the prison system and we use the term \"revolving door\" because those were the words they used.  They leave prison without supports and they are back in again and do not get the support they need while they are in prison.  Those supports would include trauma-informed therapies, skills that could help them to earn a living when they come out of prison, addiction services and so on.  If the data are analysed, we can look at issues around reoffending.  That data could be extracted.<\/p> <p>  As regards crimes for women, according to the research we did a lot of them were minor enough.  They were imprisoned for driving offences, shoplifting or a number of crimes linked to addiction.  When women described their stories, they spoke about the level of trauma around close family members and suicide, all their bereavements, moving on to prescribed drugs and then that leading into harder drugs.

Some of them feel they are on the petty crime end of it.  Some of the driving offences are driving without tax or insurance but sometimes these are first offences and the women felt that a non-custodial sentence would have addressed the level of the crime, as opposed to a custodial sentence.  There is a strong sense from many of the women we have engaged with in the D&oacute;chas Centre that it is one option for a Traveller in the criminal justice system and another outcome for a non-Traveller, where there are parallels in the crime that has been committed.  That is something that needs to be addressed because too many Travellers, including Traveller women, are ending up with custodial sentences where a non-custodial sentence could have addressed the issue.  That would also have ensured that the issues around the revolving door policy or practice could be addressed quicker with supports outside.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on one or two of the questions that were asked, particularly around engagement with supports on leaving prison that may not be within the Traveller organisations and are more linked to the prisons.  Some of the women we have engaged with in the D&oacute;chas Centre are clearly saying that they do not see themselves in the responses of any of those services.  I am not saying that work is not being done to look at how we can make these spaces more culturally appropriate, where they feel that there is something for them in it.  Work is beginning to be done in that regard but that is something that has come up.  Women have left the prison and gone to the service but say they did not get anything from it.  Again, where Traveller organisations are engaging and trying to support, that is one part of a piece of work.<\/p><p>They are so stretched for resources and looking at trying to address other issues and this is just an additional piece of work.  Still, they are trying to engage and support Travellers who are re-engaging in the community but there are a number of reasons.<\/p><p> A final point I would make is on paper, in relation to services and prison, it looks good.  The reality though is it is not the same in terms of how Travellers and Traveller women can access some of those supports and services.  Regarding some of the internal stuff around psychological supports, there is a real need to ensure culturally-appropriate psychological supports and other culturally-appropriate supports are being resourced within the prisons.  Some of that is starting to happen but it is a tiny aspect and it does need much more in terms of those critical supports when looking at issues of trauma that are really deep-seated.  The suicide rate for Traveller women is six times higher and it is seven times higher for Traveller men.  Few Travellers have not been directly affected by suicide of family members, friends or multiple persons.  A survey by the Community Foundation for Ireland, CFI, a few years ago showed that in all of the Travellers who engaged in that research, there were multiple layers where they were coming into contact with the community regarding suicide, including direct family members and friends.  Multiple layers of all those need to be addressed in these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":999,"content":"<p>Mr. Owens made a point around trust and it is a huge issue, especially for Travellers in prison.  It is for that reason we are saying that particularly for the Traveller women, we need one caseworker who will work with the women all the way along, that is, pre-imprisonment, during imprisonment and post-prison.  That person will introduce them and build confidence with the services.  We are not looking for new services for them but sometimes they need that introduction to Mr. Owens and other people like him to be assured this service is not going to discriminate against them and it will work for them.

I thank the Deputy for the questions.  The importance of ethnic equality monitoring comes through from the inputs here.  For example, the Self-Harm Assessment and Data Analysis, SADA, studies into self-harm incidence in prisons do not track ethnic equality monitoring.  What we know is women are more than eight times more likely to engage in self-harm and people on remand are two and a half times more likely than people serving a sentence but we cannot match that up with what Ms Joyce and Ms Costello have so eloquently described to the committee.  Another example to echo what Ms Costello said about the prison recidivism rates is that we do not have that breakdown.  It would be so important .  However, we do know people sentenced to prison for between three and six months prior to their release had the highest probability of reoffending within one year of release and, therefore, the highest rates of early reoffending are among those imprisoned for short sentences which, by definition, are for less serious offences.  This again just adds evidence to support what Ms Costello and Ms Joyce are saying.<\/p> <p>  On women in the D&oacute;chas Centre, we were struck that in the 2019 Office of the Inspector of Prisons report, at the time of her visit she said 24% of women in the centre were Travellers, which is very high.  We also know that before the pandemic between 25% and 30% of women under sentence in prison were again serving short sentences of less than 12 months.  This is in contrast to men where it is in the region of 15%.  The numbers in prison have been reduced quite substantially in response to the pandemic.  We welcome that.  We hope it is not a short-term solution.  We hope it will be maintained in the future.  In September, 12% of all prisoners under sentence were serving sentences of less than 12 months.  We welcome that but it should go further.<\/p> <p>  The other issue we have not addressed here is the high number of women detained on remand, including Traveller women.  The IPS has done detailed analysis of this and perhaps it will be able to share it with the committee.  The Department of Justice has committed to examining this persistent use of prison.  In the region of three quarters of committals to prison under sentences every year are for sentences of less than 12 months, which means the legislation designed to increase the use of community-based sanctions as an alternative is not seeming effective but we do not know why.  It could relate to housing, mental health, addictions.  There is a range.  The Department is engaging in this review and we welcome that.  It is also examining the gender element to that as well, which is positive.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on the prison complaints point, in 2016, the then Inspector of Prisons, Judge Micheal Reilly, launched a report, the recommendations of which were accepted by then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Francis Fitzgerald MEP.  It said there was a need for overarching review of the prison complaints system and that the ombudsman should be introduced as an external appeals mechanism.  We know some work has been undertaken in the Prison Service in terms of training and putting different systems in place.  However, the new, revised complaints system has not yet been published.  There were commitments made about the end of 2019 and the end of 2020.  Our understanding now is the hold-up is because it requires an amendment to the prison rules and that the backlog of legislation, perhaps pandemic-related, is the reason for the delay.  At any time, but particularly during a pandemic when there are fewer feet walking the prison landings, we think that should be an absolute priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their contributions.  I found them to be interesting.  There is much food for thought.  One of the big problems, based on the comments of Ms Joyce, is the follow-up services and having a proper case worker following this up.  That applies whether it is in the prison itself, as people may not be engaging properly for different reasons, but especially when they get out.  It is about how can we tie them into some services.  Does Pavee Point have a role in dealing with that or directing a lot of these people coming outside, because that is always going to be very hard?<\/p> <p>  The other thing I found interesting was racism within prison.  We know there is racism outside prison but by God it must be an awful lot worse in prison.  Therefore the complaints procedure, as was said, needs to be much more robust.  It needs to be looked at and acts of racism need to be recorded so we get a picture of how bad it is.  That is not just for Travellers but for everyone, though we especially need to get a picture of how that plays out.  I think it was said that by 2021 there would be more done to address that issue and I would like to hear a bit more about that.  The media and especially Facebook can be awful.  We have seen how much damage they can do.  We have seen the way much of the media portrays Travellers but then when one reads some of the stuff put up on Facebook, it is absolutely appalling.<\/p> <p>  I was wondering about education.  Are we getting people to tie in fairly well in education, particularly in prison?  Are they tying in to the services that are available there or are we struggling there?<\/p> <p>  Are Travellers kept together as much as possible in prison or is it a case of them generally being mixed into the prison population?  Is it a policy to try to keep people within their own community close to each other?  I would like to hear a bit more about that.<\/p> <p>  The mental health issue is obviously a major problem.<\/p><p>I presume that we have psychiatrists who attend to people with serious mental health issues.  I would love to know how much they engage.  Are we fairly active in looking at this?

There are some really good teachers in prisons who work with them.  We do not support the idea of segregated classes for Travellers or anything of that nature.  Peer support can be very strong.  If one Traveller attends school, he or she will encourage others to come down.  That is often the way.  They assure them that it is not like school was because that is where they had the negative association and the shame and failure associated with it.  Where it works, it works really well but the issue is that many Travellers are not coming down to school at all because they do not see the value of it.  They are not convinced that they will not have that same experience.  Sometimes they do not see the benefits of it because they do not think it will have a significant impact.  As a result, we need to do a lot more work.  June Edwards, who is a Traveller liaison teacher with the ETB, will speak later in the afternoon.  It has piloted initiatives across prisons in Dublin where each prison has a teacher dedicated to putting the spotlight on Travellers.  This has been hugely successful.  It is where they just encourage them down.  They have adapted some of the curriculum to make it more relevant to Travellers and have included stories about Travellers in literacy, but we need a lot more.  There is insufficient focus on literacy in prisons.  This is where, unfortunately, many Travellers in prison are.  They need support in respect of literacy.<\/p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide probably has more information on psychiatry but I know there are long waiting lists to access counselling services.  Again, at our most recent conference, Travellers spoke about the harmful impact until the Traveller Counselling Service came in and how they felt somebody understood them and was someone they could talk to.  That is why we really want to encourage more of that.  Again, where they access the services, they are usually very good but it is the waiting list that is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>It is a very damning indictment of our education system if the first positive experience of education for many Travellers is in prison.  That aside, it still does not mean it has the critical outcomes that are needed.  Good work is happening but there is also much more that can be done.  I know from the work we did in D&oacute;chas that some of the women will say that they go down and the class is full or if they have to wait for another service before they go to the school and the lists are full, they cannot get in.  Again, it is on paper as being a service but having real accessibility is another kettle of fish.<\/p> <p>  Another point about education is that it is really important that educators in prison are not steering Travellers into particular types of courses that are stereotypical or do not challenge them to address what they need to address.  We have seen that where Travellers have availed of opportunities within prison and externally, they have excelled but there is not enough of that.  There is a degree to which they will be steered towards a certain type of course, so it is important that some of that stuff is addressed.<\/p> <p>  Regarding some of the points about racism and the online level of racism, when it comes to Travellers, online racism and hate are at a whole other level.  As we all know in this country, the legislation was not fit for purpose in terms of addressing this matter.  Hopefully, with the new hate crime and hate speech legislation that is being progressed through the system, it will be addressed.  It also needs to address the issues facing Travellers who are incarcerated in prisons but it will not.  Recently, we saw a private Facebook page involving former and current prison officers and garda&iacute; that contained hate and racism towards Travellers.  These people are working in prisons and are in direct contact with Travellers.  Accountability is another critical issue.  Whatever mechanisms in the new hate crime and hate speech Bills that are introduced need to take account of those in the prison system and ensure accountability.  These are agents of the State.  We should not be talking about the issue of discrimination and racism towards Travellers in prison.  I know there is a level of it from other prisoners but it should not exist in those who are governing.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for targeted supports and resources to address the issues that have created the disproportionate number of Travellers in prison.  Having said that, it is really important we do not go down the route of a segregated or separate system because that has never served Travellers well in this country no matter what form it has taken, be it in education or anything else.  It is really important that there are targeted measures to address particular issues, particularly the experience of racism and discrimination.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the complaints system, we have had numerous discussions with some of the women in D&oacute;chas who felt they could not or would not make complaints because it was not safe.  There was a real fear of it being traced back to a particular individual.  If confidentiality cannot be assured in a new complaints system, there is something wrong.  I know that there was a CCTV camera in D&oacute;chas close enough to where the complaint box was at one point.  No woman who is trying to make a complaint wants it to come back to her with consequences.  She would be very fearful about it.  There is a need to ensure more culturally appropriate responses.  Regarding the point about mental health supports within the system, there are services but there are large waiting lists.  Where we have seen services that can come in and respond directly to the needs and allow Travellers to see themselves recognised and their issues recognised - not just because they are Travellers - with specific services like the Traveller Counselling Service, they have had an impact but it is not enough and there needs to be more of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>We strongly welcome the regular publication of education data by the ETBs and the Prison Service.  In terms of mental health, we know from a question answered by the Minister in March that there were 1,200 people on the waiting list for access to a prison psychology service.<\/p><p>That is a third of the prison population.  That is a population that has, in any case, a higher prevalence of mental health issues.  Within that, one has members of the Traveller community who have much higher levels of self-harm and mental health issues.  It is that intersectional piece that really needs to be examined.  <\/p><p> We know that an additional sum of just over &euro;1 million was assigned in the budget Estimates just now for the Prison Service to support increased provision of mental health services in prison.  In part of our budget submission with Mental Health Reform, we had sought &euro;5.5 million because that was our estimate of the need.  That funding is certainly welcome but is probably not enough.<\/p><p> A positive measure is the establishment of the high-level task force on mental health, addictions and imprisonment established by the two Ministers across the Departments of Justice and Health, together with the two Ministers of State with responsibility for mental health and the national drugs strategy, respectively.  It is that interagency piece which is probably the most hopeful, particularly their commitment to there being actions.  The ethnic equality monitoring piece would be a very specific action that that task force might undertake.<\/p><p> On disability, the IPRT published a large-scale research report in 2020 on people with disabilities in prison.  I wish to acknowledge the openness of the Irish Prison Service in letting the researchers in because the findings were quite dismaying.  The service was very open and really wants to address this issue.  The report examined disability across all four forums of physical, intellectual, sensory and psychosocial disabilities.  Broadly, the recommendations were across the inappropriateness of the physical prison environment and what needs to happen there.  On communications, it is about ensuring that people with disabilities understand the prison rules, for example, and are not at risk of unintentionally breaking prison rules and ending up being punished without really understanding what they are doing wrong.  High emphasis should be put on awareness and training among staff.  Again, this also comes back to this point of involving peers in the development and delivery of this training.  I would be very happy to send a copy of this report to the joint committee following this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I will mention a number of points that occurred to me after Deputy Ellis&rsquo;s statements and questions.<br\/><br\/>One thing is that we should consider sentencing.  Earlier in this discussion we talked about the many short-term sentences that Travellers serve.  We have to be practical about what is possible within a short-term sentence.  If people are serving a continuous sentence or a number of short ones, with not too much time in the community, then it is limited as to what can be achieved in a prison.  It is a very disruptive kind of existence.  As to the type of access to services, if somebody is serving a number of short-term sentences continually, what can be achieved by an education unit or by a service like ours is quite limited.  This is especially the case if one thinks about something like literacy.  It is hard to learn to read and write and we just forget about what it was like.  This is probably a very difficult thing and probably takes a long time to do. <br\/><br\/>What is achievable?  It suggests to me that prison should not be seen as separate but as a completely continuous mechanism between prison and community.  What we do in prison needs to be reinforced in the community.  Of all of the things mentioned today in Traveller supports, access to services is very important.  There should be some plan which is not just about the prison but is shared with the community.  This idea of shared plans, of people leaving prison and going to the community and <i>vice versa<\/i>becomes very important.  It means that somebody else can take this up on the outside.  We have a protocol referral agreement between ourselves and Intreo, for instance, and we are trying to standardise what we collect and what we share and how we share.  This is a small thing but it is useful.<br\/><br\/>We have to think about what is possible in the time available to us and how this happens in terms of the rotation.  We should be realistic about what is achievable for those people because to say that one should read and write also is perhaps to introduce too much to them.  We should identify smaller milestones towards everything, such as employment, being literate and numerate, whatever the case may be.  There are very interesting steps in the process which are valuable and if one recognises this in the person, one gets buy-in as one goes along.<br\/><br\/>Guidance is also an issue.  Guidance for us in the linkage and gate services, in the first instance, opens up the space to imagine alternatives.  It is often the first time that anybody has been asked what they want and what stands in their way.  It is certainly not about being pushed down a particular way.  Often, and this is true of the general prison population, it has very conservative or stereotyped types of ideas about progress and success, based upon their community, to which they might aspire.  <br\/><br\/>You are working through all of that but for the gate service in the prisons, since this is what we are talking about, that space is opened up to an imagined alternative and then the question, and that is a pathway.  The question then becomes how does one do it and what practical steps are necessary to achieve that.  <br\/><br\/>It does work. There is one case of a person from the Traveller community who is now accessing Sligo IT and that was following a guidance process.  That shows that it is possible but it just does not happen often enough.<br\/><br\/>On education units, based on my previous comments about the sentence link and so on, these are obviously central to the whole thing and of great importance.  They do not, however, operate in a vacuum but are linked to the rest of the prison.  They should be seen as the centre of the wheel on which there are spokes.  We should all be feeding into education.  There are so many opportunities and educational moments within prison that we need to share responsibility for.  Guidance itself is an educational process, if one thinks about it, as somebody is exploring what is possible.  It is so important because if one thinks about the future and one identifies something that animates the person and which that person thinks for the first time ever is possible, then that organises how he or she sees the present.  It will in a way change that person&rsquo;s perception, perhaps, about what he or she might think about addiction and support services, which the person may see differently in this case.  This is something that we need to develop further but is possible.<br\/><br\/>There is a question about segregation which is a very difficult issue.  I am not quite sure what the policy from the IPS is on segregation.  I believe that some amount of self-segregation takes place which may be because of comfort; I am not quite sure.  It seems to me that members of the Traveller community are mostly together in the prison which is something to be dealt with.  <br\/><br\/>In the group work programme, one talks about creating a safe space in which members of the Traveller community might talk about things and this is something where we could provide an opportunity for Travellers to do that and at the same time not corral them into education settings, say, in a classroom just for Travellers or perhaps to channel ways down.  <br\/><br\/>We need to get that balance between the things.  Sometimes we need group work which is just for Travellers because there are issues that pertain to them and at other times general provision needs to be mixed for some things but we need to be clear about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>We are in the 60-second question time now because we have approximately four to five minutes left.<\/p> <p>  What we have heard all afternoon has been very interesting.  But for literally two to three minutes, I would like to come at this issue from a slightly different point of view.  Is prison the answer in the first place?  Could we do a great deal more through community service and if I might say so, not only community service in the conventional sense but community education?  In other words, if somebody has reoffended in a small way then he or she has to attend a process of community education rather than community service, or diversion programmes to put it another way.  This would be to deal with people who are being sentenced for two or three months who should really not wind up in prison.<\/p> <p>  The next question, and I would like a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to these, is that the idea of prisons, as I understand it, is for the safety of society.  If people are going in and coming out repeatedly and doing worse things and coming back in for longer sentences, this idea is certainly not achieving that aim.<\/p> <p>  The next thing is try to help people to reform or to avoid crime in the future.  Is our prison model actually serving the purposes for which prison is determined to be for?  <\/p> <p>  I have a further question, and as I said these all require \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers.  We can tease these out in the second part but I believe it is something that we need to reflect upon.  Are we arriving at a syndrome whereby people serve sentences for three months and then for six months or, in other words, that the sentences actually get longer and longer and in some cases, the offences become ever more serious and therefore, this has a negative effect rather than a positive one?  Is there a better way of doing this that would avoid this syndrome?  <\/p> <p>  Specifically in relation to women in prison, and Traveller women in particular, should there be an open prison?<\/p><p>I seek a \"Yes\" or \"No\" on that.  Is homelessness the real issue for some, and would the requirement be more for sheltered accommodation than conventional prison?<\/p><p> The third issue is one we have not discussed much.  When fathers are taken to prison and particularly when mothers are taken to prison, what effect does that have on the children?  Is it negative or positive?  I seek \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers as I have to curtail this session and want to finish it at 3.05 p.m.  We can continue this discussion.

There is a need for an open prison.  The prison system has to do more in terms of community service and community education.  It needs to do more to keep people with lesser sentences for minor crimes out of the prison system so it does not become a revolving door for them in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Yes, issues such as homelessness, poverty and negative experiences of education where they have not had opportunities with regard to third level and ongoing education or employment of course have impacts for women in prison.  I echo what has already been said.  The point about the intergenerational impact in regard to the cycle of prison is very real for some.  Certainly, parents in prison, either one or the other or both, can only be a negative experience for their children.  We have seen it time and again when Traveller women are talking about their experiences in prison and the families and children they are leaving at home.  It is a very significant issue.  When they have children who may already be in care, that will create additional barriers on their release to trying to engage with their children, or if the children have gone into care as a direct result of them going into prison.  It is not about ensuring the care of children; it is about ensuring contact with parents and a service that is not approaching it from a perspective where there is discrimination and racism in terms of how services are delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I will be fast.  Prison should be a sanction of last resort and reserved for serious offenders.  The emphasis should be on exhausting non-custodial alternatives in the community.  As a society, we seem to have no problem sending people back to prison repeatedly.  The same approach could be taken to community service.  If one fails once, the next alternative should not be prison but to try it again.  There is a need for more examination of the disproportionate outcomes and difference for women.  For example, the community return programme is a very successful programme whereby prisoners serving long sentences can return to the community at the 50% mark to complete their sentences in the community.  The statistics are slightly out of date, but approximately 90% of males on the programme successfully complete the programme but there is a 60% return to prison rate for women.  That is a big differential and is most likely linked to complex issues such as housing, mental health and addictions, but that has to be examined.  It should not just be examined but also addressed.  The findings must be acted on.<\/p> <p>  \"Yes\" is the answer to an open prison for women, but only within the frame of prison as a last resort.  What we do not want is another institution opened that is another residential centre for women who would be better responded to in the community.  There is absolute policy consensus that offending by women generally is better responded to in the community.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will address the question about the children of people in prison.  It is very complex and it is important that we do not talk about it as if it is a predictor, because children are different with different resilience and so forth.  What is common among these children is experience of trauma, separation, stigma and poverty.  We must support those children to have better outcomes in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>Prison is a last resort.

Today, there are 3,838 persons in custody.  People in prisons, while isolated for a period of time, remain an integral part of our communities.  Prisons are an extension of our communities and issues that impact people in the wider community also affect those in custody in the same way.<\/p> <p>  Diversity exists within our population.  Today, there are people in custody from the ages of 18 to 88.  There are almost 600 people in prison who are not identified as Irish, with more than 200 prisoners from outside Europe.  Relevant to today&rsquo;s discussion, we know that a disproportionately large number of people in custody recognise themselves as Travellers.<\/p> <p>  The director general of the Irish Prison Service, Ms Caron McCaffrey, attended the recent Travellers in Prison Initiative, TPI, national conference and spoke on behalf of the Irish Prison Service.  Ms McCaffrey's feedback was that she appreciated the opportunity to hear directly about the lived experiences of Travellers who have been in prison.  The powerful messages she heard about their experiences can help us to move forward to become a more aware and inclusive prison service.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge our partners in the TPI, the St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green Trust and the Probation Service and commend the co-operative approach taken to moving forward the issues that arise for Travellers in the criminal justice sector.  Through our partnership over the past six years, we have taken some positive steps forward.  Peer support services have been developed in four prisons and mediation in eight prisons, which we hope to develop further now that Covid-19 restrictions are reducing.  Traveller liaison teachers have been identified, especially in the Dublin area, to support greater access to prison education services and the adaptation of education services for Travellers.  Traveller pride events have been hosted and awareness training was introduced for new prison staff on the issues arising for Travellers and areas of discrimination.  Electronic means have been developed to capture ethnicity information in a systematic way.  Traveller volunteers were trained for the Red Cross programme in prisons.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service acknowledges that we have more work to do with regard to equality and diversity and to prevent discrimination in our service.  In late 2019, a new equality, diversity and inclusion lead for the Irish Prison Service, Mr. S&eacute;amus Beirne, was appointed and he joins us today.  Mr. Beirne's role has recently been broadened to include responsibility for services for Travellers in prison.  Broadening our knowledge of the lived experiences of prisoners from all backgrounds in relation to their experience of the Irish prison system will form an integral part of the equality and diversity brief in 2022.  The Irish Prison Service intends to carry out a survey of prisoners in 2022 to get a greater insight to the lived experiences, so we can introduce targeted local and national responses in areas where we need to develop.  Moreover, the Irish Prison Service is continuing to raise awareness amongst staff about Traveller issues.  Mr. Beirne recently commenced a number of roadshows with staff in prisons and we expect that this is the beginning of a number of continuing conversations with staff on this area.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service has set out to deliver bespoke initiatives for prisoners targeting different groups such as older prisoners and younger prisoners.  There are a number of specific initiatives aimed at supporting members of the Traveller community in our prisons.  I will mention some of these briefly.  A successful mediation programme has been in operation in Castlerea Prison since 2016.  This programme is a partnership between the midlands Traveller conflict mediation service, the Red Cross, the Travellers in Prison Initiative and Castlerea Prison school.  It is a hugely successful programme aimed at conflict awareness.<\/p> <p>  Mediation is an effective way of resolving disputes and can resolve even the most complex, intractable disputes.  The programme has since been extended to other prisons, including Midlands Prison, Loughan House, the D&oacute;chas Centre and Cork Prison.  While the roll-out has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of prison education centres have expressed a willingness to introduce a similar programme in the future.<\/p><p>Throughout each sentence, we must take steps to ensure we give prisoners the best possible opportunity to reintegrate themselves into society by imparting life skills to put them back on the road to being good citizens again.  Prisons are full of poor people.  They are not just poor economically, but also poor emotionally, educationally, socially and in the context of their health status.  Many have difficulty regulating their emotions.  Typically, people committed to custody are young men aged 18 to 35 who have fallen out of education or training and who have fallen out of society into prison.  The most effective intervention with someone in prison is the relationship with staff.  This builds relationships.  The relationship is an instrument to take offenders into a space where they begin to own some of their behaviours and take responsibility.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will mention the first aid programme known as the Red Cross programme.  In recent years, this peer-led programme has seen success in our prisons.  It was introduced in 2009 under a partnership between the Irish Red Cross, the Irish Prison Service, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the Probation Service.  This innovative programme trains prisoners as Red Cross volunteers who develop projects aimed at improving their community, the prison community.  The idea is to learn in the classroom and educate their peers on the landings.  The notion of peer-to-peer education among a prisoner population is a powerful one since prisoners will listen to other prisoners before they will listen to prison staff.  To date, more than 1,500 prisoners have been trained in the Red Cross programme and many of these have been members of the Traveller community, who note that the peer-led approach is particularly attractive to them.  It also allows the opportunity for Travellers in prison to take a more proactive role in looking after their health and well-being and the well-being of others in their prison community.<br\/><br\/>I will highlight some of the initiatives undertaken.  With the Red Cross, we have developed a conflict resolution workshop in Castlerea, which is facilitated by Traveller men and aims to develop intervention skills and address some of the commonest issues that can lead to Traveller-on-Traveller violence in prisons.  Volunteer groups in many prisons have participated in projects aimed at encouraging Travellers to attend school and to speak openly about their experiences of school in prison.  During the Covid pandemic, work by the Red Cross volunteers with Travellers in prisons has been important in respect of vaccine awareness and promotion.  Peer educators serve as positive role models that reinforce behavioural change, and peer education has been recognised as an important tool to educate populations that are hard to reach.  To this end, work is ongoing to facilitate a Red Cross course within an identified Traveller group in the wider community.  Working with our colleagues in the Probation Service, we hope to identify Traveller Red Cross volunteers who have left prison and who will work with Travellers in the community though the Travellers in Prison Initiative.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly mention the opening of the equine unit in Castlerea Prison.  This is an exciting and innovative collaboration between the Irish Prison Service and the horse community.  The programme being run in the equine centre, which is the first of its kind in Europe, will target all prisoners, but early indications have pointed to a significant level of interest in the programme from Traveller men in Castlerea and in other locations.  The programme commenced in August and prisoners from Castlerea Prison attend the equine centre, which is outside the walls, daily.  We currently have seven horses and are engaged in the horse care and welfare programme.  The course, which is delivered in collaboration with the education unit in Castlerea Prison, is specially designed for delivery to students with literacy issues and is delivered visually with voice-over, assisted by the use of diagrams.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, this is an accredited programme which has been endorsed by the Racing Academy and Centre of Education, RACE, the organisation which trains jockeys.  The equine programme can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being, offer preparation for employment and, ultimately, make the community safer through a reduction in reoffending.  It can teach compassion through the care of a living animal, and we are confident that, through our association with the horse racing industry, which has raised more than &euro;120,000 towards this innovative programme, we can gain employment in the industry for prisoners who engage in the programme as stablehands and so on.<br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for the opportunity to participate and I am happy to answer any questions after my colleagues have spoken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk to the committee today about some of the important work we in the Probation Service do in the area of social inclusion and in addressing the critical challenges faced by the Traveller community engaged in our justice system today.<\/p> <p>  For those members who are less familiar with the work of the Probation Service, we are the lead organisation overseeing the assessment and management of offenders in the community.  We have approximately 400 staff based in more than 50 prison and community settings nationwide.  On any one day, the service is engaged with more than 9,000 people in the community and up to 2,000 prisoners in custody.  Of those being supervised in the community, some 1,500 are serving post-release supervision orders.  This equates to 50% of today's prison population.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to speak alongside my colleagues who have spoken today.  Effective and meaningful collaboration with these partners and others across the justice sector is critical to realising the Probation Service's vision of \"creating safer and more inclusive communities\" by enabling those referred to us to change their behaviour and make good on the harm they have caused.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, we published our new strategy statement, which outlines our key strategic targets for the next three years.  The promotion of inclusion is firmly placed at the centre of our vision and our work.  As a core pillar of our strategy, we are striving to become a more inclusive organisation by delivering fair and accessible services to all who come into contact with us.  We also see it as our duty to identify and seek to remove barriers that may prevent reintegration, rehabilitation and access to life opportunities, enabling each of us to participate fully and positively in society.  We incorporate working with the Traveller community as an integral element of this approach.<\/p> <p>  As a service, we have worked extensively with the Traveller community over many years, both through the work of probation officers and via our national network of 60 community organisations, to which we currently provide &euro;16 million in funding, representing approximately one third of our budget.  Many of these projects have a long history of providing services directly to Travellers and have been successful in tailoring their programmes and supports to this community.  I hope to have an opportunity to speak further about some of these projects at a later point today.<\/p> <p>  In analysing our data, we are acutely aware there are a highly disproportionate number of Travellers under probation supervision today.  As has been stated, while Travellers represent less than 1% of the total population of the State, they represent 11.3% of the Probation Service caseload.  The over-representation here is stark and mirrors similar findings elsewhere within the justice system.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, following a report published by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, and as my colleague, Mr. Black, has mentioned, we partnered with the St. Stephen's Green Trust to establish the Travellers in Prison Initiative, TPI.  This has been instrumental in helping us, as a national service, to address some of the key challenges and difficulties being experienced by Travellers under probation supervision. We have worked extensively with the TPI in the area of ethnic data collection to improve our data accuracy and consistency.  Our aim is to be able to use these data more effectively to monitor outcomes and be able to propose evidence-based responses that will enhance our approach in working with people from the Traveller ethnicity.  The TPI has been supporting our staff to approach ethnic identification in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner.  Our objective here is to ensure our service users feel at ease throughout this process and understand that data will remain confidential, only being used to enhance knowledge and improve services.<\/p> <p>  This year we also worked with the TPI to deliver a series of bespoke cultural awareness training sessions for probation officers and community service supervisors.  This training encouraged staff to reflect on and examine their own attitudes and behaviours and challenged them to consider subconscious biases.  The training placed a strong emphasis on user voice and proved highly insightful.  Another area of recent development has been our work in evaluating how we, as a service, can adapt our pre-sentence assessment reports, which we prepare for the criminal courts, to better account for the Traveller experience.<\/p><p>As part of our strategy, we intend to publish guidelines that can be utilised by probation staff to ensure a more culturally sensitive approach to the preparation of such reports.  In addition, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service continue to play a central role in supporting the Department of Justice's Working to Change: Social Enterprise and Employment Strategy 2021-23, which launched last November.  The strategy sets out a collaborative approach for supporting employment options for people with convictions.  It aims to remove the systemic barriers faced so people can make sustainable changes.  It builds on the solid foundation of employment supports already in place.<\/p><p> I am pleased the TPI actively participated in the development of the strategy.  Members of the Traveller community were identified as a key stakeholder group within the strategy and it is recognised that ongoing consultation, engagement and co-design is required if sustainable outcomes are to be achieved.  As chair of the social enterprise steering group, I am pleased to note the very positive progress being achieved across many of the 46 actions in the strategy.<\/p><p> I am satisfied the Probation Service has made positive progress in recent years in working more effectively with the Traveller community.  I recognise more work must be done and we must continue with that.  In keeping with our strategic pillar of inclusion, additional upcoming priorities include the following items.  Next month we will launch a new research report which examines the misuse of drugs and alcohol among people on probation supervision in Ireland.  The research, developed by Dr. Louise Rooney, acknowledges an over-representation of Travellers within the Probation Service caseload and includes culturally relevant findings.  Such findings will inform our work into the future.  We remain committed to enhancing gender-informed practices by working with our partners across the justice sector.  In this context, we will work on targeted responses and programmes that aim to enhance support for female Travellers in custody and in their return to the community.  We also remain committed to ensuring the Traveller voice and user experience is central to the development and delivery of our services and training.  In hearing those voices, we recognise the importance of listening.  We will aim to provide a response that is informed and sensitive to the cultural context, norms and values that are intrinsic to the lives of the Traveller community.  Finally, we look forward to expanding our collaboration with our partners, the TPI, the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, IASIO, the St. Stephen's Green Trust, the Irish Prison Service, and other colleagues to ensure the voice of the Traveller community is represented, heard and understood within the criminal justice system.<\/p><p> I thank members once again for the opportunity to speak to them today.  I look forward to taking questions later in the session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>It is a great pleasure to be here today to talk on behalf of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board about our service.  According to the 2016 census, 57.2% of male Travellers had only primary school education, a figure four times higher than the general population.  Only 13% of Traveller girls completed second level education whereas for the settled community the figure is 69%.  Some 1% of Travellers progressed to third level education and they made up just 0.1% of the total student body.  These are just some of the stark statistics which tell a story of generational, institutionalised disadvantage, the result of years of failed policies and neglect.  In this short submission, I would like to highlight just one important cause of this lamentable situation, namely, the issue of cultural identity and how it acts as a major barrier to the progress of our Traveller learners.<\/p> <p>  In 2010, a report by Maria Campbell and Niamh Hourigan identified the depth of prejudice Travellers encounter daily as a major contributory factor to members of the Travelling community not realising their potential as learners.  They further contended that \"mainstream educational and workplace contexts are dominated by the values, behaviours and authority structures of the settled community\".  In other words, for Travellers, school is a construct of the settled community, owing little to their lived experiences and their cultural norms.  Moreover, the lack of job opportunities for Travellers removes a compelling motive for pursuing an educational pathway.  As the report goes on to observe, Travellers feel an enormous stigma attached to their cultural identity, and 20% of the Travellers spoken to as part of the study who had participated in the workforce or further education had hidden their Traveller identity from co-workers or fellow students.<\/p> <p>  In response to this, the CDETB educational service to prisons has put in place a number of simple measures which are designed to promote a more culturally responsive environment within our prison education centres.  To underpin this work, we have asked a teacher within each centre to become a Traveller champion, to liaise with and advise head teachers on Traveller issues, to identify individual needs, and actively to encourage Travellers to attend classes.  We have also asked a teacher to lead and co-ordinate our efforts across the service.<\/p> <p>  If we are to make a real impact in improved educational outcomes for Travellers in our prisons, we must start with ourselves as providers.  As has been pointed out to us by the representatives of the Travelling community and by academic research on many occasions, those who deliver our services themselves need to engage in training and education so they can recognise those cultural barriers which impact on the educational progression of Traveller learners.  We must listen to our learners and learn from those who have experienced the reality of discrimination and inequality at first hand, and we must question our own values and beliefs.<\/p> <p>  In this respect, in June 2019, with the support of the Travellers in Prison Initiative, three CDETB teachers undertook a two-day introduction to equality and anti-discrimination issues delivered by Maynooth University.  The course concentrated on themes such as prejudice, discrimination, stereotyping, values and ideologies of superiority and their role in creating and replicating inequality.  The course also looked at the legislative frameworks and key organisations relating to equality in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Finally, our staff explored the possibilities of addressing inequality as teachers in the prison system.  We have also been instrumental in inviting various Traveller organisations into our education centres, and we have learned much about what we need to do to further educational progress for our Traveller learners.  Through our work with the Travellers in Prison Initiative, we have been active in promoting Traveller culture within our centres.  Traveller Pride weeks have included music performances by the legendary Finbar Furey, exhibitions of the traditional art of tin smithing, and local exhibitions and displays of art, photography and craft work celebrating Traveller culture.  The purpose of these events is to demonstrate that Traveller culture is valued within our centres.  In this respect, we have observed not only an increased level of pride expressed by Traveller learners but an increased interest in Traveller culture among those learners from a settled background.<\/p> <p>  Within our curriculum, we are endeavouring to ensure the needs of Travellers are recognised and catered for.  In Wheatfield Prison, for instance, we deliver the Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level three module on challenging discrimination to facilitate understanding of bias, prejudice and discrimination towards various sections of society, including the Travelling community.  In addition, we use materials that reflect Traveller culture in classes.  In Cloverhill Prison, for example, these range from books for literacy students by Ann Marie Collins to recordings for use in the music class by artists such as Johnny Doran.  During 2020 and 2021, our drama teacher in Arbour Hill and a group of students, including Travellers, devised a play based on Traveller culture and included use of the Cant-Gammon language in the script.<\/p><p>Literacy work is a key part of our educational service to prisons, and a range of approaches is employed for our adult learners, including one-to-one teaching, group work, Toe by Toe, Storybook Mums and Dads and the use of an interactive literacy package developed by our own teachers, which combines literacy and numeracy work with the development of digital skills.  Again, adult literacy work is integrated in all parts of the curriculum.<\/p><p> In this short presentation, it has been my intention to identify issues relating to cultural identity that act as a barrier to the educational progress of our Traveller learners.  It has not been to give the impression our delivery is perfect or that this work will, in itself, create educational equality for Travellers.  It is, however, a clear statement that without considerable efforts to recognise the value of Traveller identity in our schools, colleges and centres, reaching the goal of educational equality for all our Traveller citizens will be very difficult indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentations, which give an insight into what is happening.  I am curious about the training of staff in the Irish Prison Service, which was mentioned earlier.  Do they get special training to deal with ethnic minorities such as Travellers?  Is there a special training course or do staff undergo some sort of a process like that?<\/p> <p>  There were some notable comments about mental health treatment waiting lists, which are very long.  We have many prisoners coming in for a short period, such as a few months, and the chances of them having their mental health needs attended to are small.  Maybe some of them experience psychosis.  Are we able to address any of those cases in an emergency scenario?  The waiting lists are so long I am just not sure how we could deal with such cases.<\/p> <p>  I was very interested to hear about the equine centre in Castlerea.  I am involved with the horse projects in Finglas and Ballymun.  I assume that is open to all prisoners and Travellers specifically.  Is this for people who have been in Castlerea or are people being brought in from across the Irish Prison Service to avail of this and do training etc.?  Castlerea is an open prison so is this open to anybody else over the rest of the prison service?<\/p> <p>  Education is a major problem in the Traveller community and trying to get them on board and engaging is a great difficulty.  I wonder how we can encourage some Travellers to engage with the services as there may be a reluctance to do it in certain circumstances.  We spoke specifically about women earlier in the likes of the D&oacute;chas centre or such places.  It is harder to get them to engage in services than others.  Will the witnesses give us some insight into that?<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses give us an idea how addiction treatment services in the system work?  If somebody has a serious addiction problem, whether alcohol or drugs, how would he or she be treated or dealt with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#O00300","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I will deal with these questions initially before handing over to Mr. Beirne.  We train our recruited prison officers with specific pieces on anti-discrimination and the needs of minorities.  We have introduced the ethnic identifier, which Ms Costello mentioned earlier.  We did a collaborative training programme for staff involved in a census trying to identify properly the number of Travellers within the prison system.  Our colleagues in Pavee Point assisted us in that respect.  Mr. Beirne might give a broader indication of the training around diversity and anti-discrimination.<\/p> <p>  Mental health issues are probably the single biggest challenge we have had over the past five years or the past decade.  The issue is well rehearsed at this stage.  There is a disproportionate number of people coming into custody suffering from severe and enduring mental illness.  It is a challenge for us and our staff to manage that problem.  We have the services of the National Forensic Mental Health Service based within the Central Mental Hospital and it visits almost all our closed prisons.  Taking somewhere like Cloverhill, our main remand setting, we have a full team from the National Forensic Mental Health Service there but there is a major demand on services.  Some of these people should not be in custody but in a therapeutic environment instead, receiving appropriate care.  It is for that reason the four Ministers set up the task force.  I am hopeful that task force will identify appropriate therapeutic locations for people in that position, particularly where they have committed minor offences but have a major mental illness.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about short sentences.  Waiting lists are not based on when a prisoner has come in but rather clinical need.  A prisoner could have come in yesterday, but if the clinical need is there, such as if the prisoner is floridly psychotic, that prisoner will be dealt with as a priority by both our healthcare team and the national forensic team.  As the Deputy knows well, there is a major problem with securing admission to the Central Mental Hospital.  I hope the new facility will provide some degree of comfort, but I believe it could be more of a honeymoon than a solution.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the equine centre, and the idea came from Mr. Jonathan Irwin, who was involved with the racing industry and the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation.  We approached a former Minister about the success of such a programme in other jurisdictions, such as Maryland in the United States and in Australia.  Ultimately, we challenged the horse racing community, saying that if it fundraised to support the operation of the programme, we would build the facility.  As I mentioned, it has fundraised &euro;120,000 and it is now developing a five-year plan because it wants to sustain funding and continue the collaboration.  It is open to all prisoners in all prisons.<\/p> <p>  To clarify, Castlerea is a closed prison so the prisoners come from the prison every day.  They are selected based on behaviour etc.  There is a group of prisoners from the prison who care for the horses and do modules on care of horses in the education unit.  We have had Mr. Aidan O'Brien, Mr. Robert Hall and other horse racing personalities down there.  In fairness, if they follow through, people from the horse racing industry can be very supportive.  They have indicated that suitable people coming through the programme would be offered employment in the horse racing industry.  If I am to be honest, they would probably start as stable hands but we see it as an opportunity.  Currently, most stable hands come in from places like Brazil, so if there is an opportunity, it would be great.  I am hopeful the Minister on her return to office will officially open the facility and we will have a five-year plan working with the horse racing industry into the future.<\/p> <p>  Addiction is still a major challenge in prisons.  We have our own healthcare services, including GPs, and we have managed to recruit seven permanent GPs this year.  We have GPs with a special interest in problems arising from substance misuse.  We have a contract with Merchants Quay Ireland, which provides addiction counselling.  Could we do more?  Absolutely.  The task force is considering the question of addiction to see how we might develop further.  We have some work done but we have more to do.  Mr. Beirne might quickly speak to the training of staff and anti-discrimination measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  To underline Mr. Black's comments, there is a module in the training of recruited prison officers and they do a higher certificate in custodial care.<\/p><p>It includes a module on human rights and equality.  As staff move along in their careers, there is continuous professional development, under which some courses on equality, diversity, inclusion, human rights and dignity in the workplace are delivered.  When staff get promoted to, for example, assistant chief officer, there is a module on equality and dignity training.  Training on public sector duty is also provided to governors and directors.  As members are probably aware, that has to do with our duty under legislation to eliminate discrimination, provide equality of opportunity and protect the human rights of all our stakeholders.  That is the formal part.<\/p><p> In my role as equality, diversity and inclusion lead, I occasionally run awareness-raising sessions in prisons.  That is the roadshow that was referenced earlier.  We kicked it off recently and are looking in particular at saying \"No\" to sexual harassment and sexual assault within our prison walls.  This is all cross-sectional, in that it refers to Travellers as well as the settled community.  As part of that roadshow, we also touch on issues of anti-racism and raise awareness of the LGBTQI community and people with disabilities.  We often think of people with disabilities as those with physical disabilities, but I believe it was Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide who pointed out how there were also people with less visible disabilities, for example, psychological disabilities, autism or whatever.  We need to have an awareness of what we can provide for those prisoners to make their stay more comfortable, as it were.<\/p><p> There can be racism towards the Traveller community from fellow prisoners.  Last April, we delivered a piece on racism on a television channel that we have for prisoners.  Members will have seen the national media campaigns on raising awareness of racism and domestic violence.  We run those on our internal television channel.  We followed up with poster campaigns and the like to highlight these issues and make them more visible.<\/p><p> That is mainly what we do on the education side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Beirne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>Do Mr. Wilson or Ms Boyle wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#P00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>I will add something about the task force on mental health, which my colleague, Mr. Black, mentioned.

Our single most powerful way of doing so is by ensuring that, in our education centres and classrooms, they feel safe and free from the kind of racist abuse and innuendo that can occur in other education centres.  It was noted as far back as 2010 in Dr. Niamh Hourigan's report that the first time many Travellers experienced racist abuse was when they went into mainstream educational courses.  In many ways, it was masked when they were all being educated together.  That is a sad reflection on our society in general.  A priority for us is ensuring that our centres and classrooms are free from that type of name calling, references to people's mode of speech and that kind of nasty stuff, which can undermine a person.  It is not surprising that, at a human level, people are reluctant to engage in our mainstream education services.  There is just too much of that stuff happening.<\/p> <p>  We ensure that the curriculum is relevant to the Traveller community, including the community's needs in living in a society that is integrated in an inclusive sense.  I sometimes have reservations about the term \"integrated\".  It should be \"inclusive\", in other words, where both the settled culture and the Traveller culture are recognised and settled people feel a willingness to participate in courses that have relevance to Traveller culture.  We find that this is one of the positive aspects of many of the events that we organise around Traveller culture.  The settled community in the prison were also present at the events and were curious about some aspects of Traveller culture.  This is another way that we try to bridge the gap between the settled and Traveller cultures, with each getting its fair share of respect.<\/p> <p>  Ms Edwards might like to speak about something else that we do, that is, proactively going after students within the prison.  We send people into prisons to tell them about courses.  It would be best if Ms Edwards spoke about this, as she has an interesting story about her work as our outreach worker and co-ordinator of our TPI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>I will give a brief outline of what we do.  I am the Traveller liaison teacher for the Mountjoy campus, including the main Mountjoy jail, the progression unit and the D&oacute;chas women's prison.  I took over this role in September 2020 and I have three half-day slots to meet Travellers in each unit.  Working with the TPI has been positive for us in the CDETB and we have benefited from the diversity and inclusion training that the initiative provides.  It has helped us to reflect on our own practices, attitudes and unconscious bias and to evaluate the services that we provide for Travellers.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that school completion rates are lower among the Traveller community than in the general population, both in the community and in prison.  To try to address this, and with the support of Travellers who work with the TPI, we developed resources that are more Traveller centred.  However, many Travellers opt for classes in arts and crafts.  Thus, literacy can remain an issue for them.<\/p><p>The IPS recently granted us permission to open up the recreational areas of the protection landings to offer additional literacy and numeracy support to prisoners, including many Travellers who have reduced access to education due to their protection status.  In my role, I meet with Traveller men and women on the landings and in the education centres.  This has proved an extremely helpful way for us to identity Travellers who are not engaging with education.  While the role was initially aimed at encouraging Travellers to come to the education centre, it has evolved into an extended role of linking Travellers with the relevant services on and off the campus, including addiction counselling, IASIO, chaplaincy, Exchange House Ireland, the TPI and the National Traveller Women's Forum.  All of the referrals to the various services are recorded.  This gives a clear picture of the key needs of Travellers in prison.  Requests and referrals largely relate to accommodation issues, mental health and anxiety, family suicide, literacy, family issues, loneliness, having nothing to do while in prison and pre- and post-release advice and support.  For the CDETB, key areas for development include continued focus on literacy and educational engagement and exploring links with our further education and training sector to provide post-release supports for Travellers and positive pathways to life in the community.<\/p><p> To return to Deputy Ellis's question, we tend to find that the best way to engage is to go down the landings.  This helps us to meet with people.  After that, it is word of mouth.  While it is great that people now identify and use the ethnicity identifier, there is one area where this could be tweaked because as it stands it does not enable us to do a search for the number of Travellers in prison.  We first have to find the name of the prisoner before we can search to see if that person has identified as a Traveller or not.  If the system were tweaked slightly, we would be able to draw up the names.  This would help us to find a broader range of people who would, hopefully, engage with our services.  When Travellers find their way up to the education centre and they have even one positive engagement they will come back and they will bring other people with them.  That is the best way we can target them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Ms June Edwards","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Edwards.

I am impressed by the work being done by the organisations in terms of the different measures they are trying to implement in response to issues affecting the Traveller community.  Ms Edwards made the point that within general society there is either racism, in its most cynical and hard sense, or an unconscious bias against the Traveller community and ethnic groups.  This must seep into the prison and probation services.  They are not unique and cannot be separated from it.  Mr. Beirne made the point that for prisoner officers this issue is addressed by way of education.  I am not sure if the Probation Service has a similar policy with regard to probation officers.  I am interested in hearing how those courses are impacting on the attitudes of the officers within the prison and probation services in light of the reference earlier to the WhatsApp conversation among officers that was released and in which the language used was cruel and nasty in regard to the Traveller community.  The issue is how we over come that.  I believe the only way we can overcome it is through greater linkage of people from the Traveller community with non-Traveller people.  This might help the latter to understand that Travellers are human and there is no difference between them other than that the Traveller community has been separated for so long from society it has become a group that people are suspicious of when they should be welcoming them.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Wilson, Mr. Black and Mr. Beirne.  What more can be done to try to cut across that unconscious bias and racism within the prison and probation services?  My next question is in respect of an issue raised by Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, namely, the complaint mechanism within the Prison Service.  It was stated that a complaints mechanism was supposed to be introduced by the end of 2019, which later became 2020 and has been changed again to 2021.  I note that Prison Service is in negotiations with the Department of Justice on that matter.  Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide appears to be hopeful that it will be introduced by the end of 2021.  Perhaps she would clarify the situation for us.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that many of the sentences are for pretty crime.  In general, sentences for such crime should be non-custodial.  For many in the settled community, it would be a non-custodial sentence, but among the Traveller community a higher percentage of people are being committed to prison for pretty crime.  Another issue raised was that of additional women's open prisons to try to support women in the Prison Service.  I ask Mr. Black to comment on whether that would be a positive action.<\/p> <p>  My final question is to the CDETB.  It is doing fantastic work in linking the cultural, settled Traveller community and in trying to develop the cultural aspect of the Traveller community and make Travellers feel proud of their culture and ethnicity.  What more could be done in this regard?  Are there examples of measures in place in other countries that the Irish State could implement to expand on the actions of the CDETB?  As I said, the CDETB is doing really good work, buy how many people does it impact within the Traveller community?  Do only a small percentage respond to it or does the CDETB have a broad access to people in the Traveller community in terms of the work that it does?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#Q00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>There are only 22 minutes remaining, and I have yet to ask my questions.

In respect of the question on open prisons, the review of penal policy in 2014 recommended an open prison for women.  Working jointly with the Probation Service, the Prison Service proposed the development of a step-down unit for women as an alternative.  The Outlook facility in Dublin is run by Focus Ireland for that purpose.  It complements the T&uacute;s Nua service and the Abigail Women's Centre run by Depaul in Finglas, which equally targets referrals from the prison and probation services.<\/p> <p>  On sentences and petty crime, the Probation Service is currently managing approximately 800 members of Traveller community.  One third of them are with us for assessment, one third are on community service and one third are under some form of probation order.  The top five offences for which they are referred to us are theft, assault offences, public order, road traffic offences and burglary.  The figure for theft sentences is higher than the non-Traveller percentile.  Outside of that, the other areas are lower than the non-Traveller percentiles.  Those are the key offences in respect of which we are working with members of the Traveller community.<\/p> <p>  On cultural sensitivity or bias in the context of Probation Service staff, as I mentioned in my opening address, TPI has brought in a user voice to assist with that cultural training for our staff.  I will ask my colleague, Ms Doyle, to say a little more in respect of probation officer training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Wilson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  As mentioned in the opening address, there are three key areas for us in relation to that training for our staff in service.<\/p><p>I will take a step back.  In recent years, probation officer entry requirements have led to us having an upskill or uplift whereby all new probation officers coming into the system have to be qualified in social work and registered with CORU.  The relevance of that is that they would work from a professional base around social justice and the values pertaining to the social work profession.  They are strong in terms of the ethical requirement around that.  We would be naive to think that wipes out all unconscious or subconscious bias but it puts our staff interfacing with the clientele in a positive place to start off with.  Similarly, throughout their time in probation, staff have access to continuous professional development and, as we referred to earlier, we have been doing a lot of work around cultural awareness training.  We have been revisiting that in the last couple of years.<\/p><p> Another area we have been revisiting in the last year has been with the assistance with the Travellers in Prison Initiative, TPI.  We brought the ethnic identifier into our data collection systems.  While staff were given guidance on how to engage with their clientele around that, people felt uncomfortable and were not sure if they were being offensive or whether people were happy to be asked these questions.  Our training is around supporting our staff to understand the importance of asking the question.  If we do not ask the question we cannot get the data to inform service delivery.  It is also to help them to understand and develop skills in how best to ask those questions in an appropriate manner.  That is important for our staff.<\/p><p> We prepare pre-sentence reports for courts at all levels nationwide.  While we work at an assessment being about an individual and his or her offence at a given time so it is around the uniqueness and them taking responsibility for that, we also set it in a context.  That is one of the added values we bring to the court process.  That said, we are looking, as Mr. Wilson referred to, at updating our guidelines to ensure they are culturally sensitive and more informative for the court, particularly around issues for the Travelling community or ethnic minorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Una Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Measuring the impact of all this training can be difficult.  It has been said that it is about changing a culture.  There is a certain culture in Ireland and a prison is a microcosm of the country.  Changing a culture takes a while.  Is it working?  All we can do is look at the number of complaints made, notwithstanding what was said earlier, from prisoners and staff.  We take any allegations of racism or negative attitudes towards Travellers seriously.  Prisoners go through the P19 process, which is a punishment in the prison.  Staff cases would be investigated on a case-by-case basis and treated seriously.  It would depend on the level of seriousness and I cannot say what would happen.  We will monitor it.  Covid has put a stall on this, but we intended doing a survey of staff and prisoners on things related to equality, diversity and inclusion.  We intend to do that and to keep monitoring attitudes, which will hopefully show what the impact is.  It is a secondary measure, I suppose.  You can do all the training in the world, but if people do not accept it, what can you do?  We have to look at the outcomes.<\/p> <p>  What more can be done?  I suppose more can be done to raise awareness.  I spoke with our education colleagues previously.  I intend to do an awareness-raising of Traveller culture, based on what the Department of Education is doing on its side.  That is something positive going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Beirne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy Joan Collins's question, we have more work to do to prevent discrimination.  That is the honest answer.  I meant to say to Deputy Ellis that one of the reasons we chose Castlerea was that in our last ethnicity survey across all the prisons, Castlerea had 95 prisoners who identified as Travellers.  That was 31.5% of the population, which is an indictment of the over-representation of Travellers in our criminal justice system.<\/p> <p>  On complaints, it is not an area I am responsible for but substantial work has been completed on staff training and the integrated IT system.  There is a draft policy on complaints handling and there is engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to give legal effect to the new complaints system.  Will it happen this year?  I do not think it will happen this calendar year.  There is an issue with resourcing the new complaints system which is yet to be finalised.  <\/p> <p>  On the non-custodial options, we deal with people sent from the courts.  On the other end, in terms of the back-door arrangement, there are the community support and community return schemes we run jointly with our colleagues in probation.  I have statistics on Traveller participants.  Of the 599 people serving sentences of less than a year who were released on a structured release programme last year under the community support scheme, 55 were Travellers.

Many have difficulty regulating their emotions.  Typically they are young men who have fallen out of school, education, training and society.  One thing we must take away from here is that if we want fewer Travellers going to prison, we have to deal with their socioeconomic position.  That is why the committee deals with health, housing, education, discrimination, employment, etc.  If people do not get a fair chance in life, they have a much higher risk of winding up in prison.  That is obvious.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Black said something interesting.  He referred to mental health and, as I understand it, a fair number of people in prison who are Travellers have mental health issues.  Mr. Black made the comment that some should not be in custody.  That is interesting because I would always say prison is the last resort for anybody.  As a society, we should look at every other option and see if there are better options.  I wonder if in 100 years' time people will look at us and ask why we inherited a prison system and kept going with it.  Will Mr. Black elaborate on the point he made?  It is key.  Improving the prison system is key but we also have to look at whether there are people there who should not be there in the first place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#R00400","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I stand over my view that there are people in custody who have committed a minor infraction within the criminal justice system but whose behaviour is odd or erratic etc.  I am not blaming anybody but they end up in custody, especially in a remand setting and in Cloverhill Prison.  If you meet the consultant psychiatrist and our teams of healthcare people or officers in Cloverhill, they will tell you they come across people every day who are in for minor offences.  It has been outlined to me that somebody was picked up for shouting in public and ended up in Cloverhill Prison for some kind of public order offence or, in another case, for defecating in a taxi.  These are people with a real underlying condition.  They are young men, typically suffering from schizophrenia, many of whom are actively psychotic and, unfortunately, have been failed by mental health services in the community.  Many of them are homeless so they have all of those combinations of complexities and they end up in our custody.  Our staff do their best with them, but those people who have committed very minor infractions within the criminal justice system should be in a therapeutic environment.<\/p> <p>  The Central Mental Hospital service in Cloverhill set up the diversion programme.  Every year, Dr. Conor O'Neill and his team divert approximately 150 prisoners.  They go back to the judge in court, tell him or her that they have found the person a residential or community placement with a mental health service, the judge discharges the case and the person is then discharged to that mental health service.  It works very well.  We need to extend that to all centres where we take in remand prisoners, such as Cork, Limerick and Castlerea.  It is a very good service and it is something my colleague, Mark Wilson, spoke about that is being examined as part of the task force.

The partner knows that the children are being looked after by his or her wife or partner.  When a woman comes into custody, invariably there are difficulties where she has a whole complexity of issues in terms of mental health, addiction and psychological care.  Her children could face being taken into care.

I mentioned we are in contact with 9,000 people in the community.  Many of them have been in prison and, unless they make changes in their lives, many will end up in prison.  At the outset, we need to make sure that those who have health issues should not come into the justice system at all, where possible.  The approach of looking at diversion for minor drug offences or mental health issues is an appropriate way to do just that and to minimise those coming into the system at all.<\/p> <p>  The point in respect of mental health again reflects the similarity in the populations.  We published a mental health survey earlier this year, which identified 40% of our client group as having mental health difficulties.  It was 57% for women while the rate is 18% for the general population.  Of those 40% I am discussing, half of that group also presented with an alcohol or drug addiction, difficult family relationships and accommodation instability.

The idea of the horse project is a fantastic one and I applaud those in the industry who funded it.  My first question is a practical one.  Should this project be funded out of the horse and greyhound fund that goes into the horse and greyhound industry generally?  Should it be considered as part of this?  I was on an agriculture committee that looked at all the issues relating to the horse and greyhound fund.  Should State funding be directly available and ring-fenced for this purpose so it could be done in other appropriate prisons?  That is a straightforward question.<\/p> <p>  We know from independent surveys in society that Travellers are probably the group that is most discriminated against, and the most distant from society in general, if you look at all the ethnic identifiers across the board.  Those who are doing the training with staff, therefore, have a challenge because there is an inherent bias that is already very prevalent in society.  There is no point in us denying it; it is sociologically proven.  Is there a challenge in training in that people might see those of other nationalities and ethnic groups as being more identifiable than Travellers when talking about racism?  Is there a tendency not to see racism in quite the same terms when it comes to our own people in the Traveller community, just in relation to training?  There is nothing wrong with recognising difficulties and saying we face a challenge.  How much of a challenge is it that people might say they definitely know they should not discriminate against somebody of colour or whatever, but we know that in society that mentality does not often prevail when it comes to the Traveller community?  Is this factored into training?  Those are two different questions.  One is for the Prison Service and the other I will throw to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#S00900","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the horse welfare issue.  We have approached this as a collaboration, and I would say that we should continue to do so.  The horse racing industry has come to us.  Recent events have left the industry in the situation where it has not had good publicity and it sees the opportunity of working with us as something that can show it is giving back to society.  That is the approach it has taken to me.  More importantly, it potentially provides employment opportunities.<\/p> <p>  My most recent meeting with industry representatives was three weeks ago.  They want to appoint an ambassador from within their industry and they have some senior figures in mind who will be the ambassador for this programme.  We want to get to a situation where people coming to the end of their sentence, who complete the modules on this programme, can go and maybe start off as stable hands, etc., and get employment and act as role models.  We currently have an external agency, which is funded by the horse racing industry, providing the expert training and they have staff there.  We want prisoners who graduate through that to become the staff.  We wanted to show that it is working.<\/p> <p>  While we will accept money from anywhere, I am of the view that the money coming from the horse racing industry offers a number of opportunities.  It opens doors for us in terms of employment and linkages.  We have also put money into it as a State, however.  We built a facility that includes the American shed and the arena and we provided the equipment.  It is a real collaboration.  I believe that having the industry on board to create that opportunity for employment is really positive for us in terms of progression.  If we have progression, we will attract prisoners to continue to feed into it because each module only takes eight weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021102100002#T00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>Perhaps I will reframe the question.

With regard to what Ms Doyle said about racism training and so forth, training works with some people.  Certainly, our inputs to the probation staff worked very well.  We had people who were coming from that frame of mind who were open to it.  I think with other people and staff in other organisations where there are deeply embedded racist attitudes, the only response is zero tolerance.  The prison is a very hierarchical organisation.  It needs to come from the very top that there will be consequences for racist behaviour.  That is where we will see real change.<\/p> <p>  On a more positive note, again, some of our initiatives have worked really well.  That is something about which the attendees have all spoken today.  Many of them have worked so well because we have champions in the various organisation who are driving it forward.  That is really great but the danger is that we rely on individuals and when they move on, the work gets set back again.  Therefore, we need to mainstream it.  We need to embed the initiatives we started now.  And when we have shown that they work in different particular prisons, we need to roll it out across the other prisons and use the learning from that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we need to work more closely with the committee to scrutinise the data.  Travellers are very reluctant to identify as Travellers because, in the past, their identity has been used against them.  They are being encouraged now to come forward and identify as Travellers.  In Michael Donovan's time, he assured Travellers that there would be benefits for them and extra resources, workshops, etc., and for those reasons, they did identify.  We need to continue that.  We need to show the people who are asking the questions that there are benefits for them in identifying as Travellers because there will be changes in how services are delivered.

The package was published by the European Commission in July and will be the primary means by which member states working in co-ordination ensure that the EU achieves the ambition of its Green New Deal.  Together the legislative proposals that make up the Fit for 55 package aim to support the reduction in the EU&rsquo;s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and to set Europe on the path for climate neutrality by 2050.  The package is among the most wide-ranging and ambitious ever proposed by the European Commission and includes proposals on climate, energy, land use, taxation, and transport.  These proposals, which are now being examined in detail by the member states, in the Council working parties and by MEPs in the European Parliament, will have substantial implications for Ireland&rsquo;s transport policy and investment decisions for the foreseeable future.  They will impact on people&rsquo;s daily lives, leisure, travel, and commutes.  The package will frame infrastructure policy and the future development of our ports, airports and our national road network.  In that context the Department welcomes the opportunity to discuss several of the transport related proposals in detail with members today to reflect on the views of this committee and, of course, to return to discuss progress on this package as necessary.<\/p> <p>  The proposals we will discuss today are, in aviation, a revision of the EU emissions trading system, ETS, legislation for aviation along with a separate proposal to align the EU system with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, CORSIA, and the ReFuel Aviation proposal which aims to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuels.<\/p> <p>  In shipping, the fuel EU maritime proposal aims to increase the share of renewable and low carbon fuels in the fuel mix of international maritime transport.  In road transport, a revised C02 standards regulation will set higher C02 emission reductions targets for manufacturers producing cars and vans.  Finally, the cross-cutting alternative fuels infrastructure proposal seeks to ensure the availability of an infrastructure network that will support these low- and zero-emission vessels, vehicles and aircraft.<\/p> <p>  The first general observation to make is that nationally we are committed to delivering a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.<\/p><p>That commitment, as part of the programme for Government, is enshrined legally in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and forms part of our international commitment to the UN Paris Agreement.  The EU Fit for 55 package is the EU contribution to this effort.  The committee will already have received information notes from the Department on these proposals but I will briefly set out the key elements of each ahead of the discussion today, beginning with the aviation proposals. <br\/><br\/>The EU ETS is one of the most important and effective instruments in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector.  The revision of the ETS for aviation aims to ensure that the sector contributes to the EU&rsquo;s 2030 emissions reduction target.  The proposal will phase out free allowances currently granted to airlines and will integrate the global CORSIA system into the ETS.  To explain briefly what is meant by this, the free allowances allocated to airlines mean that they only begin to pay for their emissions once they exceed a certain threshold.  Allowances were originally afforded to EU airlines to maintain their competitiveness against non-EU airlines who were not participating in the ETS.  Under this proposal, these free allowances will be phased out by 2026.  The ETS will continue to apply to intra-EU flights and CORSIA will apply as appropriate to extra-EU flights.  The manner by which CORSIA is integrated into a more ambitious ETS will be an important signal internationally of the EU&lsquo;s commitment to a global approach.  <br\/><br\/>The next proposal, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative will oblige fuel suppliers to blend increasing levels of sustainable aviation fuels in kerosene taken onboard at EU airports, including, when the technology is ready, synthetic low carbon fuels, known as e-fuels.  EU airports, which process more than 1 million passengers or 100,000 tonnes of cargo a year, will be obliged to provide sustainable aviation fuels, SAF, while airlines will also be mandated to uplift 90% of their fuel requirement from EU airports to avoid tankering at airports that do not supply sustainable aviation fuels.  Measures to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuels are an effective means to tackle the aviation emissions challenge comprehensively in the medium and long term.  Such measures, coupled with new aircraft technology, can provide decarbonisation in the sector without suppressing or offsetting journeys.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the maritime sector, the FuelEU Maritime proposal aims to stimulate the uptake of sustainable maritime fuels and zero-emission technologies in ships calling at European ports.  This is to be achieved by setting a limit on the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board.  This will begin with a 2% reduction in 2025 rising in five-year intervals to a 75% reduction in the limit allowed by 2050.  The proposed regulation also requires passenger and container ships to connect to an onshore power supply or use zero emission technology while in the port of a member state.  The proposed alternative fuels infrastructure regulation sets the corresponding mandatory date of 2030 for ports to have the necessary onshore power supply infrastructure <i>in situ<\/i>.  These requirements will apply to vessels over 5,000 gross tonnes and will cover all intra-EU journeys as well as half of any journey between a third country and an EU port.  Even though the ships covered by the regulation represent only 55% of all ships calling to EEA ports, they are responsible for 90% of the CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions from the maritime sector.  The proposed regulation will apply to less than 20 internationally trading vessels currently on the Irish flag but will impact many more vessels that use Irish ports.  <br\/><br\/>Moving to road transport, the Fit for 55 package also includes a proposal to revise the existing EU regulation on CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions standards for cars and light goods vehicles to reflect the EU&rsquo;s increased climate ambition.  The existing regulation sets EU fleet-wide CO<sub>2<\/sub>emission reduction targets for manufacturers, which apply from 2020, 2025 and from 2030, and includes a counting mechanism to incentivise the production of zero- and low-emission vehicles.  While no changes are proposed to the 2025 targets, the new proposal significantly strengthens the targets as of 2030.  Under the proposal average emissions of new cars would be reduced by 55% from 2030 and 100% from 2035 compared to 2021 levels.  This would effectively mean that only zero-emissions vehicles could be placed on the market from 2035, five years after Ireland&rsquo;s targeted phase-out date.  The proposal would also remove the incentivised counting mechanism for zero- and low-emission vehicles from 2030 as it is expected that by this stage the market uptake for these vehicles will be driven by the stricter 2030 and 2035 CO<sub>2<\/sub>targets. These stricter targets are expected to accelerate the supply of zero- and low-emission vehicles on the market while stimulating innovation from manufacturers.  As emissions from cars and vans in Ireland comprise 51% and 7%, respectively, of our land transport emissions, measures requiring manufacturers to produce cleaner vehicles can have a significant impact here.  <br\/><br\/>I will turn to the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a revised alternative fuels infrastructure regulation.  This regulation seeks to ensure the availability and usability of a widespread infrastructure network throughout the EU to facilitate a quicker transition to cleaner vehicles, ships and aircraft.  The proposed regulation will require member states to expand recharging capacity in line with zero-emission electric vehicle sales, and to install charging and fuelling points at regular intervals on major highways, every 60 km for electric charging and every 150 km for hydrogen refuelling.  It also includes targets for shore-side electricity provisions, a mandate that all fixed and remote contact stands at airports supply electricity to aircraft on standby by 2025 and 2030, respectively, and proposals on the use of LNG as a transport fuel. <br\/><br\/>To conclude, through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, Ireland has committed to a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  At approximately 20% of the national emissions, it is clear the transport sector has a significant role to play in achieving this objective.  The quantum and pace of the transformation needed over the next decade is significant.  It will require a fundamental change in the nature of Irish transport.  The transport proposals under the Fit for 55 package are broadly aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s ambition and will support the achievement of our targets.  The proposals are currently under consideration by all member states at EU level and Ireland will continue to participate fully in these discussions. <br\/><br\/>I hope this summary has been useful to members and I look forward to their questions.  Ms Patricia Waller will take any questions on COM (2021) 556 in regard to CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions from cars and vans.  Ms Niamh O'Brien my aviation colleague, will take COM (2021) 552, COM (2021) 561 and COM (2021) 567, the three aviation proposals.  Our colleague on the maritime side unfortunately could not attend today and sends her apologies so I will take COM (2021) 562.  My colleague, Mr. Caoimhin O'Ciaruain, will take COM (2021) 559 on the alternative fuels infrastructure regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021102100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Burke.

I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which met on this and came to the conclusion that there was a need for a reasoned opinion on behalf of the committee and I am of the same opinion in regard to this.  It is a significant package and it has major implications for policy here.  I would question about subsidiary and the control that we have in Ireland versus the control at European level.  What is the status the package and the timeline for it?  At what stage are the ongoing negotiations in the process towards the adoption of the package, if that is where we are going with it?  I also have questions on the opportunity, as the Department sees it, to become a leader in the hydrogen space.  Other countries have a hydrogen strategy.  We have a suite of measures in these proposals to be used as levers to nudge sectors in a certain direction.  A key part of that is the development of alternative fuels.  Who wants to take a question on the opportunity to advance research and innovation and be a leader in the development of those alternative fuels?  That is particularly relevant for aviation.  As Mr. Burke identified in his opening statement, there is an opportunity for Ireland to be leader in that space and to play a big role.<\/p><p>For those working in the fishing sector, and I know there is an element of the scale of the fishing operation that people run, is this not just another punitive measure that is being introduced in an industry that is already under serious pressure, in an Irish context, at least?

Will additional levies, burdens and costs just be heaped on it?<\/p><p> There seems to be a concerning contradiction around the piece on LNG.  We have outlined our policy position in Ireland on LNG.

How do we square the direction of travel at a European level with that here in Ireland?<\/p><p>  On the issue of electric vehicles, EVs, a change was made to the EV support scheme in recent days.  It maps out further changes in that regard up to 2030.  Are the witnesses aware of the reasoning behind the decision to introduce those changes at such short notice, and the degree to which the impact on people who had committed to purchasing EVs was taken into account?  I have heard directly from taxi drivers who are going to be out of pocket because the vehicles will not arrive before the end of the year and they do not cost over &euro;60,000.  Where did the &euro;60,000 threshold figure come from?

I thank the Deputy for his comments.  On the timing of the package, the main focus and intensity at EU level currently is around the alternative fuel infrastructure regulation, AFIR, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative proposals.  They are the two main areas of focus.  We expect a possible meeting of the transport Council in early December, at which we will seek policy agreement on both of those proposals.  We expect to see a discussion paper on the FuelEU Maritime Initiative proposal, because it is moving slowly.  The other areas are moving at a slower pace again.  The main focus will be on the alternative fuel  infrastructure regulation and ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative, with the FuelEU Maritime Initiative proposal coming immediately after that.  That is the current priority.<\/p> <p>  In terms of fuels, what the EU is trying to do is to stimulate the market to develop these fuels in the same way that we are developing technology for vehicles.  Looking at the maritime sector, the legislative proposals are silent on the type of fuel to be used.  They are neutral on the fuel types.  That is because there is no predominant alternative fuel.  In the maritime sector, there needs to be a complete switch from almost 99% use of fossil fuels currently to 90% use of renewable or low-carbon fuels by 2050.  However, currently, the market has not determined which of those fuels will be the primary one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021102100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>In respect of the aviation sector, the proposals mention the use of blended fuel up to 2050, more or less.

There are questions around the sustainability of such fuels, which will be taken into account.  Focus will be on the carbon-intensity of the fuels.  In the maritime sector, the EU will seek to create that demand for alternative fuels.  The proposals are neutral on which fuels will be used.  In aviation, the proposal is to use blended fuel and the sustainable aviation fuels that are available.  Perhaps Ms O'Brien might speak to that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of EVs, there is a plan to roll out electric vehicles.  The infrastructure that has been determined through AFIR and our own national plans will be slightly ahead of the pace in terms of the demand by users.<\/p> <p>  The roll-out of lower carbon-intensity and alternative fuels will be gradual.

Are our targets more or less ambitious?  <\/p> <p>  As well as that, we all want to try to reduce our carbon emissions in every different way, whether it is by using more efficient ways of transport, insulating our homes, putting up solar panels or getting new windows and we are all trying to cut down on our energy consumption, not just from a climate change perspective but also from a cost perspective.  Fuel is increasingly expensive and carbon taxes are there to incentivise us to use less of them.  <\/p> <p>  What are the penalties if we do not manage to get to these targets, that is, if these rules are implemented and people do not manage to achieve them, for whatever reason?

I do not want to be negative about it but equally, I want to know the consequences, as this is all quite theoretical at the moment and is very much aspirational.

Can the witnesses tell us what airports are not affected by this?  Are Kerry and Donegal airports affected by it or is it just Dublin Airport or is it Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports or whatever?  Equally, we had the chairman designate of Dublin Airport Authority before the committee yesterday, in a three-hour meeting.  We were not discussing this and had many other things to discuss but perhaps if we had had our meetings in a different order we would have been asking him what is Dublin Airport doing in sustainable aviation, fuel, more electric infrastructure in order not having to use aviation fuel when aeroplanes are on the ground and so on in terms of recharging of various components on the aeroplanes.<\/p> <p>  On maritime issues, what of our ports?  What ports are affected?  I get the impression that this relates to the much larger ships, many of which do not have the Irish flag - a small number do - that are using Irish ports, as do some Irish-flagged ships.

Have we spoken to the motor industry as to where it is and how achievable they see these targets or how it affects them?

I will deviate slightly.  There has been a lot of talk about sustainable energy, renewables and so on.  Recently, a relative of mine purchased an electric car.  I believe the carbon footprint of manufacturing that car would not be any different from that of manufacturing a fossil fuel petrol or diesel car.  We must start looking at the next issue, which is the electric aspect of it.  The car does approximately 30 km before the battery needs a recharge and then it switches over to petrol.  I understand the vehicle is more expensive to run on petrol once the electric side is gone.  That is a matter of concern to me.<\/p> <p>  Underpinning the electric side of the vehicle is the fact that it has batteries.  There is no doubt that the batteries are made using materials that have been mined, in some places by children.  I am not so sure that health and safety is foremost on the minds of those involved in mining for cobalt.  When we in this wealthy part of the world talk about saving the planet, what are the human costs of what we are doing for poorer parts of the world?  Are we once again going to places like Africa, which were raped of their resources for years, in order to feed the machine in the western world?  Are we at this again?  Is that what we are doing?

I cannot answer that for him.  All I can say about the crops and so on is that there is now a much greater awareness, which I mentioned earlier, of the life cycle of biofuels and a move away from the type of practice the Senator talks about whereby we affect groups of people in other parts of the world in order that we can fuel cars on this side of the world.

The policies need to change in that they need to have a massive human rights aspect to them.  When it comes to mining for cobalt, for example, unless the mining is done under exactly the same conditions as it would be done under European conditions and unless health and safety is met all the way through, we should not manufacture electric cars to travel 30 km in order to see children's lives destroyed.  Similarly, I just cannot subscribe to growing crops to provide fuel when many millions of people in this world are starving or living in poverty.

As I mentioned, this issue has been raised with the European Commission.

He singled out, I think, that Waterford and Rosslare ports have a slightly different designation to the other three ports - Cork, Dublin and Foynes.  He has also said more or less the same about the aviation sector, that the large airports carrying over a million people are being targeted and that they would be covered by these directives.  As for competition policy, what will happen when people who are under the strictures of those guises - the large airports, let us say - look at the likes of Waterford Airport, which we want to see as a regional airport in the south east?  Will they cry foul and say they face additional competitive restrictions because they are signed up to these initiatives whereas it looks like Waterford does not have to pay these levies or provide this infrastructure?  That is the first question to which I would like an answer.<\/p> <p>  Second, Mr. Burke has spoken about the synthetic fuels, blended fuels and so on.  It is like Groundhog Day to me.  A number of years ago I was involved with a consortium that was trying to bring a plastics-to-fuel process into Ireland.  We did a lot of work.  We went and got changes to the European directive.  We got it included on plastics-to-fuel.  We could get no investment from the Government to support the economic development or employee take-up in this country, unfortunately, and that business was subsequently bought out and taken out of Ireland.  What engagement does the Department have with key commercial players in all these sectors on energy generation, alternative fuel manufacturing and biogas generation?  Is the Department speaking to people?  Has it put people into its sights to talk to?  Will it engage with commercial industry here to make sure we have something that is synergistic with the present commercial realities?  We want to do this work and want to bring people in, but does the Department have a database, and what engagement does it have with industry players at present?<\/p> <p>  Third, I heard Deputy Matthews say we cannot have liquid natural gas, LNG, and that we must convert to wind.  We have not got even as far as designating a wind port yet in our roll-out of offshore wind, so offshore wind is about ten years away.  We will need LNG to continue.  Also, we have no biomass plant in this country outside of one that has been privately supported financially, that is, not supported by the State.  These are used for municipal heating systems throughout Europe.  Has the Department any plans in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I think I have covered most of the main areas I wish to cover.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on those three issues, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021102100002#K00700","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634770800,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>To be clear, when we talked about the different designations for the ports and airports, that is from TEN-T policy.  It is not linked to these policies; it is just that those tend to be the biggest ports and airports and, for the purpose of these regulations, they have been tapped into.<\/p> <p>  As for the issue of competitiveness, the proposal is built on the fact that we take the heavy lifters, we use those and we roll out the policy through the people who have the capacity to do it.  Taking the maritime one I mentioned, by targeting ships above 5,000 tonnes, 90% of the emissions are targeted.  It would be similar, I would guess, on the aviation side.  You are therefore targeting the larger ships and not hitting the smaller ports and building the heavy lifting at the larger end of the scale, which is a reasonable way to do it.<\/p> <p>  Again, the issue of fuels and alternative fuels is not a policy matter for this Department primarily.  From the point of view of transport, we in Ireland tend to be fuel takers, that is, most of the fuel we get is imported and, as Ms O'Brien mentioned, for the likes of aviation and maritime, it will be blended at that stage, so the blending does not tend to happen here.  It is a matter of finding those existing fuel suppliers in Europe or wherever else and using the blend of fuels they have.<\/p><p>Obviously, I cannot speak to the specific example the Deputy gave from his own experience but that is not to say there are not opportunities there as the market develops for businesses to grow in Ireland.<\/p><p> On the issue of offshore wind, all I can say from a transport point of view is there is a lot of work going on.  I do not know if the Deputy was there when I made the point earlier that there is a call out at the moment under the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, which is funding, and will fund, the likes of alternative fuels infrastructure.  It will fund facilities in ports for offshore wind.  There have been a lot of expressions of interest, or a few, in relation to ports and the facilities that can be built out to facilitate the future development of offshore wind.  One of the key things offshore wind needs is the ability to assemble the turbines that will be required.  That normally means within ports.  That work is going on and we are in constant communication with our colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We know the plans they have for rolling out the whole offshore wind energy piece and what is happening on that side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021102100002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>If I could come back to that last point where Mr. Burke said the officials are liaising with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, he has correctly highlighted we need ports designated to carry out this wind infrastructure.

It brings one to being shovel-ready.  In terms of CEF and the infrastructure and works, we are talking about 30%.  We have talked to Rosslare and met management, as we have with other ports, about the opportunities available under CEF.  I mentioned already that as we speak an information day is being hosted by the Department, with I think 50 potential applicants online.  The Commission is there, as is the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, CINEA, which is the body that evaluates these submissions.  The whole purpose of that is to generate interest in it and to facilitate people in making applications.  We know there is interest from our ports in making applications for this.  The closing date for calls is either the 9 January or the 19 January.  That work is ongoing.

I am not a member of the committee so I will not be deliberating on this.  However, Deputy Lowry will do so.  I would like to make a couple of points.  I share the concerns of the Chair.  We need to remember that Ireland is not joined to the European Continent.  We are divorced now to all intents and purposes from the UK.  The climate policy that is adopted will not impact on European states as it will impact on us.  The simple fact Ireland has to access gas through converters, for example, shows we do not have control of our energy supply.<\/p><p>I have major concerns about the level of joined-up thinking between the need for commercial delivery and the Department's wish to adopt European directives.  We are way behind in achieving our potential to roll out the wind energy aspirations we have.  We are well behind in terms of alternative fuels development in this country.  We will be importing all of this stuff and we will be subject to all the other costs coming from the EU.  We may not get the climate advantage.  The Chair is right to flag this issue.<\/p><p>The Department needs to be cognisant of what we are signing up for.  While we have passed our climate agenda and are committed to making these reductions, we cannot cut our own throats to be the best in class.  At the end of the day, we are a very small emitter globally of carbon and greenhouse gases, although our emissions <i>per capita<\/i>are high.  We need to reflect Ireland's position.  The Chair is taking the right point of view.  More information is needed.  What I would like to see, as Mr. Burke outlined at his symposium with many different actors coming in, is a high level of private engagement on these issues.  These are the people who will tell us straight off the bat where the real problems are.  I mean no disrespect to the Department and I know it is speaking to various people.

Someone who takes a car by ferry to France can be sure there will be a network of electric charging points available.  That information is available.  In the case of a ship, fuel can be picked up wherever it is needed.  In the case of an airline landing in an airport, whether in Paris or Estonia, the experience is the same.  To pick up on the Deputy's point, the alternative is that one has mismatch.  That is not what we want for businesses and consumers.  As an island nation, that common experience is not within our gift.  That is a very important reason for us.  Road hauliers will not cross to the Continent using electric vehicles unless certain they can be serviced on the far side.  It is that piece.  We can all do our piece individually but the individual pieces may not match into one coherent piece.  We need that coherent piece.<\/p> <p>  The other piece, which was already mentioned, is that in some cases the EU is leading the world on this.  That is particularly the case in the maritime area.  It sends a much more powerful message when the EU does this.  Within that, we have concerns.

It will not be down to the ship owners.  They could be impact by something over which they have no control, such as the availability of fuel.  All of this will be kept in mind as we work together.

There are a couple of points.  There are impact assessments for each of the COMs that have been published and I am sure the Department can pull them together for the committee.  They have been discussed at length among the member states at the Council working parties.  There are various views about how satisfied a member state is with the quality and level of detail.  It is very complex, to be fair to the European Commission.  It does not have them broken down by country.  In many respects, the Commission would say it is the mark of the member states to carry out a country analysis.<\/p> <p>  Generally among these files, the Commission is presenting them as the minimum member states must do to make sure there is consistency across the Community.  Every member state is grappling with different elements of it.  Few members have no difficulties with all of these.  While we have issues with aviation and maritime connectivity, the eastern European countries have difficulties overall in terms of GDP, affordability and the impact on their populations.  At the forefront of member states' minds is the impact on citizens, perhaps for political reasons, because of course one knows what happens when there is a detachment between public policy or government decisions and where populations are prepared to go.<\/p> <p>  It is important to distinguish between the setting of the targets and pathway and what member states individually might do to mitigate the impact of those targets on the population.  It is a top-line exercise to set the targets, for example, to determine how many electrical charging points we need across a European network and what is the right price of carbon, all of those elements.  There is a separate piece about how that will impact financially and socially on different demographics in different countries.  That varies across member states and within member states.<\/p><p>It primarily falls to national governments to work out who they will provide grants and social protection for.  It is a different suite of decisions and a real challenge.  The issues before us today concern the targets we need to hit to get to zero emissions by 2050.
