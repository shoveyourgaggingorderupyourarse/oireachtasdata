After lunch, the committee will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.

As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action or anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they do so.<\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

Its primary responsibility is to safeguard and improve the welfare of children.  Prior to 2014, most of the agency's functions were undertaken by the HSE.  Staff, assets and systems were transferred from the HSE to Tusla on its establishment, but the agency still relies on the HSE for support with certain functions, including procurement and ICT systems.<br\/><br\/>The agency's financial statements for 2020 record total income of around &euro;870 million, almost all of which comes from the Vote for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This includes &euro;17 million provided to support the agency's capital investment.  The agency's expenditure in 2020 was &euro;858 million.  Around one-third of the expenditure related to staff costs.  The agency employed around 4,600 whole-time equivalent staff at the end of 2020.<br\/><br\/>Most of the remaining expenditure in 2020 comprised direct payments or grant funding for the provision of services to support children and families.  This included &euro;119 million spent on foster care and aftercare allowances; &euro;142 million spent on independent placement provision, including residential care; and &euro;182 million paid as grants to organisations delivering a wide range of child and family services.  The agency incurred expenditure amounting to around &euro;30 million on guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>costs and legal fees.  The agency's office and administration expenses were &euro;36 million.<br\/><br\/>I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2020, which I certified on 30 June 2021.  However, I drew attention to two matters disclosed by the agency in its statement on internal control.  First, the agency acknowledges that in excess of &euro;6 million was spent on goods and services where the relevant public procurement rules were not complied with.  Second, as members are aware, the HSE suffered a ransomware cyberattack on its ICT systems in May 2021 resulting in the shutdown of all its ICT systems, including those supporting Tusla's operations.  In the statement on internal control, the agency outlines its plans to migrate its ICT systems away from the HSE network, except in respect of the HSE's integrated financial management system, IFMS, that is under development.  While the disruption to the agency's operations was significant, it happened after the period of account and does not impact the financial statements for 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Gloster to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#A00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear before them today.  I am joined as supporting witnesses by my colleagues, Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, and Ms. Kate Duggan, national director of services and integration and deputy CEO.  I have, as requested, provided the members with a short briefing document as an appendix to my opening statement and so I will confine my remarks here to some key themes.<\/p> <p>  The agency received referrals to its child protection and welfare service in 2020 at just below 70,000.  It is important to note that in the early stages of the Covid-19 response, we saw a concerning decrease.  I am satisfied this concern was proactively addressed and referral rates recovered.  Those children of specific levels of concern requiring a continuing social work service for a period were either at home - just over 15,000 - or in State care - 5,882 - at December 2020.<\/p> <p>  Not all referrals to the agency involve an abuse concern and many are welfare-based.  Some 22,300 of these children received a family support service in 2020 while 2,943 young adults received an aftercare service, including additional supports to reflect the context of the pandemic.  This is an area for further development.<\/p> <p>  The agency focused almost exclusively throughout the first months of the pandemic in ensuring the provision of domestic and sexual violence response services, child protection services and children in care supports.  In our specialist services separate to those above, 2020 saw key activity and statutory duties fulfilled in several ways.  Members will be aware of the repeated commentary on the ability of the agency to recruit staff and fill approved posts over recent years.  Tusla had developed an increasing dependence on temporary agency staffing.  A programme to convert these to Tusla employment took place in 2020 resulting in a reduction to a more appropriate level and a decrease in spend on agency staffing of &euro;19.5 million, which is continuing thus far to a saving of approximately &euro;4 million annually.  This has been maintained in 2021.  Our focus then shifted to improved graduate recruitment.<\/p> <p>  I also again note that concern for staff safety and welfare remains a priority in the context of understanding the staffing of the agency.  Within the workforce, social work recruitment and retention remains a serious challenge.  Generating supply is one area of activity.  The agency participates in the Department-led social work education group and, separately, the chair of the agency and I have engaged with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on this issue.  Increased supply and retention efforts alone will not deal with this issue, and there is a critical need to examine the utilisation of multidisciplinary teams for child protection and welfare work.  That noted, Tusla at the end of 2020 was effectively at full employment of its funded workforce, representing a substantial improvement on previous years.<\/p> <p>  Tusla is subject to regulatory oversight from several sources, including HIQA, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Health and Safety Authority, the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Information Commissioner and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Progress is being made in respect of the various functions that lead to more improved compliance, but there can be no doubting that challenges remain.  In respect of care and protection services, we have seen significant improvements in many HIQA reports while also remaining clear that some individual services or parts of them are found to be non-compliant, and this is concerning.<\/p> <p>  The agency concluded the year 2020 in a stable position financially through one-off adjustment and relative to the projected deficits cumulating from activity of previous years.  The target of the agency was to achieve a stable position coming into 2021, and thanks to the intervention of the Minister and the Department, this was achieved.  I am concerned regarding the long-term challenges for some of our funded organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  Efforts are continuing to mitigate those challenges to the greatest extent possible.  These organisations, many of them service providers, are critical to the effectiveness of the agency.  We did make some progress in 2020 and 2021 for this sector on a once-off basis.  However, the long-term solution to the challenge is beyond the scope of Tusla.<\/p> <p>  Eighteen out of the past 24 months during which I have been CEO of the agency have been characterised by two major events: Covid-19, and the cyberattack on HSE systems in May of this year.  The impact of both is still evident and well documented.  I am pleased to report to this committee that, notwithstanding these major disruptions, the board and the executive of the agency have remained focused on two key activities.  The first is the continuity of critical services to children and families throughout those events.  Tusla, as the State child protection agency, was identified by Government at the start of the pandemic and in the cyberattack as one of the key essential front-line services to be maintained.  Our response capability to each crisis was of a very high standard.<\/p> <p>  The second is the continuity of major changes and reforms within the agency.  These are in response to fundamental challenges.  On commencing my role, I agreed with the board that these were our priority and remain so.  I am pleased to report significant progress in key areas of change in the organisation.  At the end of this month, Tusla will have completed a major part of the reform of governance of the agency through the recruitment of a revised executive management team and six new defined regions, each with its own chief officer.  Through empowering local regions, we will see an even greater focus on need, better integration and improved performance management with appropriate accountability.<\/p><p>The board and I recognise that many challenges and issues remain to be addressed.  Be they in the context of history or current-day service provision, it is fair to say we have challenges.  I have no doubt some of those will be reported and commented on in the future.  Equally, there is substantial evidence to show we have made, and continue to make, progress on many fronts, with excellent work being done by some 5,000 staff every day.  Consistency and continuous improvement are central for the coming years.<\/p><p> I thank the Chair and am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gloster.

We have put in place a major contract around private residential services, which is around &euro;90 million per annum, that was completed across 2020 and 2021.  We have a major procurement under way around private foster care, which is due to be completed before the end of the year.

We have approximately 300 locations across the country in Tusla.  Cleaning, security, office supplies, etc., fall to those local areas.

Different circumstances will dictate the aftercare arrangements, but the rates for foster care arrangements for children up to the age of 18 are the same nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gloster and the other witnesses for joining us today.

I am not sure if Mr. Gloster is familiar with the Montague report, entitled Ballymun - A Brighter Future, which Dublin City Council published.

It pointed out that north Dublin city, which of course includes Cabra, Finglas and other areas, has the highest number of children in care in the country.

Our area manager in Dublin north city, Joy McGlynn, has been part of the inter-agency approach to that report in terms of its findings and recommendations.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, Dublin north city is one of the areas where we are significantly challenged in the profile of children and families who require our support and the profile of children and young people who touch off our system in terms of either family support or the care system.  The Deputy has also pointed out that Dublin north city has the highest number of children in care.  It also has the highest number of community and voluntary services within that region.  One of the areas we look at and focus on in Dublin north city is how to work much more collaboratively and work in partnership with our community and voluntary partners to respond to the need that is there.<\/p> <p>  Dublin north city, like the rest of the country, is challenged in terms of our ability to allocate an adequate number of social workers.<\/p><p>At the moment, the agency has a headcount of approximately 1,770 social workers.  However, we have a number of vacancies and that is compounded by the approximately 70 staff who are on maternity leave and, in the context of Covid-19, for health and safety reasons,k those staff are often working away from the front line from the beginning of their pregnancy.  Therefore, we are challenged our allocation of social workers across the country.<\/p><p> We are taking a number of actions.  We have already spoken about the agency conversion programme that has happened.  We are facilitating a number of student placements and our CEO is engaging with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in looking to increase the number of student placements.  We offered a permanent contract to every new graduate who was qualifying from the universities this year.  So far, out of 184 places in the universities, 130 individuals have expressed an interest in coming to work for Tusla.  After qualification and interview, that has translated into securing 99 additional social workers for the whole of the country, whereas 89 social workers left the agency between January and July this year.  Therefore, we are significantly challenged in our ability to allocate social workers.  In 2021, out of additional Government funding of approximately &euro;7 million, we allocated 65 new social work posts across the country, but the challenge remains.  The solution is around working with partner agencies and diversifying our workforce.  The Deputy talked about drugs and substance abuse issues and issues such as domestic violence in Dublin north city, and we are looking to diversify our workforce to meet that response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Ms Duggan has touched on two of the points in the report.  I am delighted to hear Tusla is more than familiar with the report and is participating in the inter-agency response.  I know it is something the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office is also involved in.  Regarding the two issues she touched on, recruitment is one element but retention is another.  In Dublin north city, 4% of cases are allocated within the 40 days whereas the national average for Tusla is 22%.  There is something else going on in Dublin north city and it is obviously to do with the difficulty of the work for many social workers and the retention issue.  The report points out that the appointment of more senior social workers would be one way of responding to that, giving people more responsibility, obviously, but also perhaps keeping them in post for longer.  I wonder if that is something Tusla has had an opportunity to consider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>That is a very fair observation.  There are myriad reasons it is difficult to retain staff.  We have invested a lot of energy this year in understanding fully the people who leave us with less than two years&rsquo; service and the people who leave with less than five years&rsquo; service, because it is in that band of years that the retention problem is.  People who leave after five years tend to leave for probably more understandable reasons.<\/p> <p>  I would point to a couple of factors.  First, pre-Covid, in Dublin city, in particular, it was difficult to attract social workers to come and stay.  There are some very good social workers in Dublin and we are delighted they are with us.  However, it is difficult to attract new social workers to come and stay given the cost of living and many different reasons, so that was one factor.<\/p> <p>  The other factor is there has been an increase among social work employers across the country in their demand for social workers.  This year, 184 people came off the courses in Ireland and 144 of them had registered with CORU by September, which means 40 are probably thinking about travel or something like that and 144 are available.  I could use every one of those and I did offer a job to every one of those who wanted a job.  However, my colleagues in the health service are recruiting social workers, the Probation Service recruits social workers, the section 38 agencies across the disability sector recruit social workers, and so on.  Social work has now become part of the multidisciplinary team in every health and social care context and that is a challenge for us.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that statutory child protection is considered to be one of the most hard-end areas of work to do.  While that is not to undervalue the work of anybody else, it is considered to be one of the hardest areas of social work to do.  I have said many times, including in my opening statement, that I think we have to move to a new model of multidisciplinary teams because there are lots of other disciplines and professions that could contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

I do not expect the witnesses to give me a commitment today but it might be something they consider and I will come back to them on this.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of diversifying, I would make two comments.  Youth workers, in particular those involved in school completion programmes, the family support agencies and family support centres, are a huge asset and should form part of that.  I was at an amazing event yesterday for Valerie O&rsquo;Carroll, the manager of the Ballymun Family Resource Centre who retired yesterday, a woman with a tireless commitment to Ballymun and a tireless commitment to social justice.  We hope her replacement will be just as good.  Having those people on the ground supports the social workers who are in place.  Sometimes, people in the school completion programmes and the family support centres feel like the Cinderella of Tusla and they do not feel they get the priority and resources they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that this year, for the first year in many, the school completion programmes got an increase.

That is why I said I am concerned about the sustainability of some of the services.  I have been out to Ballymun and Finglas and to some of the after-school clubs, and I know the Minister has been out there as well.

Is that a signalling of a policy shift?  What is the real-time position in respect of that?

In that interview, as in many others, I pointed to the fact that social care services in Ireland - in private nursing homes for the elderly, in the disability sector and in other areas - all have private provision.  There are some very good providers so I do not want to make this about disparaging any type of provision.  The point I was making in that article is very simply this: more than 60% of children in residential care are now dependent on private provision and that is far too significant a dependency for a sector that is populated by companies and organisations that can exit the market any time they choose to do so, or where other circumstances arise.  It is the level of dependency rather than the existence of the dependency.<\/p><p>The policy direction in Tusla is to come up with a plan, by the end of this year, to redress that balance and create more public provision.  That will take several years to achieve.  There is no doubt that we have reached the lowest number we will have in terms of children in residential care.  That number will probably increase slightly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions following on from that.  As I understand it, there is an entity called Positive Care, which is on Tusla's list of private providers.  A cursory look at the information for this organisation shows that it runs 13 or 14 houses.  Based on the ratios of staff to children, I conclude that there could be anything between 30 and 60 children being cared for across those services.  What does the future look like for an entity like Positive Care and why does such an organisation exist in the first instance?  It seems obvious that Tusla is not able to meet the provision it is required to deliver.  I am not trying to use loaded language here but such entities would not exist if Tusla, objectively speaking, were doing its job and making provision for those places within its own system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#F00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>If we were starting from a greenfield site in 2014, prior to my time, that would be the case and the Deputy's observation would be closer to being accurate.  However, we have to look at the context from which residential care provision came.  The extent of the growth of private provision is partly because the public sector, during more scarce times, did not invest in keeping public capacity at the level that was needed.  That is the first aspect.  The second point is that there has always been provision outside of the direct State provision.  There has been voluntary sector provision by NGOs, many of which had their origins in the religious orders that provided residential care in the past.  A large number of those organisations are no longer operating.  There are still some NGOs providing a service but part of that need was filled by the private sector.  When a State agency like Tusla is considering spending money on a service that it is not going to provide itself, EU procurement rules and all sorts of other rules, as we discussed, dictate that private providers are eligible to apply for that work.  There is a history and context to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that and I appreciate Mr. Gloster's response.

Approximately half, if not slightly more, of the total legal spend in the agency goes on guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>services and associated legal costs.  It is a very significant cost in any one year and we do not have control over it.  We have some control over the fees, and the agency made an effort to bring some balance in that regard a few years ago.  There was a lot of activity on the legislation prior to the Covid crisis and in the previous D&aacute;il.  The pandemic has impacted that, as has the legislative programme of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

In addition to that, the nature and type of crisis and work that arises in the course of an agency like Tusla added to the very significant events leading to the 2018 HIQA report, the Charleton tribunal and so on.  The agency became very centralised, very heavily dependent on the centre, to the point where there was no significant level of local autonomy and local authority, and all that goes with that.  The reform of the structure I pointed to is about correcting that imbalance.  That is just one part of many changes.

Yes, we have engagement with the universities at a number of levels.  Our chief social worker and his team are engaged with them at a developmental level.  The Department has a social work education group, which has the education sector on it also, and we are on that.  As I said in my opening statement, I have had engagement along with my chair with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  So they are all of the pieces to try and move it on.  To come to the core of the question, there were 184 graduates available from eight courses in Ireland this year and so far we are looking at a position where 144 registered with CORU.  That is what is available to Ireland and that is certainly the amount of available positions.  The need beyond Tusla exceeds that.<\/p> <p>  We did take some steps in recent years to try out different initiatives.  We did do a one-round scholarship programme with Maynooth University, which started a course.  We certainly got a reasonable yield out of that.  They are now continuing as a provider themselves.  We would look to sponsorship across the university sector in the future but it is something that we would have to get into more detailed planning about in terms of the cost and the return for it.<\/p> <p>  Again the chief social worker, who has a significant developmental role in social work practice in the agency, and his team, have put huge work into the provision of placements.  We have a high number of placement supervisors across our social work workforce.  We take a significant number of students.  Usually, half the students in training will come to Tusla for a placement either in the first or second year of their masters programme and then they go to other providers in disability services, mental health services and so on.  We, therefore, have very good placement capacity.  I have indicated to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that we could absorb another 50 placements if the colleges had those places in place to expand the supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1634805000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>In terms of the colleges, a number has been mentioned.

It is those types of initiatives for the future rather than just expecting the traditional courses to expand because there is demand in universities for expansion of lots of different programmes from social work to nursing and right across the spectrum of health and social services.

Without additional funding coming in, it did not look as though there was any prospect of new services being provided where there have been demographic shifts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021102100002#S00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634805000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I suspect the changes and variation across the country is in part due to some of the youth organisations that receive funding from Tusla participating in specific Tusla programmes.

It is a Department-led construct and the two would need to be put together to get the full picture.  I am certainly happy to come back to the Deputy with further detail.  As to the Deputy's point, no more than what I said earlier about people who could become very effective in the child protection, child welfare and family support systems in multidisciplinary teams, I include the youth sector in that.

The first is the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, for which there is a clear audit opinion.

I draw attention to a case of significant non-compliant procurement in that case.  This related to an ICT contract to develop a system for use by TG4 but it was not competitively procured. <\/p> <p>  No. 5 is the Social Insurance Fund and it is quite a significant account.  I can see that there is a typo there.  The turnover of the fund should be &euro;14.8 billion not &euro;14.8 million.  There is a clear audit opinion on this but I draw attention to two chapters from the report and the accounts of the public services.  Chapter 9 deals with regularity of payments and chapter 11 takes a deeper look at the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, the bulk of which was charged to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 6 and 7 are related.  These are the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal special account and the Hepatitis C and HIV compensation reparation fund.

Essentially, the HSE&rsquo;s position is that there are a range of unacceptable deficiencies and issues with the premises and it states that investment of significant funding into the building would still not bring it up to an acceptable accommodation standard for residents.

The Minister can be far-reaching in what he can do within the guidelines.  There are not sufficient limitations.  Public consultation would be one measure to provide a check or balance, allowing public input into, and scrutiny over, what a Minister might do under these guidelines.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about that.<\/p> <p>  If we do not plan properly and if the Minister is drawing up and issuing guidelines without consulting people, consider the damage that could be done to our cetaceans.

I refer to amendment No. 52 and to amendment No. 61 in particular, which also relates to directives.  I note that we now have policy statements, guidelines and directives.  Before all of that, we have plans.  I am trying to understand the relationship between these different things and the precise hierarchy and relationship between them.  It is fair to say that with all these different mechanisms for dictating by the Minister - because the Minister has the power to do these things - there seems to be a lot of power and many different avenues provided by the Minister to change things as they as move along.  As we will see in the next grouping, there is a requirement to comply with these policy statements, guidelines, and directives, if I understand correctly.  We have sought to delete line 35 in the subsequent group of amendments that we will deal with shortly.  These mechanisms will be available to the Minister to direct and to give guidelines, that is, issue instructions and give the Minister a hell of a lot of power.  One would worry about that sort of arbitrary power being given to the Minister.  While we may have great confidence in the Minister of State sitting here in the room with us, who knows what sort of Minister we might have in the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point is important as well.  Rightly and understandably, there is a huge need to address the climate crisis but the biodiversity crisis is not mentioned as often.  In fact, when one thinks about it deeply enough, a collapse in ecosystems could probably damage our ability to sustain our existence on this planet sooner than climate change.  The collapse of whole ecosystems could have disastrous and unknown consequences, because everything is connected.  We all depend on these interconnected chains called ecosystems.  The marine, marine life and marine biology are all critical to our existence on this planet.  There is a lot at stake, therefore.  By requiring public consultation on all of these things, we are ensuring that it will not just be a hell of a lot of power concentrated in the hands of a single Minister but that everybody, including all stakeholders and society generally ,would have a voice in this.  The Minister would have to meet many checks and balances in the objectives in developing the marine.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#C00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 48 proposes public consultation on any marine planning guidelines in line with the State's obligations under the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive and the Aarhus Convention.  By their nature, such guidelines will require strategic environmental assessment.  Integral to that process is public consultation.  Guidelines prepared without that assessment and consultation would not survive judicial review.  The term &ldquo;full public consultation&rdquo; is also technically problematic.  It is not a defined term and contains an inherent risk that any consultation, no matter how comprehensive, could be challenged on the basis that it is not full or complete.  Simply, direct and unspecific reference to the Aarhus Convention is not only unnecessary, it is legally problematic given the range of enabling legislation and European directives already in place giving effect to the principles set out therein.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 52 proposes that public consultation is undertaken for the making, amending or revocation of any guidelines.  This is an overly onerous and restrictive provision.  It would oblige public consultation on the correction of even a single typographical error.  Any amendment to the guidelines will be subject to SEA screening, and full SEA including public consultation, if required.  There may also be a need to urgently amend any guidelines resulting from emergent case law, both domestic and European.  Guidelines would normally be revoked where a new set of superseding guidelines are developed.  It would not be practical or best use of resources to hold a separate consultation specifically on revocation.  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 61 proposes public consultation on every directive or amendment or revocation.  By their very nature, directives may be needed urgently to ensure the legally robust functioning of the marine planning system.  Directives issued under this section will be subject to obligations under section 31 in respect of appropriate assessment, AA, and strategic environmental assessment, SEA.  If such assessments are screened in, public consultation will be undertaken as a matter of course and existing obligation.  I therefore oppose these amendments.<\/p> <p>  There appears to be a misunderstanding of the purpose of these guidelines and policy directives.  They are used to ensure that the system that is being designed here operates as intended.  They will be drawn up and will operate within the policy framework, as set up in the national marine planning framework that has been approved by the Oireachtas.  They are there to make it work.  They are also there to show specific public bodies how they can comply with the policies and objectives of the national marine planning framework, maritime spatial plan, or designated marine area plans, DMAPS.  Moreover, in some extreme cases, they can direct them to act in a certain way in order to comply with these policies or with emerging case law.  They are created in a system that is designed around the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive, has also had regard to the marine strategy framework, MSF, directive and the principles established in the Aarhus Convention, as already transposed in Ireland.  The SEA and AA-related directives already apply to them by reference to section 31 of the Bill.  It is simply not necessary to restate these things in every Part of this Bill; it is unwieldy and would have a myriad of unintended consequences.  In addition, there appears to be a perception that the Government is currently avoiding consultation with the public generally.  That simply could not be further from the truth.  Consultation and, more appropriately, participation occur in a variety of ways.  To give the most recent example of guidelines that I published under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, namely, the draft development plan guidelines for planning authorities, these were placed on public display for the acceptance of submission from 13 August 2021 to 8 October 2021, a period of almost nine weeks.  However, to get to that point, a high degree of consultation with various stakeholders was carried out.  This was to ensure their operational effectiveness.  Appropriate consultation does take place in respect of such guidance already.  It will continue to do so under the provisions drafted, where appropriate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#C00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It was stated that these would mean a correction of a typo would require public consultation.  That is a bit of a stretch and nobody would suggest that these amendments would mean that the correction of a typo would require public consultation.  The general understanding is that any material changes would require public consultation but that a typo correction would not.  The Minister of State might give some examples of where typo corrections require public consultation, seeing as that is his stated position on this.  I do not accept that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State also indicated that there would need to be a separate consultation on the revoking of guidelines.  At the same time, he states that the revoking of guidelines would nearly always happen in conjunction with new guidelines being introduced.  It is quite clear that where new guidelines are being introduced and other guidelines are being revoked, there could be a consultation process on the revoking of guidelines and introduction of new guidelines if it is all part of the same process.  Given that the Minister of State argues that it would be a rare scenario for guidelines to just be revoked on their own without new guidelines being introduced, the scenario about which he is worried - the revocation of guidelines requiring a separate consultation - would not frequently arise, if ever.<\/p> <p>  I have the same concerns about the Minister of State's indication that there will only be public consultation after a screening process, especially with regard to directives.  These amendments specifically seek public consultation in all scenarios.  Between these guidelines, the directives and the policy statements, there is so much leeway for a Minister to set the direction and the impact it can have.<\/p> <p>  If the guidelines are of significance, and they will be, the Minister will not set them for no reason.  We have seen in other planning areas where guidelines can have a major impact.  Whether a screening process decides public consultation is required or not, it is very clear that public consultation is needed given that these guidelines will be of significance.  They are significant enough to be in the legislation we are discussing now and what is to be put on a statutory basis.  Given the extent of the powers, they are significant enough to go to public consultation as part of a system of checks and balances on these quite strong powers that the Minister is to be given with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#D00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will try to be nice in what I say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#D00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>We are in public session as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#D00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The Minister of State knows quite well that we are not talking about typos and that our concern is that guidelines which could have a real, substantial and material impact should be subject to a requirement for public consultation.

Directions involve being more explicit because the Minister will be directing a particular course of events.  For instance, in the event that an entity such as the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, does not do what the policy says it should do, the Minister may issue a direction to ensure that it does so.  Guidelines are more subjective.  We have offshore renewable energy guidelines, for example.  Guidelines involve trying to guide the decision-making process to get the best outcome, whereas a direction is more specific and clear.  That is my best attempt at explaining.

As for my suggestion, on which the Minister of State seemed to look somewhat favourably the last time, in addition to what we have proposed in these amendments about newspapers and other forms of publications, one can take it as a standing request from me to consider radio ads for all of these things.  When we are discussing the notification of the public, we need to think about other means of getting over the fact the public just do not know.  They do not see these newspaper ads and so on.  The point is to let everybody in the Oireachtas and the public know; ensure the Oireachtas votes on it and has input into these guidelines and directives and the public is aware of them and has opportunities to make its views known.

We will not repeat the whole debate we had previously.  Some of us would like to hear, and something with which the Minister of State is familiar because he does it with us regularly in committee, when there are changes to certain aspects of planning policy that there is a procedure where they are brought in at least to an Oireachtas committee and there is a discussion and a motion with or without debate to clear those through.  I am not proposing that same mechanism, but what motivated the three of us here who put our names to this is we would like to see some greater role.  The Minister of State's officials will have advised him this is a far too onerous set of requirements we are setting out and he will not support those, but is there willingness to conceive of some formal role or process for the Oireachtas to be involved in this, in the way we often are?  Solar panels or some of the emergency measures introduced in planning about on-street dining and such are examples.  Some of those are planning guidelines.  How can we better involve the Oireachtas?  If the Minister of State is rejecting what we proposed, which we know he is, and that is his absolute right, can he at least take the spirit of what we are talking about and examine it?  There is merit in engaging with the collective experience of the Oireachtas and members of relevant committees, but also for public confidence in those guidelines because of the involvement of committee and public transparency etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#H01700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":537,"content":"<p>This grouping of amendments proposes similar Oireachtas engagement procedures for guidelines and directives to those proposed earlier for the marine planning policy statement, MPPS, and are equally problematic.  The net effect of the proposals would be that the Oireachtas would take the role of the Minister of the day on a day-to-day operational level of the planning regime.  The Oireachtas is not and cannot be the marine spatial planning body.  The text is largely copied from those earlier amendments and, as such, contains the same technical deficiencies as already debated.<\/p> <p>  The requirement for such detailed engagement with the Oireachtas would limit the finalisation of such documents to the periods in which the Oireachtas was sitting and had the available capacity to deal with such matters.  Such a restriction brings with it the problematic risk of the entire marine planning system grinding to a halt during periods in which the Oireachtas was not sitting or did not have capacity where a guideline or directive was necessary to ensure legally robust functioning of the planning system.  That would be an unprecedented constraint for any regulatory system and I sincerely doubt people would thank us for introducing it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 54 sets out the process for the Oireachtas approval, which is entirely inappropriate for ministerial guidelines and would be inconsistent with other provisions on the Statute Book.  Amendment No. 60 limits such guidance to the consideration of specific matters which are in the formulation of an amendment that has already been rejected.  Amendment No. 64 again sets out an Oireachtas process entirely at odds with the purpose of a ministerial function.  Amendment No. 71 sets out limits on such directives to the consideration of such matters which are in the formulation of an amendment already rejected.

This gets to the nub of it.  If we got clarity on this we could move through this Bill much more quickly.  Is it correct that these directives would require that before consents for development are given, the directives are fully complied with, which is what Europe wants, and then we can move to the issue of applications, consents, enforcement and all the rest of it but in the first instance we must have a plan, which must be compliant with the various directives?  Rightly or wrongly, we have a concern that there may be development consents given where those plans are not fully in place.  In particular, the relevant projects could get consents when plans are not in place.  How would that stand in respect of the directives?  That is one of our central concerns and one of the central concerns of people looking in here.  If we could get clarity, it would help.  Have people reason to be concerned?  The ideal would be to have the marine plan, which is similar to a development plan.  We know what can be done here and there and people will only be allowed do things in those places.

What is encompassed by maritime spatial planning must be clearly set out in the Bill, and it is very important we do it so we do not end up before national and EU courts and create potential delays in marine activity.  It is essential we have sufficient marine protection with an emphasis on rehabilitation and conservation, which we are legally obliged to deliver.  We should already have delivered that and we have been remiss in not putting in place sufficient marine protection, rehabilitation and conservation.  We must move very swiftly to ensure we do that.<\/p><p>There are other complex environmental considerations that must also be taken into account in spatial planning.  This is not discretionary, and that is why I spoke before about the importance of the directives relating to marine planning in that respect.  They are legal requirements and are not discretionary.  That is why it is important with the directives to understand the difference between transposition of a directive and conformity with directives.  That relates to our previous conversation and it is why there are checks both on transposition and conformity.  Of course, conformity is all about compatibility.  What I was seeking in previous amendments was to ensure compatibility and what I am trying to do with this amendment is ensure compatibility as well.<\/p><p>I can give an example of good practice from another jurisdiction that relates to marine rehabilitation and conservation.  Scotland has set up the Scottish marine environmental enhancement fund.  It is a very good model and something we should do here.  All wind and renewable energy in the marine environment has a condition of the licence that there must be a contribution to the fund.  The fund is used to support communities, environmental and coastal groups that work in the marine and it allows them to carry out marine biodiversity projects, along with conservation and rehabilitation.<\/p><p>It is very important we write into the Bill as much as possible measures that will lead to that sort of good practice seen in Scotland.  That is why I am putting forward these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021102100002#S02400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1634770800,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Given we have only a few minutes left, I reserve the right to come back on some of the latter amendments in this group as I will only get to the first few.<\/p> <p>  Again, some of my questioning is really just an invitation for the Minister of State to explain the intricacies of this process a little more on the public record.  Most of us have experience of terrestrial planning and we know the planning framework is the overarching strategy.  There are also county and city development plans and local area plans, with ministerial guidelines in between, some of which are controversial and some of which are not.<\/p> <p>  I am understanding it better as we go through this process but we have a marine planning policy statement, a marine planning framework and then maritime and spatial plans.  We will get on to designated marine area plans, DMAPs, in a later section.  Specifically with the maritime spatial plan, I am still not clear what it brings to this part of the architecture that is not already in the other elements.  My understanding is it may be geographically more limited and there may be some more detail.<\/p> <p>  At an earlier stage the Minister of State said there is no plan as detailed as the marine planning framework.

Let me get back to the detailed point because this is important.  With a county development plan, for example, we have all the land uses mapped out and agreed.  This is pertinent to the session we will have with the other Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, around marine protected areas, because until we have those or the interim measures, there will be a missing piece in the jigsaw.  In the Minister of State's response to amendment No. 73, will he delineate what is the maritime spatial plan as distinct from the bits above and below it?
