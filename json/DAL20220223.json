This was to serve the western region as a psychiatry of later life day hospital and a child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, Connect, that is, to serve the needs of both young and old.<\/p>  <p>  I first began asking questions in late 2020 on the staffing levels at the hub and the services that were available.  One reply from the HSE on 7 December 2020 advised me that one post had been filled and it was at recruitment stage with three posts out of a total of 21 posts.  After further questions and a number of meetings in 2021, it then became apparent &ndash; unbelievably so &ndash; that no funding had been provided at that point for 2021.  This was not common knowledge until I raised it in the House on a number of occasions last year.  At that point, in July 2021, the Minister of State made a funding announcement more than halfway through the year.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously asked the Minister of State my first question and I hope that she will answer it today.  Why was funding for the e-mental health hub not continued into 2021?  Why did it take until July 2021 for an announcement to be made, given there were no posts in place, the vast majority were vacant and there were no services available?  Almost two years on now from the opening, the latest information I have is that five posts out of the seven for the psychiatry of later life remain unfilled and there are three posts vacant for CAMHS Connect.  I also hope the Minister of State will be able to tell me what services are being provided in the e-mental health hub today, if the psychiatry of later life day hospital is functioning, and if it is not, when it will be.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will know that before it became an e-mental health hub, this was the Rosalie home.  It was a home to dementia patients and older people with dementia.  They had been promised by a previous Government they would be allowed to see out their days in that home.  That promise was reneged on.  They were sent all over the place to different nursing homes.  Their families were absolutely distraught.  It was incredible how they, our most vulnerable citizens, were treated.  It has been difficult to see that replaced and opened with great fanfare and not even funded by the HSE, particularly the psychiatry of later life given the importance of that service, especially in a county such as Roscommon where we have an older population.  When it comes to health services, the people of Roscommon feel like the poor relation.<\/p>  <p>  This, unfortunately, is yet another example of something state of the art and one of its kind that opened in Castlerea in Roscommon and not funded.  Today, almost two years on, we still have posts that are vacant.  There is no excuse for this.  Had funding been put in place and continued into 2021 and there was a real effort made to fill those posts throughout last year rather than leaving it until more than midway through the year, we would not be in this position today.  There are no guarantees we would.  These are important services for young and old for the western region.  If this is a state-of-the-art service, then it needs to be funded continually.  We need to get the posts filled and we need to get those services in place.  They are very important.<\/p>  <p>  I had a message from a lady in Ballinasloe the other day.  She just messaged me basically to query and raise the fact of the number of young people committing suicide.  It is incredible.  We need the supports there for young people and older people.  We need them as quickly as possible.  This should not have taken until now to get these posts filled.  They should have been filled.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300003#A00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1645607520,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The e-mental health project was launched by the T&aacute;naiste in mid-2020.  Two main elements were identified for development as part of the Castlerea hub: a CAMHS Connect telehealth service and CAMHS day hospital.  In addition, a psychiatry of later life day hospital was also identified.<\/p>  <p>  Work was progressed by the HSE through 2020, including capital works and initial recruitment of staff.  This involved expenditure in the region of &euro;400,000 for refurbishment and &euro;400,000 for staff.  The hub was further developed in 2021 in the context of overall funding allocated for mental health that year, including further recruitment of staff.  For 2021, 14 posts are approved, with &euro;1.4 million in revenue allocated.  This is real money.  It is there to hire staff and there was no ambiguity about that.  For 2021, 14 posts are approved and it is expected to be fully staffed in 2022.  It is the first of its kind nationally and will form the core of the new Castlerea mental health hub across HSE West.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question, the CAMHS day hospital is operating on a seven-day basis and currently serves counties Mayo and Roscommon.  The team is flexible and provides intensive home-based treatment and assertive outreach, as required, which has been very important over the past two years when we have had the challenges of Covid.  Provision of evidence-informed psychological and talking therapies form the cornerstone of supports provided, which include family therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and similar service approaches.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE indicates that the latest position on the CAMHS Connect service and day hospital is that approval has been received at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level for the following posts: consultant psychiatrist, non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, advanced nurse practitioner, ANP, senior social worker, clinical nurse specialist, senior psychologist and senior occupational therapist.  The consultant, NCHD, ANP, and senior social worker for this team have all been recruited and the remaining three posts are at an advanced stage of recruitment.  This facility has core mental health staff and telepsychiatry facilities to enable remote consultations.  This is essential for Roscommon, which has experienced significant difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff.<\/p>  <p>  On the psychiatry of later life day hospital, an NCHD and a senior psychologist have been recruited.  The remaining posts are going through the recruitment process at present and will be filled as soon as possible.  These posts are for a consultant psychiatrist, advanced nurse practitioner, social worker, clinical nurse specialist and a senior occupational therapist.  We have to point out that the HSE is experiencing challenges in recruiting staff across mental health and, more broadly and in fact, this is an international issue as well.  All these positions are funded.  The &euro;1.4 million was allocated to put in place all these staff in the Castlerea hub.<\/p>  <p>  The psychiatry of later life day hospital will provide medical, nursing, occupational therapy, social work and psychology services.<\/p> <p>The aim is for the day hospital to be the new base for the team and to provide a service five days a week.  It also aims to provide a service to Roscommon-north Galway and to provide separate programmes for those with functional mental health difficulties and those with dementia who attend on different days.  On the broader front, the development of all aspects of our mental health services nationally remain a priority for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300003#A00500","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645608120,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The Minister of State said work was progressed by the HSE, including initial recruitment in 2020, but by 7 December one consultant had been recruited - just one.  There was nothing significant in regard to work progressed at that time.  The real question is why funding was allocated in 2020 for the recruitment of staff and was then gone in January 2021.  That is the main question.  We deserve answers as to why that happened.  I appreciate there are posts outstanding and there are issues in regard to recruitment and retention.  I acknowledge that.  However, there was a long gap from January to July 2021 when there was no funding and the hub was simply sitting there.  That is not good enough and I want to know why that happened.  I also want to know if funding at the present level will continue annually into the future to ensure we do not see that happen again.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about the psychiatry of later life element.  Two posts were filled last October.  Five posts remain unfilled today and that is of concern.  We need to see that element of the hub opened as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister of State to look in particular at that psychiatry of later life element.  The CAMHS part is important.  There are three vacancies there.  Given the role the Rosalie Home played in the community of Castlerea, that element of psychiatry of later life for our older people is very important.<\/p>  <p>  Again I ask why funding was dropped or not continued into 2021.  Why did it take until July last year for funding to be put in place when we had a state-of-the-art hub where no vacancies were filled and no services were available by the end of 2020?

In 2021, we moved very quickly to put in place &euro;1.4 million to allocate staff.  It takes a while to put staff in place.  This Castlerea hub is a fantastic hub and I am delighted to say I secured funding in this year's budget to continue the roll-out of telehealth hubs.  We are going to see a further one in Cork and a further one in Limerick this year.  Because of Covid-19 and the challenges with staffing in certain areas, it is important for young people to be able to access telehealth hubs.<\/p>  <p>  I visited Castlerea before Christmas.  I went along and met the staff that actually do exist and I spoke to them.  On that particular day, young people availed of services.  I visited the psychiatry of later life.  There have been challenges with staffing, but psychiatry of later life is so important.  Even in this year's budget I moved to get funding for three pilot sites to incorporate psychiatry of later life with integrated care programmes for older people, ICPOPs, that are being rolled out throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Castlerea hub is the cornerstone of how we are moving now in regard to care for young people, care for teenagers.  It will be funded going forward.  It pains me that it takes quite a while to get staff in place, especially when the posts are funded.

I acknowledge a huge amount of work has been done, but the issue is that there are primary schools in these communities that are closed every evening at 3.30 p.m.  My argument is these should be open and made available to the public.

What I am arguing for is that these guidelines should be reissued.  The Minister of State with responsibility for community development could engage with the Department of Education and with communities and add his voice to this issue to make these schools available.

First, the education and training boards, which are entirely within the State remit, should develop a best practice model of opening up their premises to flexible use in all sorts of areas such as childcare, youth work and so on.  Second, all school patrons should have to provide, as an integral part and a condition of any application for an extension of their premises or improvement works, a policy on how they are going to open those facilities to wider use.  That could be a very important nudge.  Third, the Department of Education should work with other Departments to develop the campus concept with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media so that schools in our communities become genuine campuses of activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300004#B00600","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1645608120,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Ultimately our people look to us as policymakers to provide leadership in the area of enhancing community life and well-being in general.

In recent months we have seen some interesting collaborations between schools and local sports clubs, supported through the sports capital grant scheme.  We can leverage much of that in the future.  There is a significant opportunity to build on that kind of collaboration.  Ultimately, that needs school authorities and patrons to open their doors to local school communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300004#B00700","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1645608120,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter in regard to enabling access to school facilities for use by local community organisations and youth groups outside of school hours.  Schools are very much valued in their communities in that they provide a vital link to sports and social activity but also to local heritage, and in rural areas they help sustain populations.  Indeed rural schools make up the majority of our primary school sector.  Nearly 2,000 out of just 3,200 of the State's primary schools are in rural areas.  Schools are often the centre of community activity and there can be mutual benefits in building links with the local community.  Indeed many schools recognise this and play an important role in the wider community and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of community and other activities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies may be aware, the policy of the Department of Education is that school premises and facilities should be used for community and recreational purposes, where possible.  In October 2017, following consultation with the relevant school authorities, the Department published guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours.  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide information for schools in regard to the use of school buildings outside of school hours and for those schools that are considering putting such arrangements in place.  Any decision to make school facilities available lies with the relevant trustees or property owners, having regard to the requirements of the school, staff and students.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through its policies and funding interventions, continues to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  In regard specifically to playgrounds, public green space and public parks, which are all key to community well-being, the following supports are available.  My Department provides funding for the development and upgrading of playgrounds under LEADER, CL&Aacute;R, and the community enhancement programme.  The community enhancement programme provides small capital grants to community groups to enhance facilities, including playgrounds in disadvantaged areas.  From 2018 to mid-2021, &euro;29.7 million has been provided in funding for the community enhancement programme, supporting more than 10,000 community groups and organisations.  Funding is allocated by my Department to each local authority area.  The local community development committee, LCDC, with support from its local authority, administers the funding.  Some &euro;4.5 million was available in 2021, with &euro;145,203 allocated to Mayo and &euro;156,299 allocated to Cork, for example.<\/p> <p> From my own Department's perspective, funding has been provided under the CL&Aacute;R programme for a range of measures to be delivered by schools and communities, including for the enhancement or development of play areas and multi-use games areas, MUGAs.  The conditions attached to the CL&Aacute;R programme require that such facilities should be available for wider community use.  In the case of schools, I appreciate that the use of play areas and MUGAs by the general community may need to be restricted to times outside of normal school hours.  Many schools in CL&Aacute;R areas are willing to make their playground facilities available for community use and have received support under the programme on this basis.  The objective is that these facilities would be available to local families and visitors to the area.<\/p> <p> Under measure 2 of CL&Aacute;R 2021, &euro;2.3 million in funding was provided to support outdoor community recreation facilities, including playgrounds.  Emerging from this call, my Department recently announced funding for 20 playgrounds, both new and upgrades to existing playgrounds.  We expect to launch the next round of CL&Aacute;R funding shortly.<\/p> <p> LEADER can also fund the renovation of community centres, playgrounds and other community amenities, which play a very important role in community development.  My Department is also responsible for a number of national policies containing measures to improve the lives of people throughout the country, including Our Rural Future, which places an emphasis on building resilience and enhancing participation and inclusion in rural communities.  The availability of suitable spaces for use by local communities is an important element of supporting inclusion and participation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300004#B00800","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645608720,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We are all agreed on the principle that we should sweat the asset, for want of a better way of putting it, and that schools should be used outside of school hours as much as possible for all the activities communities need.

I am also aware of the recent provision of a new funding stream under the Brexit adjustment fund for piers and harbours, as recommended by the Seafood Task Force.  Unfortunately, it is hard to see how emergency repair works such as are needed in Polawaddy would properly fit the bill under this fund.<\/p>  <p>  Our inshore fishing sector relies on piers, slipways and harbours, such as Polawaddy, and they have been hit hard by successive Governments due to restrictions and bans being placed on the types of fishing they can engage in.  Yet many are still engaged full time in the sector and draw their sole income from it.  It is beyond a job for these people; it is a way of life, one that has more than just an economic value to be placed on it.  There is also the culture and heritage value of the traditional fisheries which utilise such local infrastructure.  These aspects were recognised by the Minister's party, in opposition, when it wholeheartedly supported the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill.  I hope that recognition survived the transition across the floor to sit with Fine Gael.<\/p>  <p>  On a serious note, the main reason I bring this issue to the Minister's attention today is the immediacy of the funding need in this case.  I ask that he look to make a one-off allocation of emergency funding to cover the cost of repair and ancillary works required to protect from a similar occurrence.  Perhaps he could do so in collaboration with his ministerial colleague in the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government.  Will the Minister commit in the House today to engage directly with the marine engineering section in Donegal County Council and commit to funding the costs of these repairs?<\/p>  <p>  Paramount to what I ask for today are two things - speed of decision and a straightforward yes-no answer to bring back to our constituents.  Speed of decision is an urgent matter because this happened unexpectedly, and the slipway needs to be got back into operation as soon as possible.  Perhaps works could be carried out at the same time to protect the pier from future storms as well.  A straightforward yes-no answer would be very important as well, as Donegal County Council would know where it stands and it could begin to plan what is also needed to be done.  It would be vitally important for it to know that this would be done.  The storm damage is exceptional.  It is a one-off event.<\/p> <p>The Department should be able to take that on board and make this right for the people of Arranmore as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300005#C00700","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645609320,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising in the D&aacute;il the need to address the damage done to Pollawaddy pier.  I am glad to be able to provide a broad overview of the work I and my Department are doing to support Donegal County Council and other local authorities in terms of improving our small piers and harbours.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Pollawaddy slipway, I have spoken to the county manager, John McLaughlin, on the matter.  The county council be will be assessing the case.  I have no doubt the county council engineer, Cathal Sweeney, who does tremendous work throughout the county in terms of maintenance and development of our small piers and harbours and is an Arranmore islander, is very much on top of this case in terms of assessing the impact of the damage.  The Department has not yet been formally notified of the impact of the damage.  In the first instance, as it is a local authority managed pier, it is a matter for the local authority to assess and to identify the repair challenges and how they can be addressed.  In terms of my role in this area and that of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, if we get any feedback from the county council on the challenges, we will engage.  It is important this key pier and harbour is repaired.  It is crucial for the islanders in terms of the fishing sector there and for the inshore fishers in the work they carry out and who need to be able to get on with their livelihoods in a safe manner.<\/p>  <p>  No more than Deputy Pringle, the inshore sector is one I value and support, which we have to do.  It can be a difficult lifestyle and livelihood but it is a really important part of our heritage and economy, in particular a really important part of our island economy.  Pier and infrastructure funding is crucial in that regard.  Last year, I announced record funding for small piers and harbours throughout the country.  As mentioned by Deputy Pringle, Donegal received the highest allocation of any county in respect of its piers and harbours.  A few weeks ago, for the first time ever, I announced a support scheme that delivers &euro;4,000 for inshore fishers with boats longer than 8 m and &euro;2,800 for smaller vessels, again as a means of supporting inshore fisher incomes.  Crucial to their income is having the capacity, the facilities and the infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is putting huge emphasis on the development of our piers and harbours, in particular their availing of the opportunity under the Brexit adjustment reserve.  I have been engaging with my Cabinet colleagues on an ongoing basis on how we leverage the available funding to maximise the benefit in every way we can for small piers and harbours and that infrastructure.  There has been a real challenge in terms of the quota impact arising from Brexit.  We fought to represent our national sector in every way possible.  Coming out of that, we want to build, support and fund the sector.  We want to ensure the infrastructure is there and to develop the piers and harbours.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Pollawaddy, it was impacted by Storm Franklin.  It was a very challenging night across Donegal in terms of infrastructure.  It was a particularly challenging night, as the Deputy will know, for mica homeowners as well.  It was very distressing for everyone.  A reflection of the impact of the storm was the damage done at Pollawaddy.  As I said, the local authority is assessing the damage and, as Minister, I will engage with it in any way I can to be supportive of ensuring the repairs are completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300006#D00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1645609320,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the overview in regard to the piers and harbours.  There are two aspects to this, that is, the ongoing maintenance in terms of the Brexit reserve fund, which was mentioned by the Minister, and normal Government funding for piers and harbours.  Donegal may have received the largest allocation, but as it has the highest number of piers, that makes sense.  It is a pity we had to have a Minister from Donegal to ensure that would be recognised.  It is at least recognised now.  It is to be hoped that will continue.<\/p>  <p>  In this instance, we need once-off funding.  That is important.  The Minister has gone some way towards recognising that.  I acknowledge he has spoken to the county manager and he is awaiting a report from the local authority.  The Minister will need to put pressure on the council to ensure it reports back to him.  It will then be a matter for the Department because the council would not have the resources to deal with this.  I urge the Minister to keep the pressure on Donegal County Council, as we all will do, in regard to a timely report and to ensure, following on from that report, that funding will be made available.

I have no doubt it will engage as appropriate with me and the Government in regard to the challenges there.  It is important the work to repair the pier is carried out as promptly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The islanders will be well represented in terms of engaging with Donegal County Council.  The Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation is a very important producer organisation on behalf of inshore fishers.  Last year, I worked hard to ensure it got producer organisation status, which I believe is a big step forward for our inshore fishers and for islanders in particular.  Since it has received full producer organisation status, the chairman, Jerry Early, and chief executive officer, Seamus Bonner, have been tremendous advocates on our national fishing scene for islanders and inshore fishers.  I have no doubt they will be engaging and working with the local authority to have this particular issue regarding Pollawaddy pier fully considered.  Local councillor, Noreen McGarvey, has been in touch with me specifically on this issue as well to highlight the importance of a prompt resolution.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Pringle for raising this matter in the D&aacute;il.  It is important there is an acknowledgement of the importance of these piers and harbours on our islands in particular, that they are recognised on the floor of the D&aacute;il as being very important, and that we all then work together to ensure the infrastructure and facilities in place are appropriate to supporting our inshore fishers in carrying out their livelihoods.  Following on from the storms such as we have seen, it is important we act promptly.  I know Donegal County Council will do that.

This was revolutionary for businesses in light of the Covid-19 restrictions.  It also greatly improved the atmosphere of the city and was the start of a return to some sort of normality for both the business community and the people of Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this decision involved the relocation of several disabled parking spaces, but this was done with little consultation with the disabled community.  Eighteen months later, we are still awaiting a resolution in regard to the relocation of these disabled parking spaces.  Ordinary parking spaces, with no ramps or extra space, have been painted blue and designated disabled parking; there are bollards blocking ramps on to the footpaths and, most dangerously, people with disabilities have to exit their cars onto really busy roads.  Despite intervention by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and continuous calls from me to rectify this situation, these issues have not been addressed.<\/p>  <p>  There is engagement by Cork City Council with the voluntary group, Cork Access Group.  Realistically these are volunteers but they do their best.  They are being involved on a statutory basis but they are not having the impact they should have on planning and they are not being involved at the concept stage.<\/p> <p>Public realm planning is a vitally important aspect of how we live, move, shop and survive in cities, towns and villages.  Changes to the public realm often have unforeseen consequences but more and more, these consequences are falling unfairly on the accessibility of spaces.  I am simply asking that when local authorities undertake public realm planning they do so with accessibility in mind.  They should undertake and publish an accessibility impact study prior to public consultation.  This would allow them to see whether disabled parking needs to be moved and whether footpaths will be narrowed or become shared.  Consideration must be given to the use of tactile paving because at the moment in Cork, some tactile paving is being used as decoration.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, Cork was found to be the best European city for economic potential.  This is welcome but we cannot build a city and a prosperous economy if it does not include everyone in our society, especially those with a disability.  The guidelines exist.  We have the UNCRPD, the universal design guidelines, the Blind Guide and the NTA's own walkability audit.  Local authorities have the tools but they are not all using them.  The Government must make sure that when we improve our public spaces we improve them for everyone.

The ongoing implementation of disability-related measures has a statutory footing under the Disability Act 2005.  The Act comes within the policy remit of my colleague Deputy Rabbitte, who is Minister of State with responsibility for disability at the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Act is a legislative framework which enables and places obligations on Ministers and other public bodies to provide services and related measures to meet the needs of people with disabilities, consistent with available resources.  I am providing this summary of the Act solely for context and understanding.  Deputy Rabbitte would be the appropriate person to speak about this legislation.  However, I take on board the Deputy's point that this is a local government issue.<\/p>  <p>  To support people who may have particular needs, section 26 of the Disability Act 2005 requires the authorisation of at least one officer of a public body to provide, or arrange for and co-ordinate, assistance and guidance to people with disabilities in accessing its services.  This officer is referred to as an \"access officer\" in the Act.  Associated costs must be met in the course of the normal operations of the public body.  Until recently, the access officer in my local authority was the county architect.  Other provisions of Part 3 of the Disability Act provide for accessible public buildings where practicable, the compulsory provision of accessible information and services and access to heritage sites.  The National Disability Authority has produced codes of practice that are designed to assist public bodies in meeting these obligations.  Where a person believes that the provisions of the Act are not being properly adhered to, section 38 entitles specified persons to make a complaint in writing to the head of the public body in question, and outlines the procedures for such a complaint.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the provisions under Part 3 of the Act, there are requirements for new buildings, and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings, to comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the building regulations 1997-2019.  In this context, the building regulations relating to Part M and the accompanying technical guidance document on access and use, which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that buildings must achieve.  Part M aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design.  Guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability is available in Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach, which is published by the centre for excellence in universal design at the National Disability Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The issues the Deputy has raised this morning relate to the public realm and the reconfiguration of public streets during Covid.  He quite rightly mentioned the loss of disabled parking spaces.  That is something for each individual local authority to deal with.  Where a disabled parking space is removed they are obliged to reinstate them in other parts of the urban area.  Pedestrianisation in itself is good for people with disabilities because it provides safe spaces for people of all abilities to enjoy towns and urban centres.  There are a number of things that other local authorities, including my own, have done in recent years to try to improve public accessibility.  It is not just about people with physical disabilities.  People with intellectual disabilities require good, safe urban spaces as well.  I will try to address that specifically in my summary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300007#E00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1645609920,"counter":34,"content":"<p>There is an accessibility officer in the council.

We need a full-time position of disability officer.  I proposed this in a motion to Cork City Council a number of years ago.  I am being fobbed off because there is an access officer available.  I am asking for a disability officer in every local authority.  The current accessibility officer does not seem to have any role in planning.  They do not seem to reach out to the disabled community.  I have yet to see a public realm planning application from Cork City Council that fully takes into account the impact changes will have on the disabled community.  I want Cork City Council to hire a suitable and qualified disabled person with links to the disability community in Cork, who will act as a voice at the highest level of local authority.  While public consultation has a role, we cannot expect so much from disabled people.  They have enough burdens to deal with in fighting for services, employment and supports.  They should not be expected to fight for the right to move around their own city or community.  Publishing accessibility impact studies prior to all public realm planning would create transparency and remove some of this burden.

They monitor the disabled bays and report back to traffic wardens where the disabled bays are being abused or being parked in by people without disability badges.  That is one scheme that was brought in and it was very successful.  Similarly, there is an individual in Kilkenny, Paul Crilly, who is bringing easy-read menus into our restaurants.

 the soaring cost of food, heating, fuel and housing is causing social inequality and real hardship and is pushing even more people into poverty;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  the carbon tax is the key contributing factor to Ireland's record cost-of-living increases, with transport inflation alone up over 18 per cent in the last year, motor fuels up over 22.6 per cent and home heating oil up a staggering 70 per cent;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

and <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash;  fully acknowledge that the spiraling cost-of-living crisis is now a national emergency and requires a comprehensive and robust package of measures aimed at supporting the less well off, rural residents and impacted sectors such as farming and transport operators;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  immediately act on the European Commission DIY toolbox aimed at mitigating the impact of higher energy prices, by slashing taxes and offering help to impacted households, motorists and sectors such as agriculture and road transport;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  introduce an emergency mini supplementary Budget without delay, aimed at tackling the cost-of-living crisis in a robust and meaningful way, and through a whole-of-Government approach by: <blockquote> \t&mdash;  providing for an immediate increase of &euro;20 per week to all fixed social welfare payments, in order to address the current challenges to low-cost families and shield those people on fixed incomes against the financial pain of ongoing cost increases;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  reversing the decision to increase the carbon tax in Budget 2022 and beyond, until the full impact of the energy crisis is fully understood and a cost-to-benefit analysis undertaken, by whatever parliamentary means necessary, including new legislation, if required;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; reducing the excise duty on all motor fuel by at least 50 per cent until the energy crisis abates and a proper and common-sense plan for rural public transport alternatives is put in place in every rural community, and the purchase price point of electric cars is affordable to the ordinary motorist;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  reducing the excise duty on petrol (currently 62.77 cent per litre), and diesel (currently 51.9 cent per litre), by at least 50 per cent from now until the end of 2022, which alone would save around &euro;18 on a &euro;100 fill of petrol and diesel, for the regular motorist; <br \/><br \/>&mdash;  reducing VAT on all motor fuels, electricity, and home heating oil to below 5 per cent until the end of 2022; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  providing a funding package of at least &euro;75 million to crippling farmers who are all struggling to pay for escalating input costs for fuel, animal feed and fertiliser;

 acknowledge that the pig sector requires an immediate &euro;30 million financial state-aid package to combat the explosive production cost increases and falling revenues;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  further acknowledge that the pig sector alone requires an immediate funding package of at least &euro;30 million, in order to get through the current crisis; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;  fully recognise that for people in energy poverty, assistance is needed in the present, and while retrofitting offers a long-term answer to the high bills caused by inefficient and substandard housing as well as contributing to climate action targets, it is this winter that those people need the urgent support and not in some Governmental plan in six- or seven-years' time. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group urge all Deputies to support our motion demanding that the Government hold an urgent mini-budget to mitigate and address the spiralling cost-of-living crisis on multiple fronts.  The motion seeks to have the Government recognise the cost-of-living crisis as a national emergency.  This would necessitate a comprehensive and robust package of measures intended to support less well-off and impacted sectors, via allocating financial aid and slashing consumption taxes.  The current cost-of-living crisis is financially crippling to all lower income earners, including pensioners, struggling mortgage holders and the unemployed.  It is also having a disproportionate impact on all rural residents and farmers<i>.  <\/i>The cost of electricity bills has increased from &euro;200 to &euro;500, to be paid every two months, and the Government's answer is to give people &euro;200 to cover them for the year.  That is nowhere near enough and is nothing short of an insult to people who are struggling.<\/p><p>There is a fertiliser crisis, and farmers face crippling costs for feeds, fertiliser and fuel, which has the potential to wipe out many viable farmers.  I remind the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, that 1 tonne of manure has increased in price from &euro;300 to &euro;900.  The European Union has indicated the Government can intervene but it is doing nothing, sitting on its hands, because it is a green policy to make people suffer, give them no aid whatsoever and make them stop driving and spreading fertiliser.  Where is the Government going to stop?  When is someone in Fianna F&aacute;il going to wake up and say that these are not the roots of Fianna F&aacute;il and that this is not the way the party used to work?  Fianna F&aacute;il used to work for the people, not make them suffer, but that is what it is trying to do now.  <\/p><p>On the cost of fuel, people call me and I presume every other Deputy in the House, and talk to me when they meet me in the street.  They cannot afford to put fuel in their cars but, again, this is what the Green Party, in government with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, wants.  They want to bully the people and to price fuel so high that no one can afford to travel.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, should remember that every Government Deputy will have to face the people, and they are very hungry and very anxious to meet them at the doorstep.  When they meet, they will get a fair bit of a reddening.  Many of them will get their - I will not say what - out the door and down the road.<\/p><p>Young families and pensioners are frozen in their own homes.  The latter are the people who built Ireland, and this is what the Government has done to the pensioners of Ireland.  They cannot afford to heat their homes.  Perhaps the Government is immune to us consistently repeating ourselves but that is the truth of the matter.  Many of our pensioners are slightly over the limit to receive the fuel allowance.  They cannot access it or the retrofitting scheme, perhaps because they got a couple of rolls of insulation in their attic eight or ten years ago.  I received a letter on Monday night from a constituent who is suffering from cancer.  She cannot access the fuel allowance.  She is frozen in her own home and suffering from cancer.  Do not believe for one minute that her case is a once-off; I get these letters and calls consistently.<\/p><p>Ireland is the most expensive country in the European Union for housing, with record rents, the highest mortgage interest rates in the EU and a chronic lack of supply, which caused house prices to increase by 14% in the year to November 2021.<\/p><p>The skimpy package of measures recently announced by the Government is grossly insufficient given the depth and impact of the crisis.  That is why we are tabling this motion, which is aimed at forcing an out-of-touch Government into holding a mini-budget.  For almost a year, my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I have been emphasising the need to tackle inflationary pressures, brought about predominantly by the Government&rsquo;s frenzied green policies and crippling carbon taxes.  Unfortunately, the Government has been idle, allowing costs to soar while simultaneously benefiting from record VAT, excise duties and carbon tax from fuel, home heating, electricity, household goods, building materials, fertiliser and animal feeds.  VAT, for instance, is calculated as a percentage of the price of goods or services, meaning that as those prices inflate, so too do VAT receipts for the Government.  Thus, inflation means higher prices, and more money flowing into the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Increased transport and home fuel costs are causing extreme financial hardship for many households, small businesses and farmers.  We believe, therefore, that the best way to ensure prices will fall rapidly is to reduce VAT, excise duties and carbon tax on all fuel types at least until the end of 2022.  The greatest advantage of using consumption taxes to provide relief against inflation is that the impact can be felt by the public immediately.  With the European Commission already recommending that member states take this course, the Government must finally act.  The only meaningful way to tackle current inflation and protect consumers is through taxation reliefs and increasing all fixed social welfare payments by &euro;20 per week.  The increase of &euro;5 in weekly social welfare rates in budget 2022 is grossly insufficient to keep pace with rising prices, resulting in a significant cut in living standards for those on fixed incomes.<\/p><p>In tandem with these measures, financially pressed farmers require a multi-million euro package, as called for in our motion, to mitigate a 300% jump in fertiliser costs, combined with the impacts of fuel, feed and energy spikes, which are crippling to all farmers.  The latest country-by-country scorecard from the European Commission warns that inflationary and cost-of-living pressures will persist in Ireland for 2022 and will increase faster this year here than in any other country in Europe.  In its winter 2022 outlook, the EU projects an average rate of inflation of 4.6% for Ireland this year, which is higher than the 3.5% rate it has forecast for the eurozone as a whole.  In other warnings about the soaring cost of living crisis in Ireland and inflation, many leading economists are warning prices are likely to remain high throughout 2022 and beyond, with food and fuel becoming increasingly less affordable.<\/p><p>It is time to act. We have been calling on the Government to act for the past 12 months.  Will it for once sit up and listen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300008#F00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1645610520,"counter":44,"content":"<p>My colleagues and I are very glad to be able to bring this important motion before the House.  It must be particularly upsetting for the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to have to come in here and try to defend the indefensible.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and, indeed, many Deputies on this side of the House who supported measures such as carbon taxes are now waking up because they are hearing it on the doorsteps.  They are hearing that the people are feeling the brunt of what the Government has done to them.  They are seeing exactly what the carbon taxes are going to do to them.<\/p> <p>Rural communities and Irish farmers are facing crippling costs for feed, fertiliser and fuel, which has the potential to wipe out many viable farms.  The cost of living crisis is placing crippling financial pressures on all lower income earners, whom the Government have abandoned, including pensioners, struggling mortgage holders, the unemployed, rural residents and farmers, all of whom have been feeling the deep impact of prices spiralling upwards over the past year.  There are more increases coming in May thanks to Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and all of the people who supported them.  Many of them were over on the Labour Party side, and when they woke up now and then, they told the Government that it was not doing enough and the carbon taxes should be more than they were.<\/p> <p> I welcome today's announcement because it is an acknowledgment of the crisis.  We know exactly what a pig is making today.  Farmers are losing &euro;35 per pig.  The Minister announced funding of &euro;7 million.  I am glad about that.  I was the first person to look for it when most Government Members were asleep as to what was happening in the pig sector.  The Minister knows it will not be anywhere near enough, though.  He knows that there are pig farms to which it will mean nothing.  The move could have been based on what happened in France.  My colleagues and I wanted a package worth &euro;30 million, but farmers got &euro;7 million.  It will be a drop in the ocean and will not save many pig farms.<\/p> <p> The Government has failed to make additional supports available to our other farmers despite the tremendous financial pressures they are facing.  The soaring cost of food, heating, fuel and housing is causing social inequality and significant hardship and is pushing even more people into poverty.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the other parties with it seem to be oblivious to this.  The Minister knows I am not being personal about this.  As I have said in the Chamber previously, he is a good man and a good politician, but he is here defending the indefensible.  He should be putting his hands up and saying that he knows the Government got this wrong, because it has.  The other Deputies who voted for carbon taxes need to realise that they were wrong.<\/p> <p> People will not be able to sustain this.  We are not far away from the day when we are driving along the road only to look up at a pole and see that a litre of fuel, be it diesel or petrol, costs more than &euro;2.  How are people supposed to manage then?  How are they supposed to fill their oil tanks?  The answer from the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il is that people should not fill their oil tanks and should instead go into their houses, dig up their floors, install underfloor heating and pay enormous costs for electricity even though the Government cannot ensure the supply of electricity because it has stopped people from burning turf.  In other words, the Government parties have sold their souls for an agenda that does not make sense.<\/p> <p> My good God, but there were great people in Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party long ago.  They had common sense.  The new crowd are running away with the fairies, though.  They have completely lost their grounding.  They have lost the idea that they must go to a door, knock on it and ask the person who comes out to vote for them because they will represent him or her.  What have those parties done since coming up here?  They have abandoned the people.  People are really hurting and are finding it extremely difficult to live.  Working people are even finding it too expensive to go to work because of the cost of fuel and everything else.  People cannot run their homes, but the Government's only answer is that it is worried and that it will have to place burden after burden on them until 2030 because it wants Ireland to be the goody goody boys of the world and to be the fastest reducers of carbon emissions by squeezing the life out of people through taxes.  The Government tells people that it is very good, though, because it will give them back some of those taxes to insulate their homes and that, if people have &euro;65,000 to spare under the bed, it will give them &euro;25,000.  The Government is telling people that it is taking taxes from them because it is going to give those taxes back to them.  It has lost all common sense.  Its parties might think that they can knock on doors and people will come out and say that they will back them again because Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party were great for them, but the parties will be abandoned and thrown to one side.  They are doing it to themselves.  They have not just shot themselves in the foot &ndash; they have shot the bloody legs out from under themselves with the height of their stupidity.  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p> What does the Minister believe farmers are thinking today?  If a robber had a choice between robbing a ball of money from a bank or robbing a pallet of fertiliser, the robber would be better off robbing the pallet of fertiliser because it is worth more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300008#F00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645611120,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic.  Families and workers in Kerry and all over Ireland are suffering because of the increasing cost of fuel.  Many cannot carry on and will not survive.  If diesel prices rise further, work will stop and wheels will grind to a halt.<\/p>  <p>  The Government did not recognise it two weeks ago but it needs to publish a mini-budget to deal with the problems.  The Government cannot increase the carbon tax any further.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, can manage with a bicycle here in Dublin and has several public transport options in the form of trains, buses, the DART and the Luas, but the story is totally different for someone in Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Cordal, Castleisland, Brosna or Knocknagoshel who needs to go to work in Munster Joinery or Cadbury in Rathmore, Liebherr in Killarney or Walsh Colour Print.  That person needs a car &ndash; there is no other option.  He or she has to travel several miles to go to work.  Parents who have to take their children to school need cars.  They have no other choice.  When people live in outlying places like Glencar, Killorglin, Cahersiveen and Kilgarvan, they cannot put two or three children up on the bar of a bike together and bring them to school.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government are content to let the people of rural Ireland suffer all of these extra living costs in order to keep the Green Party on side.  Indeed, when we were making our case at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to Mr. Fabien Santini from the EU about the savage increase in fertiliser costs, a Green Party Deputy said that he was happy because it would help farmers to go organic and spread less fertiliser.  Being city based, he believes that saying this will not hurt him electorally, but if the cost of food production increases, the cost to the consumer increases as well.  How do Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael backbenchers content themselves with utterances like that?<\/p>  <p>  Farmers are terrified and many do not know how or if they will be able to continue.  The cost of agri-diesel has increased from 38 cent to more than &euro;1 since this time last year.  Feed costs have doubled and fertiliser costs have trebled.  Urea fertiliser cost &euro;330 per tonne last July.  It now costs &euro;940 and is difficult to get.  When we pressed the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on the cost of fertiliser, she told us that the Government had written a letter to someone.  God almighty, but is that all it can do?  What about dropping the anti-dumping tariff of &euro;50?  Would the Government ever consider giving farmers a subsidy of &euro;100 per tonne towards the savage cost of fertiliser?  This would help to keep the cost of food down for housewives.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial lorry owners in the transport industry are at breaking point.  They were outside the gates of Leinster House months ago and made their case in an ordinary and respectful manner.  I asked the Taoiseach to forgo the extra VAT and excise duties that the Government was accruing from the increased fuel costs and give the sector a chance but he did not respond and the Government has done nothing.  That was three or four months ago.  The Government took in an extra &euro;3 billion in VAT returns in 2021 compared with 2020.  That was &euro;1 billion more than its own projections.  God almighty, but would it give some bit of that money back to people to let them continue operating?  Truck owners face several other cost increases for tyres, batteries, AdBlue and many other wearing components.  Their prices have doubled.  To top it all, truck owners cannot get parts owing to a fierce delay because of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  It is a scandal in God's eyes that people on illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit, maternity benefit, disabled benefit, enhanced illness benefit or occupational injuries benefit do not qualify for the fuel allowance.  A pensioner living with a cancer patient who is in receipt of illness benefit will not qualify for the fuel allowance.  Even though that person has paid the contributions entitling him or her to get the benefit, he or she cannot get the fuel allowance.<\/p> <p>I have raised this before and the Government has done nothing about it.  These are vulnerable people, many of whom are sick and in a bad way.  The Government is talking about what it has done.  It has done nothing for these classes of people.  Gas prices went up by 10% again yesterday and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made a submission against Shannon LNG, where we would perhaps have a hope of getting gas in from America, which wants to sell it to us, because soon we will not be able to get it from the Russians.<\/p> <p> Elderly people need heat in their homes to survive more so than younger people.  They will perish in their homes if the Government does not act to help them.  This mini-budget should reverse the decision to increase the carbon tax in budget 2022 and beyond until the full impact of the energy crisis is fully understood and a cost-benefit analysis is undertaken by whatever parliamentary means necessary, including new legislation if required.<\/p> <p> The mini-budget must reduce the excise duty on all motor fuel by at least 50% until the energy crisis abates, a proper and common-sense plan for rural public transport alternatives is put in place in every rural community and the purchase price point of electric cars is affordable to the ordinary motorist.  The Government should not be trying to force people away from diesel or petrol cars until it has a reasonable and practical alternative, which the electric car is not at present.  It must give over its codding.  It knows it is wrong in that regard.  People will adapt and change if it is practical.<\/p> <p> The mini-budget must reduce the excise duty on petrol, which is currently 62.77 cent per litre, and on diesel, which is 51.9 cent per litre, by at least 50% from now until the end of 2022.  This alone would save approximately &euro;18 on a &euro;100 fill of petrol or diesel for the regular motorist.  The mini-budget must reduce VAT on all motor fuels, electricity and home heating oil to below 5% until the end of 2022.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister to do this.  Otherwise, people cannot go on; they cannot continue indefinitely.  As has been said in this Chamber, the price will shortly be more than &euro;2 per litre.  The Government will have to do something.  It is not fair to continue insisting on a carbon tax just to please the Green Party and keep it onside.  Government Deputies should think of the people who elected them in rural Ireland and the people who always voted for them.  Those people are changing their minds and nothing will stop them from doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300009#G00200","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645611720,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in October 2021, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine tasked Teagasc to lay out a credible roadmap to assist farmers in the short-term with the rise in fertiliser prices as well as offering a long-term solution in the move to reduce dependency on chemical fertiliser;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

in January 2022, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine met with the main banks to discuss the current challenges in the pig sector and the importance of their ongoing support, with the key message that farmers experiencing cash flow difficulties should engage with the banks as soon as possible to discuss options and that the banks remain committed to supporting their customers in the period ahead;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

Bord Bia has intensified its efforts to promote quality assured Irish pig meat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated TV, radio and national print media advertising campaigns planned for Q1 2022, and also has two EU programmes that have significant funding allocated towards pig meat promotional activity currently running in China, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Teagasc has intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore financial options potentially available to them and to assist in discussions with financial institutions;

this has led to a significant increase in the general Government debt of around 11 per cent of national income; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland's public debt is almost a quarter of a trillion euros as a result, and among the highest in the developed world on a per capita basis.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and Government colleagues, I thank the Deputies for bringing forward the motion.  As they will be aware, the Irish agrifood sector is our largest indigenous industry and of enormous importance right across the country and in rural Ireland in particular.  It is a sector that touches off every rural parish in the country and supports a balanced regional economy that drives &euro;13.5 billion in exports.  It is truly an exceptional sector with excellent farmers, food producers and processors at its core.  Whether it is through the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or direct Exchequer supports, this Government stands full square behind our farm families and food producers.  That has been our form and track record at all times since this Government came to office.  Despite many of the markets for Irish produce remaining relatively strong over the past 12 months, bringing solid returns to farmers, input costs have increased for all farmers, be that for feed, fertiliser or fuel.  In some cases, the increase in output prices has been eroding market returns and that is clear.<\/p><p>Specifically, the pig sector has been at the centre of the challenges of these input price challenges while also suffering a considerable dip in the market.  Coming as it did from a base of &euro;330 million export value in 2010, the pig sector has shown exceptional growth over the last decade.  It is the third largest of our livestock sectors now after dairy and beef, accounting for 6.3% of our output value or more than &euro;930 million in 2021 in exports, supporting approximately 8,000 jobs.  As well as this valuable contribution to our national economy, it is also a key contributor to our rural economy and communities.  As we know, Irish pig farmers are currently facing exceptional challenges due to a combination of extremely low prices and extraordinarily high input costs.  Mirroring the situation that has been presented across the EU over recent months, Irish pig farmers have seen their margins decimated.  I know this is an issue on which Deputies have focused very significantly in their Private Members' motion today.<\/p><p>As Deputies will know, the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I have engaged at length with the stakeholders in this sector and through the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, national pig committee, very much in understanding and working with them knowing the challenges they are under at the moment.  While input costs present an issue for all sectors and will continue to do so during 2022, the pig sector has been particularly impacted.  Production is very dependent on the use of compound feeds and it is thus more exposed than other sectors to fluctuations in feed prices.  For the sector, this price cost squeeze is being felt acutely already and the sector has not shared the positive prices context of other sectors over the course of the last few months.  Rather, it is caught now in a low point in the price cycle with global market disturbance and worsening price cost squeeze.<\/p><p>With many farmers reporting that credit lines extended to them for feed are being curtailed, the cash reserves built up over the better 2019-20 period will deplete accordingly.  I know feed mills are working with their customers but they are also under pressure.  Feed prices have risen consistently since the beginning of 2020.  The world consumed more grain in the last year than it produced and world grain demand is growing at a rate of 1.8% annually.  These factors influencing the increase are twofold both in global demand and increased input costs.  Along with other agriculture ministers, I have called for an integrated EU-wide approach and for the European Commission to deploy appropriate solutions to both the concerns around input cost and current severe market disturbance in the pig sector.  I continue to raise these issues at EU level.  Like ministers in many other states, I have needed to assess what national support we could put in place within our own capacity.  I raised this matter again with colleagues and with the Commissioner as recently as Monday at the European Council meeting.<\/p><p>A series of measures have been brought forward to support the Irish pig sector, including intensification of promotion activity by Bord Bia and advisory support from Teagasc.  There is also financial support, which is important here as well, through the Brexit impact loan scheme and Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, both of which are financed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and can be used for working capital.  They are important supports at the moment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I also recently met with the main banks and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, specifically to discuss the crisis.  The banks have outlined their continued commitment to supporting their customers and I know farmers are engaging with them.<\/p><p>Importantly, in terms of taking action at national level, I was pleased yesterday to announce a support scheme with a fund of &euro;7 million, which will allow for partial compensation payments in the region of &euro;20,000 to pig farmers.  I delivered this package following thorough engagement with the IFA and its national pig committee.  I am grateful for the support of my Cabinet colleagues in approving this support package yesterday.  It is an emergency response as an urgent short-term solution to assist producers that will be viable for the current extreme market circumstances.  I believe it is the biggest package there has been for the sector at any stage over the country's history and is a reflection of the challenge the sector is under at the moment.  It is also at the maximum level of &euro;20,000 that can be awarded to any one farm under the state aid <i>de minimis<\/i>rules.  That is the mechanism we are using to introduce this scheme to ensure it can be brought to farmers as quickly as possible at a time when they are under immense pressure.  I believe this support scheme reflects the challenge farmers are under.  I assure Deputies that my Department and the agencies will continue to do all they can to support pig farmers through the difficult period ahead.<\/p><p>As we are all aware, farmers are facing increased fertiliser prices due to factors outside of their control.  In a broader sense, energy prices remain well above 2021 levels and increased global demand continues, particularly from the big grain-producing nations.  Increased transport costs and EU-imposed tariffs and duties on certain third-country imports also add to these prices.  Again, it is an issue I have raised consistently at European Council level.<\/p> <p>The spike in prices will have an impact on farm margins in 2022, but farmers led by advice from my Department and from Teagasc are taking steps to reduce use and mitigate where possible the worst effects of the increases.  Last year, I tasked Teagasc with laying out a credible roadmap to help farmers reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the short and medium term.  Last month, I launched the 2022 soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign at Teagasc Ballyhaise College in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This roadmap can be good for the environment but, particularly important, it will be good for the pocket at the moment.  We all know that there is undoubtedly much more that we can get out of the effective use of organic fertiliser in terms of how it is applied, when it is applied and in maximising its capacity to reduce costs and to grow grass.<\/p> <p> I have also written to the European Commissioner, examining the effect of the European market of removing anti-dumping measures.  A decision is expected shortly on this.  Notwithstanding all of this, I am acutely aware of the challenges that many farmers will face this year.  We are working hard to offset these increases.  As Deputies will know, since I was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have sought to use the Exchequer funding in the most effective way possible to support our farmers.  Working with Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, we delivered an 11% increase in the Department&rsquo;s budget for last year, which was followed up by a 2% increase on top of that for this year.  This funding is being used to support farmers to underpin incomes through the continuation of key schemes, including the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the beef data and genomics programme, as well as creating new measures, such as the straw incorporation scheme, which can deliver for example &euro;10,000 to a 100 acre tillage farm.<\/p> <p> We are also seeking new and innovative ways of protecting farm incomes and ensuring their long-term viability for the sector.  As the Deputies will know, in the past, often between CAP programmes, there have been gaps in schemes where they did not exist.  That did not happen this time because the Government has made a massive commitment to ensure that we support farm incomes and that we support farmers.  We have continued all of those schemes. <\/p> <p> On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, I thank the Deputies for bringing forward the motion today.  As they can see, we are taking a whole-of-government approach in supporting farmers and farm families.  Our farm families, our rural communities and our food producers are the backbone of this world-class sector.  We are taking every step to support them at this challenging time.  Through the incoming CAP strategic plan, which will run from next year until 2027, I secured an extra &euro;1 billion for various farm scheme supports.  That is a 50% increase on the previous CAP programme.  Again, it is unprecedented in the history of CAP in this country that we could deliver a 50% increase in funding from one CAP period to the next.  The figure is a full &euro;1 billion.  It is a reflection of how this Government, by being in office, by being in government, by delivering, by working hard day-to-day and by not necessarily talking on the sidelines, but by getting in, rolling up its sleeves, putting farm families at the centre of what it does, is delivering for them every week, every month and every year while it is in office.  That is what we are doing.  That 50% increase of &euro;1 billion will enable us to do that by improving many of those schemes next year.  For example, the new flagship agri-environment scheme will see up to a maximum payment of &euro;10,500 to farmers taking part in the co-operative measures.  This is real money to real farm families.  We are making a real difference to them by being in government, by working hard for them day-by-day and by delivering.<\/p> <p> We are, therefore, taking an approach to address short-term challenges now, while laying foundations to ensure the long-term viability and success of our agrifood sector, as well as the viability, success and profitability of our farm families.  This Government is doing everything in its power to back  families and our farmers and it will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300010#H00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645612320,"counter":50,"content":"<p>For the record, of every &euro;17 in fuel, the Government takes &euro;10 in tax.

That is how we can help the people in Ireland today, by putting money directly into their pocket.  That would help everyone, no matter if they were a farmer, unemployed, working or an old age pensioner.  It would help everyone in this country if the Government did that.<\/p>  <p>  According to figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, 700,000 houses depend on oil heating.  The Government talks about a retrofit.  Limerick County Council has said that it is retrofitting 60 social houses in the autumn of this year.  However, there are 700,000 houses that depend on oil in this country.  What does the Government do?  It comes up with a retrofit programme, but the people must have money in their accounts.  People do not have the extra money to do the retrofitting.  They can barely survive and put food on the table.  Why can the Government not understand that?  It was elected to help the people in the here and now.  The Government is destroying families.  The next generation coming up cannot even get to colleges, because of the cost of fuel and there is no public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is in a bubble and it needs to get out of it.  It seems when that they come up to Dublin they think on a completely different wavelength.  The wavelength they will get when they go to Limerick city and county, as well as elsewhere in the country, is that people will remember the Government.  They will say that for every &euro;17 they put into their car, the Government takes &euro;10 back from them.  That does not include what they have taken from adults clothes and the price of milk, butter and bread.  All the basics, which we need to live, are taxed.  The Government comes out and says it is giving &euro;20,000 and &euro;1 million there.  It should do the right thing and reduce VAT and put it back into everyone&rsquo;s pockets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300011#J00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1645612320,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Minister made several references to what has been done for farming families but I would like to point out that while some measures are welcome, there are serious difficulties.  The carbon tax is crippling every sector, including farmers.  He has left that one out.  Agri-contractors cannot survive, given the level of tax being imposed on them.  This, of course, is being passed on to farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme has been an absolute disaster.  I would ask for that to be revised and improved.  The Minister mentioned the budget in October, the forthcoming budget, and so forth.  However, people cannot wait until October.  People are really struggling.  Every day I get calls to my office from elderly people, from working families, from businesses, from farmers and from hauliers across Laois and Offaly.  The Minister is doing nothing for those people.  Those people are struggling while Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il continue to support the Green Party in its vanity project.  That is what it is.<\/p> <p>The Government is punishing the citizens who voted for it.  That is what is happening.  It is a matter for the Government whether it wants to realise that but it is the harsh reality.  People in rural Ireland do not have the luxury of transport outside their door every morning so they have to fill their cars with petrol or diesel to get to work.  These are the people who are being punished.  I constantly find myself, as a rural Deputy in Laois-Offaly, standing up here trying to protect the jobs that we have.  I should be speaking about job creation but we have a disaster at the moment because of the just transition and what the Government has done.  Again, with its green ideology, it has thrown the midlands under the green bus.  It needs to see the chaos it is causing.  This just transition is on top of the struggles people already have with the price hikes in electricity and heating.<\/p> <p> With the just transition, or unjust transition, there have been job losses.  Now jobs are under pressure in forestry and also in haulage.  The hauliers are under a lot of pressure.  I do not know what exactly is happening in forestry but I would be very grateful if the Minister could try to sort out the mess.  Horticulture is an absolute disaster.  The Green Party Minister of State ignored recommendations from a working group.  That is absolutely outrageous.  The Minister can paint this any way he likes but the harsh reality is that tens of thousands of jobs are at stake.<\/p> <p> The Government is punishing people unnecessarily, particularly with the carbon tax.  The Rural Independent Group, of which Deputy Mattie McGrath is the leader, is the only group which has been consistent on the carbon tax.  In fact, we were the only political group to oppose the carbon tax from day one.  People need to know that and should not be fooled by what is happening in here.  This House is an echo chamber at times.  The Minister needs to listen to the voice of the people.  People cannot continue like this.  The facts are there.  I am sure the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has been in touch with the Government.  It has had an unprecedented number of calls to its service this year.  I have seen applications for the fuel allowance refused.  People who should be entitled to the allowance are not entitled to it because the Government has not gone far enough.  Other countries have brought in measures to help people.  I stress again that people cannot wait until October.<\/p> <p> Given the terrible negative impact of the carbon tax on agriculture, I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to try to sort out this mess because it is crippling agri-contractors and farming families.  It appears as though the Green Party wants to force farmers off the land altogether.  If the Minister is part and parcel of that, he is not standing up for farmers but punishing them.  People in general are being punished.  We have seen a very blunt transition that is not fair.  There are no alternative jobs.  People are struggling to heat their homes and pay for basics.<\/p> <p> I would appreciate it if the Minister would do me the courtesy of listening to the message I have from my constituents in Laois-Offaly.  I refuse to continue until the Minister shows me the courtesy of giving me his attention for the few minutes I have left.  I have always been reasonable.  I was interrupted and disrupted.

It is important to recognise that there is an extra burden on many rural families, in particular farming families.  Of course, whether you live in a urban or a rural area, you are faced with the challenges of high rents, high childcare costs, high insurance costs and high mortgage rates - all the areas we have been discussing - but there has been a particular issue with regard to increases in the cost of energy, especially motor fuel, that place an additional burden on farming families and that is quite clearly evident in the price of fertiliser, which has already been discussed.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, there is a problem that was exposed in the remarks of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, who, I regret, is not here.  He still maintains that the CAP budget and funding for farm supports has increased when it quite clearly has decreased as a result of the poor negotiation that the Government engaged in with respect to the European Union budget.  There will be fewer supports for farm families over the round of the next Common Agricultural Policy than there was in the previous one.  That is a statement of fact and yet the Minister continues to sell as spin that that is not the case.  It is a three-card trick because the Government also claims, as it did in last night's debate, that &euro;1.5 billion of carbon tax funds are ring-fenced to go to farmers in agri-environment schemes when that &euro;1.5 billion, if it materialises, is only plugging some of the hole that is evident in the Common Agricultural Policy as a result of the same bad negotiations at EU budget level.  Nobody can argue with what are statements of fact, in that over the next five years farming families will be paying more in carbon tax and getting less in farm supports while being asked to do more in relation to their environmental obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Farm families were, as all of us were, eagerly waiting to see what big measures would be introduced in the Government's cost of living package.  Can the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, imagine being from a farm family at the top end of north Monaghan and waiting in anticipation to see what supports the Government would introduce in its cost of living package only to find out that Luas tickets will be 20% cheaper?  That is welcome for those who have access to public transport but the fact that it was incorporated into a cost of living crisis that is most acutely felt by rural communities shows how out of touch the Government is in respect of the services that are in place.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the measures announced last night involving a &euro;7 million package for pig farmers, although I agree with previous speakers that it will not go far enough.  Two weeks ago I raised this in a Topical Issues debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We had what I thought was a constructive debate.  We outlined the need for a financial package.  We also outlined the need for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and banks to step up to the plate in support of pig farmers and of other vulnerable farmers.  The Minister indicated that he had met them and was expecting some improvement but no improvement has come.<\/p>  <p>  I also outlined the difficulties in terms of staff shortages at processing plants that still have not been resolved.  Even though the Government stated that it has put in place the measures to address those staff shortages through permits, they still have not been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  We need to go beyond the rhetoric to the delivery of supports.  If we want to support those workers, families and communities that are struggling to make ends meet, the answers are simple.  The answers have been outlined quite clearly by Sinn F&eacute;in.  We need a cost of living cash payment for those who need it most.  We need to see a support for renters.  They need one month's rent back in their pocket and they need to see a rent freeze for at least three years.  We need to increase the minimum wage.  We need to increase all working-age social welfare payments.  We need to extend the fuel allowance by at least two weeks and we need to ensure that we cut the cost of childcare services by one third.  We need to scrap the proposed increase in carbon tax.<\/p>  <p>  The disgraceful actions of Russia in Ukraine will likely lead to EU sanctions of some sort.  If those sanctions impact negatively on Irish workers, families and farmers, the EU needs to bring forward a package.  I would ask the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to make that point at European Council level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300013#L00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1645613520,"counter":89,"content":"<p>\"Only today, I had to decide whether to tax my car - we live in rural Ireland and there is no public transport - or heat my house.  Either way, food shopping will be slim this week.\"  That is from a letter I received from a rural Tipperary constituent last week, one of the many people for whom a reduction in public transport fees will do absolutely nothing.  People must tax their car, get their NCT done and pay soaring fuel costs and a &euro;200 contribution to the electricity bill is a fleeting benefit.  That is how out of touch the Government is when it comes to responding to the real needs of people out there, particularly those in rural Ireland and the young people who have ambitions for the future.  Instead, the Government wants to give them easier access to unavailable public transport and saddle them with further debts so that they can make their homes efficient.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a cost of living payment which would immediately put money into the pockets of hard-pressed working families.  Only yesterday evening, we called for the pending increase in the carbon tax in May to be scrapped.  We suggested a range of measures that would make a real difference to people's lives.  For example, in the farming community - the lifeblood of rural Ireland which Government representatives wants to see working their farms part time - the pig sector has been badly affected by Brexit.  The ability to source alternative markets has been affected because of the rising transport costs.  Input costs have soared while energy costs are having a real impact.  The capacity of processing plants is at crisis point due to staff shortages and factory prices are falling.  Since September, we have been highlighting, both North and South, that a lack of capacity within the food processing sector will result in financial hardship for farmers.  The Minister should consider directing the SBCI to provide flexibility to farmers seeking to avail of Department-funded agriculture loans.  The Minister met with banks but farmers have reported no change in the availability of credit.  The Brexit adjustment reserve should also be used to provide direct aid to pig farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Elsewhere in the farming sector, the Government's slow pace has continued with the delays in the promised establishment of the national food ombudsman or meat regulator.  Farmers are also facing increasing fertiliser bills on top of everything else.  That is why we have been calling on the Government to advocate at a European level for the suspension of anti-dumping tariffs on fertiliser.<\/p>  <p>  These are only some of the measures that we have proposed along with our alternative budget that was designed with rural Ireland and the agricultural sector firmly in mind.  The Government has to understand that when it fails our farms, it fails our rural communities and by a consistent reluctance to take action, it has added to the pressures that our rural communities are facing.  It seems like rural Ireland is seen by the Government as an important generator of revenue but not good enough to pay back in kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300013#L00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1645613520,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on this motion.  The issues in rural Ireland are across all of our society but are particularly acute where people live in isolated areas and where they do not have the options they may have in other places.  I note that when the Government brought in the relief for people in the form of the cost of living package, it talked a great deal about putting in place a measure to reduce the cost of public transport by 20%.  That will make very little difference to people living in much of rural Ireland, particularly in places in the north west.  When you go north of Sligo-Leitrim, there is not even a train.  We needed to see focused measures.  That is what always seems to be missing.  This across-the-board approach where everybody will get the same amount of money shows a failure to understand the root cause of the problem.  What we need to do is ensure that we target the measures to the people who need them most.<\/p>  <p>  Across rural Ireland, many people are in real difficulty, particularly if they have to travel to work.  They have the soaring cost of fuel and of heating oil, in particular, because that is the only option people in rural Ireland have to heat their home in many cases.  Measures were introduced to retrofit homes in the past couple of days.  In rural areas, it will be much more difficult to come up with solutions to all of that.<\/p>  <p>  The issue we need to bring to the fore here is that we need to target the money to the people who need it most.  Those are mainly working families - people who get up early in the morning and work hard trying to make ends meet to pay their mortgage, to pay their loans and to get a sense of future.  That is what has been taken away from them.  The Government needs to recognise that it needs to put money in place for all of the people, but particularly those who are most acutely affected and those in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300013#L00400","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1645614120,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil muid i ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im i leith costais maireacht&aacute;la.

It was interesting that the &euro;505 million that was announced was lumped in with the budget.  We have raised the cost of living for a number of months, particularly after the survey we conducted last October to which more than 14,000 people responded.  At that stage, it was clear that the cost of living was becoming more of an issue and it has only gotten worse.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the issue of the cost of living we hear a lot about the increases in social welfare and the fuel allowance and you would think the Government was doing people a favour.  We know that at the moment every single working age social protection payment is below the poverty line.  We also know the fuel allowance has still not been restored to 32 weeks since it was cut by a previous Government.  For the vast majority of workers out there, aside from the electricity credit that was announced, they will see no assistance whatsoever going forward with their heating bills and that is a problem.  It is now more than a year since we brought forward a motion seeking for a discretionary fund to be established.  I was told it was on the table but it did not come to pass and people are repeatedly being told to seek an urgent needs payment.  However, people who work more than 30 hours per week cannot get that, so there are no supports out there for people who will struggle with their heating.  Not only had we supported a mini-budget but we brought forward one three weeks ago and we asked that the Minister would look at that surplus &euro;1.1 billion in VAT receipts above target that was taken in last year.  We asked for that to be used to put money back in people&rsquo;s pockets and support them.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad we are looking at the increased costs on farmers and I see them at home.  These increases are crippling, from feed to fertiliser.  We know that rural communities depend on farmers and farm families and they are struggling.  We already had a crisis and many farms are not viable to begin with.  They are now seeing increased costs which are making the situation far worse.  I commend the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward this motion and I hope the Government will seek to act because this situation will get worse.  What has been announced is not enough.

We know that the cost of fertiliser has increased by between 160% and 228% in the last year and that is completely unsustainable.  While beef prices might be high, the outputs are crazy.  Feed costs have gone through the roof and farm families are struggling with fuel costs and other costs associated with living in rural Ireland.  I do not know how many more times we can tell the Government to scrap the planned carbon taxes, which do not make sense economically.  The Government is digging its heels in on this and it will suffer the damage for that.  It makes no economic sense because we do not have alternatives to carbon.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny brought forward legislation to rural-proof Government policy and it is obvious that this is not happening.  People in rural Ireland and farming communities know this; it is not just us saying that.  As late as last week, the CSO data showed that regional inequality continues to rise.  The rising inequality in disposable income, for instance, was &euro;3,237 in 2020, as opposed to &euro;1,307 in 2000.  That is nothing political but it should tell the Minister what is happening and what this Government and other Governments have done in rural Ireland.  Inequality in disposable income is three times higher than it was a decade ago so something is absolutely wrong.  That is why we need a Government policy with positive discrimination towards rural Ireland.  People feel that in their pockets more than anywhere else.  I know it relates to higher education, regional infrastructure and everything else but it also relates to disposable income.  Where we have farmers who have so little disposable income by the time they have paid for everything, it completely discriminates against rural Ireland and if Covid showed us one thing it was the need to address regional inequality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300014#M00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1645614120,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The rapid increase in the cost of basic necessities of everyday life, including rent, light, heat, fuel, health, childcare and groceries is having a profound and negative impact on workers and families the length and breadth of this country.  That is particularly true in rural areas and constituencies like my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Maintaining a basic standard of living is beyond the reach of some and it is a real and growing challenge for far too many people.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has refused to listen to us in Sinn F&eacute;in, to others on this side of the House and to the likes of St. Vincent de Paul and that growing list of others highlighting the impact of the soaring cost of living.  I want to go back to the latest report of Barnardos which states that one quarter of families fear they will not be able to feed their children because it is getting harder to put food on the table.  Some 19% of respondents said they had skipped meals so they could feed their families and children.  More must be done now.  The Government has admitted that its &euro;500 million cost of living package will not be enough for many families.  It has acknowledged its failings and yet it continues to fail to act.  Targeted measures are needed.  For months Sinn F&eacute;in has been warning the Government about the cost of living and it has shown the Government how it can be done.  I heard the Minister on the radio this morning saying that he appreciates the difficulties but he must also then appreciate how ludicrous it is to tell people who are in these desperate situations that they must wait until October.  While the Government continues to bury its head in the sand, hardworking people are struggling daily and making the choice whether their families should be cold or hungry.  That is bordering on Dickensian.<\/p>  <p>  I have read the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion put forward by our colleagues and it speaks about a proactive response.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister should shake his head.  I refer to the public debt of one quarter of a trillion euro.  The Minister should not try to put that on the shoulders of average working families the length and breadth of this country.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, spoke about delivering but the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, should look out the door.  All that the Government is delivering is hardship, poverty and increased personal debt and rural Ireland is paying the price for something it had no hand, act or part in creating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300014#M00400","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1645614720,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I know the Minister runs a constituency office.  If it is anything like my advice clinics or those of Sinn F&eacute;in or the Rural Independent Group, which has tabled this motion, it ought to busy with people who are presenting household bills and the choices they have to make daily or weekly on whether to heat their homes or feed their families.  These are not fabricated concerns on this side of House but the very real concerns of real people in communities throughout the country.  There is a lot in this motion and much to be commended in it.  Deputy McGrath wanted to have a debate purely on the pig farming industry for which time has not been allocated, but it was included in this motion.  It shines a light on an industry that is struggling.  I am sure Deputy McGrath would have preferred a distinct section of D&aacute;il business was dedicated to it, but it is included in this motion, probably rightfully so.<\/p>  <p>  The cost-of-living crisis is widespread and cutting through every single community in every county in our country.  The Labour Party, like Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats and now the Rural Independent Group, have all brought motions over recent weeks to bring solutions to the Minister to try to tackle this issue.  We support the call for a mini-budget, which has been on record for a couple of weeks.  A whole-of-government approach is required to tackle the soaring cost of living.  The cost of living is one way of putting it.  Another way is that it is making the poor poorer.  That is the reality of the cost-of-living crisis.  For those who can barely afford to get by when things are relatively benign, when things take a turn as they have now, due to many factors that, in fairness, are outside the control of our State but are impacting on people throughout the country, it is the poor who suffer the most.<\/p>  <p>  We have put forward proposals that we ask the Minister to re-examine.  We need to look at an immediate rent freeze and a roadmap to reduce Irish mortgage interest rates to the EU average.  It is a scandal that they remain so high.  We need to provide emergency energy cost-relief packages for households, which should include a temporary time-limited reduction in the VAT rate on energy and fuel up until the next budget, and seek an EU derogation to allow for long-term retention of the historic 13.5% rate on electricity and gas, when such a temporary VAT cut expires.  Considering everything we have done to bend over backwards for the EU over the past decade and more, we can and should apply for a derogation on this.  There is no reason we should not.  We should introduce additional targeted supports for those in energy poverty by widening access to the fuel allowance and commit to the introduction of a refundable carbon tax credit for low-income households to support the long-term phasing out of fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  I will pause on that point and the point about the carbon tax.  I am deeply troubled and concerned about how the carbon tax is being discussed overall in the discourse.  There are many reasons the cost of living is rising.  Many taxes are contributing to that, in addition to other reasons apart from taxation.  This motion details excise duty on petrol and diesel, for example, and we have spoken about VAT.  There has been an effort by some, however, which we saw from Sinn F&eacute;in during last night's debate, to toxify the carbon tax to the point where it becomes so deeply unpopular that it will be included in election manifestos going into the next election and will ultimately be cut or wiped out altogether.  There is no doubt carbon tax is difficult for many, especially those on low incomes or no incomes, but there are ways we can target supports for those families without having to row back on carbon tax.  Carbon tax is not the only method for tackling climate action, but it is an important one.  Anyone who is serious about climate knows it is one of the important measures.  This effort has not just been going on over the past couple of weeks or during the debate on last night's motion, and it is not just a big element of this motion.  I have seen it when I have been on the doors over recent months.  Targeted messaging is going on through social media campaigns to try to turn the carbon tax into the new water charges and into a tax so deeply unpopular and politically toxic that it has to be defeated and rowed back on.<\/p>  <p>  We need to retrofit homes.  The energy consumption by housing in our country accounts for just under a third of all energy emissions.  It has to be targeted and it has to be funded.  It is difficult and it will be a long process.  There is a degree of ambition in the package announced last week, but we need to see it work and we need to see it go quickly to homes that need it the most.  There is an awful lot attached to it.  We need to see apprentices and experts in these retrofitting areas in the trades be available for this work.  There is an awful lot to it.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply troubled because climate cannot wait.  It cannot.  We are seeing it in the three back-to-back storms of the past week.  There are articles about how the jet streams in the Atlantic are changing due to climate change.  These are the reasons these weather events are happening.  The science is indisputable.  Where the rubber meets the road on it is in areas such as this.  That is what disappointing because there are so many different ways we can help people in difficulty due to the cost-of-living crisis.  We can help people through direct targeting of supports and payments to get through this and to be able to phase out fossil fuels in their lives.  There seems to be a sledgehammer approach to this, which unfortunately will crack the mature debate we need to have about climate.  It does it a disservice and it takes away from the real measures, some of which are in this motion and other motions, and many of which are in the motions we tabled two weeks ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300015#N00100","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1645614720,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this very important motion.  It covers a number of important issues relating to the cost of living and rising energy costs, in addition to some very important issues affecting farmers, in particular, such as rising costs, which need a lot of attention.  This motion correctly outlines this as an issue that affects people in rural and urban areas.  It affects people on low incomes throughout different parts of Ireland.  It is very important that it gets a good airing.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a situation at present where people are hurting from the cost-of-living increases, such as those in energy.  I talked to a constituent recently, who was typical of what many people are saying.  He told me that, every week, when he gets his income, the very first thing he does is buy groceries so that his family will be able to eat for the week.  He then makes decisions about what bills to pay, but the one thing he is committed to doing is that weekly shop so that his family can eat.  He then makes very tough decisions on what bills for necessities he has to pay and what ones he cannot.  That is the situation people are in at present.<\/p>  <p>  If we are serious about tackling climate change, and we have to be, we have to recognise two things.  We have to recognise tackling climate change cannot wait and people trying to put food on their table to feed their families also cannot wait.  Those two things are equally important.  What we now see happening in this debate and in recent discourse - we have to question whether it suits certain political actors - is a division around this and a prioritisation of one over the other.  It is becoming divisive.  It reminds me of a book by Ed Moloney I have just finished, which is a very comprehensive book about many issues that happened in the North.  He makes the argument in it that it suited some of the political actors in the North to have a divisive debate.  It created political division and it moved voters towards the extremes.<\/p>  <p>  If we do not want to see that happening in respect of climate change here, it is essential that just transition, which means no one is left behind, is embedded into everything the Government does.  I will give a couple of examples of where the Government is not doing that when it comes to meeting the current cost-of-living crisis.  For example, in considering the retrofitting grants the Government has brought in, we know that some households simply cannot afford to contribute some of the cost of retrofitting to avail of grants.  They need those 100% grants.<\/p> <p>What is the Government doing on those 100% grants?  There are 177 homes per month, at present, and the Government will increase that to 400 homes per month.  Some 300,000 households in Ireland are at risk of fuel poverty, according to the ESRI.  When the Government increases the 100% grants to 400 homes per month, it will take 61 years to retrofit those 300,000 households at risk of fuel poverty.  That leaves people behind.  It does not show a commitment to inclusion or just transition in terms of climate change.  Climate change cannot wait.  We must bring people with us, which means we must ensure people on the lowest incomes and those who are struggling to pay bills are not left behind.<\/p> <p> An especially vulnerable group in terms of housing issues and cost of living is renters.  What did the Government say when concerns were raised that the retrofitting schemes may lead to some renters being evicted if a landlord wants to renovate and retrofit?  We were told landlords would be monitored.  That is not a huge amount of use to renters who are worried about being evicted.  How is the monitoring of landlords going?  The Government, this year, decided in the budget Estimates the Minister brought forward to have a 20% decrease in funding for rental inspections.  That is how seriously it takes the idea of inspecting rental accommodation and monitoring landlords.  What is more, in the past couple of years, real-world inspections where an inspector goes into a rental property, have been replaced, admittedly, perhaps due to Covid, by so-called virtual inspections.  However, those virtual inspections are not even inspections.  It is a self-assessment form with some photos that is submitted by a landlord.  The Government is not taking this seriously in terms of supporting people who are more vulnerable.<\/p> <p> What we need now, to support people on lower incomes and those are working, is a living wage in order that people can afford to meet the basics.  We need to have a ban on rent increases.  We have seen today news coverage that the profits of Ireland's largest landlord are up yet again.  We know the Government is not taxing the profits of those institutional landlords.  It is, of course, taxing smaller landlords.<\/p> <p> Some 75% of the Government's measures of cost of living were universal and were not targeted.  We saw three times the amount of money go to owners of second and holiday homes as went to increasing supports for working families on low incomes, for example, the working family payment.  The priorities are all wrong and were not targeted enough.<\/p> <p> Those measures can only so far.  What has to happen is that the root causes in terms of cost of living have to be tackled.  It is clear the Government could do that on the rental side if it wanted to.  It could do that on the accommodation side.  It could, straight away, introduce a tax on vacancy.  It has been talking about it for years.  Where is it?  If the Government brought in a tax on vacancy, we would get more homes into supply and that would have a somewhat stabilising effect in terms of affordability, especially as a tax on vacancy would mean homes that need to be done up and renovated could come in at lower prices and give people some options.  The measures the Government has taken so far, which are largely not targeted and do not address the root causes, do not go anywhere near enough to meet people's needs.<\/p> <p> Rural communities are affected by this, as well, and we have to get real about things such as public transport in rural areas.  Yes, there has been increased funding in recent years.  It is important to acknowledge there have been some useful schemes, but they are not anywhere near the level we need if we are to give people meaningful alternatives in terms of public transport, especially in rural communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300015#N00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645615320,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Barry.  There is an elephant in the room when it comes to the cost-of-living crisis facing ordinary people.  It is an elephant the Government, in particular, does not want to talk about and denies exists.  That is the profiteering by big energy companies in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has denied it but we have the proof.  Energia, in the six months up to the end of September 2021, announced three price increases.  In those same six months, it made more than &euro;130 million in profits.  That is a 51% increase year on year.  Stop to think about that for a minute: hiking up prices while profits are soaring.<\/p>  <p>  For some of us, the high price of energy is a cause of poverty and of choosing between heating and eating, but for others, it is the source of riches.  Big companies, in particular, that generate energy Corrib gas, wind and hydropower have taken the opportunity to drive up prices while their costs remain the same.  The result is massive windfall profits in the process.  We need a special windfall tax on the profits of the big energy companies and we need to use that money to invest in bringing down energy bills for ordinary people.<\/p>  <p>  High energy prices hit those who are already struggling.  Ireland has among the highest deaths from cold-related diseases.  Some 2,800 people die per year.  Those worst affected are the elderly, single parents and their children, and Travellers.  However, the Government's proposals for tackling the energy and cost-of-living crises are hopelessly inadequate, and I think it knows it.  A much more fundamental programme of measures is essential.<\/p>  <p>  The Government does not want to talk about it but it has the power to impose maximum price orders on electricity, home heating oil and gas.  It should use that power.  Do not say it is not possible because the costs are going up.  Look at the profits I just pointed to in the form of Energia.  Cut into those profits with a maximum price order to ensure people can afford to heat their homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will impose a carbon tax increase in May.  It should withdraw it.  It should withdraw the carbon tax, which is entirely ineffective from the point of view of tackling climate change and puts the burden on ordinary people.  The Government should order an immediate rent freeze and then set up an independent rental review board that would enable tenants to seek rent reductions, because that is what is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We have the most expensive childcare service in Europe.  We need a publicly run, not-for-profit system to provide high-quality care that is urgently needed, while removing the ruinously expensive costs of private childcare.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has cut public transport fares by 20%.  We welcome that, but why not go the whole way?  Why not make public transport free?  Why not make a real difference to the cost of living for many people while sharply reducing carbon emissions?  Transport is the number two emitting sector in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The figures given are interesting.  The Government now estimates a &euro;54 million cost of a 20% fare cut for nine months.  That indicates a full-year cost of making public transport free for everybody of &euro;360 million.  That is substantially less than the Government has always indicated to us in parliamentary questions the cost would be when we have been campaigning for free public transport.  The Government should do it, but obviously that is not enough.  We need to invest and then extend public transport nationwide in order that it is free, frequent and fast throughout the cities and towns of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The other point I want to make is essential to this.  I saw Patrick O'Donovan referenced as being on a radio station this morning saying we had to have Shannon LNG because the wind did not blow all the time etc.  That is just a recipe for continuing with fossil fuel dependency.  There should be no more fossil fuel infrastructure whatsoever and there should be a rapid transition to renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  A vital part of achieving that rapid transition is reducing energy usage.  That is why are opposed to the expansion of data centres.  It is not possible to walk down an upwards-moving escalator.  We have to reduce energy usage in this country.  A crucial way to do this is a programme of retrofitting.<\/p> <p>I do not mean a scheme of the kind the Government has, whereby if you have &euro;25,000 the State will match it and then you can do it.  I want a scheme that on a public basis creates huge numbers of green jobs to retrofit at zero upfront cost to the householder and then shares the benefit over a period of 15 or 20 years between the householder and the State.  The State can borrow at practically 0% right now.  The upfront cost of this would be &euro;2 billion but over time it absolutely pays for itself in the benefit to the householder of having a warm, well-insulated house, saving money on energy bills and from the point of view of all of in society through reduced energy usage and carbon emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300016#O00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645615920,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is reported in the press this morning as saying families should brace themselves for the pain.

However, there is profiteering taking place in Irish society.  These are not just acts of God.  Yesterday, I gave the example of Musgrave Group's &euro;98 million profit.  What is going on there?

I think nearly &euro;500 million has been put into the system.  The question I always ask is where we are going to get the money to pay for it.  The Minister is probably asking himself the same question.<\/p>  <p>  Issues abound in the farming sector.  The unprecedented rise in costs is causing severe problems for farmers.  This has been borne out by the CSO figures released this week.  The figures show the huge financial challenges being faced by farmers as input costs wipe out any marginal increases in output costs.  I will briefly expand on that.  Fertiliser prices went up almost 25% in December 2020 and overall in that year went up by 86.9% in 2020.  That is the fuel to grow our grass, silage and crops so we have food we can sell to the shops.  Electricity prices have gone up over 22%.  Fuel prices have gone up 40%.  Feedstuff prices have gone up 15.9%.  The price of the plastic needed to wrap the bales of silage has doubled and will add to the increased costs of harvesting the round bale for farmers.  On the other side of the coin, farming is unique in that farmers cannot dictate what the price will be for their product at day's end.  They are what we call price-takers and are at the mercy of the market.  They are at the mercy of the meat producers and when they go to the mart to sell their stock they are at the mercy of what price they are given.  They cannot set the price.  In most industries, if there is an increase in production costs it is added to the sales price to try to recover that cost.  That facility is not available to farmers and they are in a serious predicament.  There is no avenue to add this cost onto the selling price of their stock.  We all know the wording when you buy a calf has always been: \"Did you get good value?\".  You would always be told: \"You will know the value of that calf the day I go to sell him\".  That is the way farming works; no other way.  It is important we take that into account when we look at what is happening with farming.<\/p>  <p>  It has been alluded to that the volatility between Russia and Ukraine, Europe and all that is creating additional pressures on prices of basic materials used throughout industry worldwide, fuel in particular.  This is something no-one can blame the Government for or anything like that but we must take these things into account when we look at farmers and how we can support them.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers need support right now and I will tell the Minister why.  It is not so much that the farmer is thinking about what he is going to do.  Young farmers and farmers generally are making decisions right now that they are not going to buy as much fertiliser because they cannot afford it.  They are not buying cattle but thinking about selling.  The knock-on effect down the line will be that we will be producing less food.  We will also have a situation where young people are running away from the responsibility of trying to run the family farm.  I have spoken to about five sets of parents this week who have told me nobody is willing to take on the farm.  What do we do then?  In my constituency of Galway East we have had investment in, and will soon have opened, the BIA Innovator Campus in Athenry.  It is supported by Government through the rural regeneration fund and will be a great place to create perhaps 200 jobs in the food industry.  However, if we continue with the situation we have we will not have the raw materials for the food innovation to happen so we can increase our exports.  I am referring to the export of products that are recognised worldwide.  That is where we are coming to with farming.  The important question is how we support farming right now.  There are a number of things we must do or the small family farm will be wiped out and we will end up with large tracts of land being farmed by industrial-type farmers.  The family farm, which is the fabric of rural Ireland, is in serious danger.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine earlier and did not get much confidence from what he was saying about next year and the year after.  He was talking about CAP and different grants that might be happening.  He is talking about a 2% increase in something when we have 89% increases in the cost of some raw materials.  We must look at this very seriously and do so urgently.  Farmers need some sort of hope.  They need some sort of pathway to be created.  They need direct subventions right now.  They need to be exempted from VAT.  For the moment, they also need an exemption from the carbon tax.  These need to be considered as a matter of urgency.  The other aspect to farming some people may not realise is the lack of transparency in the price set for the finished product is causing huge problems in the farming industry.  We must ensure the price is regulated such that no products are being sold below cost.  Right now farming products are being sold below cost and that is not sustainable in any walk or field.  As I said, we are supporting industry and even through the LEADER programme we are supporting small industry to develop, such as cheesemaking and artisan foods.<\/p> <p>That is great, but if we do not have the supply chain of beef, lamb, milk and grain, we will not sustain this industry.  We will not sustain jobs in the towns and cities that can sustain them.  We are experiencing a significant knock-on effect.  My plea to the Government today is to consider this matter as an urgent crisis for farming.  I do not say it to scaremonger, but because of the experience I have.  A young farmer told me he can only afford to buy a third of the fertiliser this year that he bought last year.  What will happen is that his production levels will do down and his profits will go down.  He is in his 40s and in a few years, he will be looking for an out.  I am delighted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is here to listen to us.  I again thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward the motion.  It is important that farming is recognised as being in a crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300017#P00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645616520,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this most comprehensive motion which captures the impact of rapidly rising inflation and the high cost of living, which affects every Irish citizen, but disproportionately affects those on lower incomes, middle incomes and, above all, fixed incomes.  The motion captures many of the specific cost increases for those who work and live in rural areas, in addition to the increases already felt by all Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to make the point that those who live and work in rural areas have specific challenges when it comes to rising costs.  I understand housing costs and childcare costs are less in rural areas than they are in urban areas, but we must recognise the specific extra costs in rural areas to ensure balance and meaningful debate.<\/p>  <p>  I will first look at some of the issues that are specific to those who live and work in rural areas.  I will start with those engaged in agriculture.  This motion speaks of the three Fs: fuel, fertiliser and feed.  The three Fs capture very clearly the specific extra costs incurred by primary producers, farmers.  In the past 12 months there has been a feed price hike of between &euro;15 and &euro;20 per tonne.  That was just to the end of last year.  This is a massive cost for many farmers, yet they are expected to absorb it.  We also know that feed costs could increase further because, unfortunately, the soya forecasts in certain South American countries have decreased due to drought.  This is an escalating problem, and one that farmers must contend with on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis.<\/p>  <p>  However, that is not the only increase farmers are facing.  In 2021, the price of petrol rose by 27% and diesel by 26%.  This has escalated further this year.  Every single week we see an increase at the pumps.  We are the 17th most expensive country for fuel in the world.  Farmers need to use fuel specifically to carry out their farming activities, whether it is a fill of diesel for their tractor, or the electricity used in the various farming activities.  We also have a significant rise in fertiliser costs, which is crippling farmers.  There is no sign that those prices will reduce or ease in the short term.  Fertiliser prices increased by almost 90% in the year to 2021.  This is totally unsustainable.  What makes it even more unsustainable is that the price of food has no connection to the cost of producing it.  Any link between the production of food and its price is totally broken.  Those who take the hit are the primary producers, the farmers.  We urgently need a regulator to ensure a fair distribution of profits throughout the supply chain.  I and many others have called for this for so many years.  The current situation once again highlights the absolute need for fairness in the food supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers are squeezed at both ends due to the rising costs of virtually all inputs, but at the same time CSO figures show that food prices in December 2021 were 90% of what they were in December 2010.  This situation is untenable.  While I welcome the &euro;7 million package for the pig industry, which will make a real difference, farmers are business people and they want an opportunity to make a living and to earn a living and not to have to rely on once-off Government payments.  I accept that the &euro;7 million will help to keep many pig farmers afloat.  I do not diminish its importance, but in the overall context, the year-to-year context, rather than the day-to-day context or the week-to-week context, farmers, primary producers, must be in a position to earn their living and to make some money from what they do, rather than having to call on the Government for a special fund or a unique response to a particular set of circumstances.  The Minister and I know that farmers are price takers.  They have no real power, and they rely on State intervention.  In this case, a regulator with powers of enforcement is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, those who live in rural areas have limited access or in some cases no access whatsoever to rural transport, so the increasing cost at the local pumps has a disproportionate impact.  I support the call in the motion for the Government to reduce the excise duty on fuel.  This will impact on those in rural areas and in urban areas.  While a 20% decrease in Luas tickets is most welcome, very few people in my constituency will see any benefit from it.  A reduction in excise on fuel would have a real impact because energy poverty stalks both rural and urban Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The motion also asks the Minister to reduce the VAT wedge on fuels and energy for six months.  Unfortunately, because of the situation in Ukraine, I honestly believe the Minister must do something like this because the impact of the actions so far by the Russians will simply be to increase fuel prices.  The State cannot continue to place a greater percentage of the increased costs on its citizens because it is crucifying people.<\/p>  <p>  I do not hold the same view as the Rural Independent Group on carbon tax.  To me, this is a ring-fenced fixed tax which will go to those who need it most when it comes to retrofitting homes.  Retrofitting is a medium and long-term solution.  It is never easy for the Government to fund good outcomes in four, five or ten years.  That is a positive step, but the Government has a responsibility to deal with the immediate problems also.  The cost of living increases are hurting middle and lower income earners and those on fixed incomes, because they spend so much more of their income on food and fuel.  I commend the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300018#Q00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1645616520,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for the contributions they have made to this very important debate.

We stand proud over this motion.  It is what the people are telling us.  We are in touch with the people.  We are not going to listen to arrogance and petulance from a Minister who normally leaves the Chamber before we speak, but he got caught here today.  He does not like us for some reason or another.  We know the facts.  The Government promised in the 2016 budget that it would abolish the USC.  What has happened to that promise?  The Minister mentioned the double taxation allowance.  Some 80% of the work in agriculture is done by contractors.  They do not qualify for that allowance.  If the Minister ever left the leafy suburbs of Dublin, put on a pair of wellington boots and stood in a field he would understand that.  This Government is the Dublin 4 set.  The Dublin 4 set will get it from the people.  T&aacute; na daoine an-chrosta ar fad.<\/p> <p>Of course we voted against this joke of a carbon tax.  We are opposed to it because it is a punitive tax, is not fairly spread and hits the weakest and most vulnerable people and rural dwellers the hardest.  Unless they walk, they cannot get anyplace without a motor vehicle.  The Minister's party bought into government and into power and clung onto it by supporting the Greens.  It is dancing their merry tune since forming the Government.<\/p> <p> The cost increases out there are shocking.  The cost of living is so high.  I do not have time to repeat them all but I have them.  We all know when we consider mom's purse of a Friday evening.  All of us who have children in college or school know of the costs of school uniforms, books, you name it.<\/p> <p> Concerning the agricultural sector, the Government is welded to the big conglomerates and the multiple billions of profit they make.  Not a word is said to them.  Fine Gael is welded to them and now Fianna F&aacute;il is as well.  The latter used to be the party of the ordinary people and now is the party of the rich conglomerates.  The aforementioned parties are cutting off their nose to spite their face, closing down our power stations because of the pipe dream the Greens have, stopping peat harvesting and importing it from Poland.  If the Minister wants to insult us, I will not be insulting but kindergarten children would not behave like that.  It is utterly stupid and nonsense.  The Government has broken promise after promise.  We are proud to bring this motion.<\/p> <p> The Government put down an amendment.  I thank the ushers for searching but I could not get a copy of that amendment.  They will not even give us a copy to read.  They put it down, move it and say we would not listen.  We listen intently, unlike the Minister.  When our turn comes to speak, he flies out like a scalded cat through a skylight, in case we remind him of some truths.  The USC is a punitive tax on all earners, especially low earners, and was supposed to be removed but was not.  Farmers are struggling and cannot eke out a living.  Farm families are the backbone of all rural communities.  Rural and urban families cannot afford heating.  The Government can do it.  Sweden was able to drop oil prices back to 2018 levels through VAT and excise duty reductions.  Why can the Minister not do that?  He tells us we did not cost our budget.  That is simple addition.  Oil at the moment is &euro;1.70 per litre and a euro of that goes into Government coffers through VAT, excise duty and carbon tax.  Another carbon hike is on the way.  The Minister will force it through with this cobbled-up Government.  It is a liquorice allsorts or dolly mixture.<\/p> <p> On the costs of ordinary household items, margarine is up by 37%, vegetable oil by 16% and pasta by 15%.  These are basic requirements for people to live and have nourishment.  I see the Minister does not use much honey by the way he mixes with us, but jam and honey are up by 14%.  Lamb is up by 12%, milk by 9%, eggs are up, etc. <\/p> <p>The paltry sum being given to the pig farmers means we will not have a pig industry.  I welcome the &euro;7 million because millions do not grow on trees, but they are in trouble and losing a vast amount of money per item.  One thing the Government could do for the country that has nothing to do with money is to speed up the passport or visa applications for people who want to come to work in the pig industry.  In factories in the north of Ireland they are down to 60% of previous staffing levels.  They cannot kill the pigs.  There is an animal welfare crisis and a huge crisis concerning farmers getting paid and the animals being returned.  Across the economy, it is simple and would not cost a penny.  Wake up in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and get the workers who want to come in.  Many good employers have gone out to source this labour.  They want to get the paperwork sorted out.  Applications are being dealt with since last October.<\/p> <p> The last three recessions I remember, it was feirmeoir&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, the farmers, who rescued our economy each time.  They provided for people and everything else and will do it again but their spirit is nearly broken.  The candle is nearly quenched because the conglomerates are around them, forcing down the prices of products and then buying up the land.  The Government and, particularly, the Minister have given an open door to vulture founds and such people to buy up land.  It is an abject wrong that if I have a property it can be sold on by a bank or lending institution to a vulture fund.  That is not legal but the Government turns a blind eye to it.  Laws and people do not matter anymore.  All the Government is interested in is letting the big conglomerates do what they like.  A warning has come from Tesco that we are only at the beginning of the price hikes.  Consider the money Tesco makes and it does not bank a penny of it in this country, as I understand.  The big conglomerates are beautiful and the Government loves them.  The small businessman employing himself and the farmer employing a son or daughter and maybe one or two labourers pay contractors and pay everybody.  They are honest people but will be unable to pay because they cannot keep going the way they are. <\/p> <p> We plead with the Government and it puts down a half-baked amendment and will not give us a copy to read.  Is paper that scarce?  Has the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, placed an embargo on printing amendments?  Time after time we come in for Topical Issues, etc., and cannot get copies of the Ministers' replies because they are embarrassed to have them read out and should be embarrassed of the amendment put in today.  <\/p> <p> Fine Gael is supposed to be the farmers' party.  That is what we always knew it as but it has abandoned rural Ireland and the people.  It is clinging onto power for ten or 11 years to ensure pensions and everything else.  Cromwell was not as bad with \"To hell or to Connacht\".  It is to hell or anyplace else now with the farmers and their families.  The schools, post offices and every facet of rural Ireland will be undermined and attacked.  Earlier, the Minister had a fine chat with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, maybe about the trade mission he was on.  I hope that was successful.  It was when Deputy Nolan was speaking and was the height of you-know-what.  The Minister lectures us then about not costing.  He has whole Departments to cost.  What happened when Mr. Watt got his big raise?  Who costed that?  They do nothing but write cheques.  Consider the money the HSE spent and the scams being exposed by papers.<\/p> <p> Look after the farming community or we will not have it.  Look after the people of rural Ireland because they will not be able to live.  They will be dying in their houses with the cold.  The Minister talks about retrofit schemes, which are already two years behind in my county and every other place.  They must have &euro;500 up front, which many families do not have, to get the house assessed.  They do not have that floating around because they are living from week to week and day to day.  <\/p> <p> I understand I am taking other people's time so I will respectfully end my contribution.  However, I will not take a lecture from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, ever again because he has reneged on every promise he has made in the last ten or 15 years.  He tells us we do not cost it.  In light of his costings on the children's hospital and any other project he has done, including broadband, he has some cheek to tell us we did not cost it.  It is laughable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300019#R07700","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645617720,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1645617720,"counter":184,"content":"<p>A vote has been called and is deferred until the voting block this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300020#S00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1645617720,"counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300020#S00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1645617720,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar ais roimh an Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300020#S00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1645617720,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Last Wednesday night, the Government voted again to ensure cuckoo funds continue to pay no tax and outbid workers and families for homes they desperately need.  Those funds were back in the news at the weekend.  The first story was about a Dutch outfit paying &euro;110 million to hoover up 280 family homes in Dublin.  The CEO of that outfit said it could own the houses for 50 years and is not selling them.  In 50 years, the grandchildren of those struggling to buy a house today will be looking for a home of their own.  Another story concerns a couple who cannot buy a house living in the house of a family member, which is a common story, even though they had saved a substantial deposit.  They are infuriated that the Government continues to support cuckoo funds at the expense of ordinary home buyers.<\/p>  <p>  Here is another story.  Bartra, the private developer awarded the contract for O'Devaney Gardens, is threatening to sell 500 family homes to a cuckoo fund unless the Government dances to its tune.  Bartra was given the valuable public land at O'Devaney Gardens effectively for free.  <\/p> <p>Not content with that sweetheart deal, and a huge subsidy from the public purse, it now wants more.  It demands that the Government buy these homes at inflated prices of more than &euro;400,000, or it says it will sell to a fund, which in turn will fleece people with rip-off rents.  The developer is effectively trying to blackmail the taxpayer and is using the powerful presence of cuckoo funds as leverage.  This is not its first act of bad faith; far from it.  There have been huge delays in building these homes.  It has challenged planning decisions and mounted a judicial review.  It is now brazenly attempting to hold the Taoiseach's Government to ransom.<\/p> <p> This would not be happening if the Government had provided Dublin City Council with the financial support needed to develop these homes back in 2018.  That proposal would have seen the delivery of 800 homes that ordinary people could actually afford to rent or buy.  That is what we in Sinn F&eacute;in and others called for.  Had the Government listened to us, O'Devaney Gardens would be at an advanced stage of construction, ready for families to move in next year.  Instead, this deal, which the Taoiseach has championed to the hilt, means that these homes have not been built.  When the first homes eventually come on stream, Bartra will slap a price tag of &euro;400,000 on them, which will be way beyond the reach of ordinary workers and families.<\/p> <p> Cinnteoidh talamh poibl&iacute; a dtugtar saor in aisce do na forbr&oacute;ir&iacute; chun tithe a th&oacute;g&aacute;il at&aacute; r&oacute;chostasach i gcomhair daoine go leanfaidh g&eacute;arch&eacute;im tith&iacute;ochta ar aghaidh.

The Government was warned at the time and again that this was a terrible deal for tenants, homeowners and taxpayers.  The Government was warned that sidelining the local authority and gifting public land to private developers was a really bad idea.  Does the Taoiseach now accept those facts?  What is his response to Bartra and its attempts to blackmail the taxpayer?  What does he say now to Bartra?  Will he now rein in these cuckoo funds by ending the sweetheart tax deals that his Government has afforded to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300020#S00600","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645618320,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of housing, because I have repeatedly said that, in my view, housing is the single most urgent and important social issue facing our country at this point in time.  Access to housing is fundamental to our security, stability, health and progress as a society.  If we do not recognise the scale of the challenge and respond in kind, then this has the potential to be profoundly destabilising for society and to deprive many younger generations of the capacity to access housing in terms of being able to buy or rent at affordable rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy developed by this Government in the last year and a half is unprecedented in scale and investment, with more than &euro;4 billion in State investment.  It is the largest ever amount of social housing to be built year-by-year, with well up to 10,000 in 2022, between local authorities and approved social housing bodies.  I refer as well to providing and supporting the provision of affordable housing, as well as cost rental and private development.  As I said to the Deputy the week before last, regarding private rental, for example, of the 33,000 units that we are aiming to provide year-by-year, about 6,000 of those will be private rental.  The Deputy acknowledged that there would be a need for private housing, in addition to social housing, State-supported affordable housing and cost-rental housing. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is rewriting the narrative again today, because, unfortunately for her, the housing issue has all been about politics.  The O'Devaney Gardens project would have been built a long time ago if it was not for people playing politics with it.  It is either the Sinn F&eacute;in way or the highway.  We either build houses its way or we will never build houses.  It will always be against any sort of mixed tenure approach, or an approach that involves a mixture of social, affordable and private housing.

Collectively, as a House we should, if possible, unanimously condemn what the Russian Federation has done by recognising its client states in the Donbas region of Ukraine.  I hope there will be cross-party support for a motion.  I formally ask the Taoiseach to put forward a motion to the House that all of us can support.  We want to avoid war but it is clear who the aggressor is.<\/p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council yesterday, our ambassador made clear our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity with its recognised borders.  What further action will Ireland take at the Security Council?  The Taoiseach met with the German Chancellor yesterday, who announced that the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would not go ahead.  Will the Taoiseach send a clear message about what sanctions will be put in place?<\/p>  <p>  As documented by Fintan O'Toole yesterday, between 2005 and 2017, &euro;118 billion was funnelled through the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, to Russian entities.  Let me repeat that figure: &euro;118 billion.  We are at risk of becoming the best small country in the world to funnel corrupt dirty Russian oligarchs' money, mostly through section 110 companies that pay little, if any, tax and with no real transparency of who the beneficial owners are.  Oligarchs are washing money through countries like our own because they cannot trust their own banking system because it is so corrupt.  If sanctions by the US, the UK and the EU lead to a clampdown on Russian billionaires, there is a likelihood that oligarchs and their shell companies, thousands of them, may seek to use Ireland to continue to funnel money.  What are we and the Government going to do about it?  I do not need to tell the Taoiseach about the impact all of this has on energy prices and the costs that will affect consumers.  Can we look for a derogation from the EU on our historic 13.5% on electricity and gas to allow it to be reduced and then returned?<\/p>  <p>  There are three components to my question.  What actions will Ireland take at the Security Council and what sanctions will the Taoiseach implement?  Will he bring forward a motion that we can collectively support and show our true colours by condemning the Russian Federation for its actions?  Second, will he ensure that Russian money flowing through Ireland is targeted, because this is deeply concerning?  In addition, will he look at the cost of energy prices going forward and look for a derogation from the EU on VAT rules?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300022#U02500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1645618920,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  In the first instance, along with the Deputy and in the clearest possible terms, I want to condemn Russia's aggression towards its neighbour.  It is unilaterally, without any justification whatsoever, threatening and undermining the integrity of an independent democratic state, and this is unacceptable.  I agree with the Deputy and I have no difficulty in agreeing a joint motion in the House because Russia's behaviour deserves the unequivocal condemnation of everyone in the House.  Our country's support for Ukrainian sovereignty, territorial integrity and its right to choose its own foreign and security policy is unwavering.<\/p>  <p>  We have to send out a clear and strong signal in terms of our support for Ukrainian sovereignty.  We made that clear at the UN Security Council emergency meeting, which was held on 21 January, and this continues to be our position.  The situation at the Security Council in itself is challenging.  Russian is a permanent member of the Council and has veto power.  We have witnessed a major escalation, which clearly contravenes international law in terms of the Russian decision to proceed with recognition of the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent entities.  The decision to move military personnel to those areas represents a major escalation and creates a challenging situation all round.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of sanctions, we are part of the EU-wide sanctions regime.  The European Union along with the United States, and working in concert with other like-minded countries that value democracy, have agreed a range of sanctions in terms of the listing of individuals, 27 influential oligarchs, business people, politicians, and military leaders, the Russian minister for defence, military commanders leading the operation, individuals from the media, propaganda sectors, 351 MPs in the Russian Duma who voted for the recognition, of which 22 are already listed, the listing of entities and asset freeze.  This is in addition to the myriad of Crimea-related sanctions regime in terms of imports and exports into the Donbas region, as well as financial restrictions prohibiting on lending to the Russian central bank, and asset freezes of two private banks.<\/p>  <p>  On the IFSC and the report to which the Deputy referred in respect of 2005 and 2017 and billions being funnelled through the IFSC to Russian entities, we will share in any sanctions with the European Union and we will support all sanctions, including the targeting of the ability of the Russian state to access the European Union's capital and financial markets, which will be a significant sanction in itself.  The financial services offering of the IFSC, as the Deputy knows, relates to special purpose vehicles.

My colleague, Deputy Howlin, brought forward the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, known as the Magnitsky Bill, in 2020.  We should bring this through the House, because the legislation of 2018 referred to by the Taoiseach is, unfortunately, simply not covering it.  Collectively, we must seriously consider it.  Deputy Howlin brought this Bill forward and we are open to changes, but this is absolutely necessary now.<\/p>  <p>  This country has to lead by example in terms of what is going on.  This is a very dangerous period for the world and Europe and we have to lead by example.  We have a big role in the UN Security Council.  In fairness, the Taoiseach had a big meeting yesterday, but we also need to lead and show that we will not tolerate a country that behaves in this manner, namely, the Russian Federation, and we will deal with it in the manner in which can deal with it through the legislation I propose.

The approach all along by the European Union has been to work in concert and that unity is our strength.<\/p> <p>It is a very dark moment for European history and the Continent.  It is very serious.  The sheer scale of the militarisation on the border of Ukraine is something we would have thought was a relic of the past, of the Second World War or previous wars.  The whole ideological approach from President Putin, the idea that the Bolsheviks got it wrong and that Ukraine does not have a right to exist, has a chilling impact on small states like our own enjoys 100 years of unbroken democracy.  The era of states believing they have a sphere of influence and can control smaller neighbours and tell them they cannot join an organisation and must do this or that is over.  We can never accept that.  The most troubling aspect of the last couple of days has been the content of that speech.  It harks back to a completely different era in a different century.

Last week we pointed out the enormous jump in profits for energy companies, electricity suppliers, oil companies and so on.<\/p><p>The latest evidence for the argument we are making, which the Government is determinedly ignoring, comes in the form of IRES REIT's accounts.  It is the biggest landlord in the country, a property investment fund that saw its profits jump in 2021 by 15.8%, up to &euro;67.5 million.  Its investment properties grew by 6.7% up to &euro;79.7 million.  A figure I find really shocking is that its net rental income margin was 79%.  The corporate landlords, the property investors, are absolutely creaming it on the back of the cost of living misery and absolutely obscene rents that are being charged to their tenants.  We can just see it.<\/p><p>The <i>daft.ie<\/i>figures at the beginning of this month showed rents were up by 10.3% year on year for the last quarter.  It had been 7% during the pandemic, already dramatic increases, rising as soon as the pandemic ends.  In some parts of rural Ireland rents are up by as much as 22%.  Average rents are now &euro;1,524 a month.  In south Dublin the average is &euro;2,258 and across Dublin city it is &euro;2,145.  This leads directly to more people facing homelessness.  During the pandemic when the Government was forced, under pressure, to introduce an eviction ban and a ban on further rent increases, the number of families and individuals in homeless accommodation dropped to about 7,000.  It has steadily risen since those bans were lifted and is now up to 9,000.  We do not have the figures yet for the beginning of 2020 but I can tell the House they are going to go up.  We will be back towards the figure of 10,000 individuals and families who are homeless.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach finally do something about the profiteering and price gouging of landlords and introduce actual rent controls similar, for example, to those that have been introduced in the last two years in France, where they are now setting maximum reference rents above which landlords cannot go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300023#V00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1645619520,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We have introduced rent restrictions in this country.  I am just back from Berlin.  The rent freeze there did not work at all; it had a completely dysfunctional impact on the market.  We have to learn lessons.  I read the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report.  The fundamental point is that we need to build more houses.  Building 20,000 houses a year is not enough.  It is a huge factor in terms of where rents are.  We have really to concentrate on getting houses built as fast as we possibly can.  That means social and affordable houses and private development as well.  Some of that will be private rental.  The institutional funds represent about 7% of the rental market across the country, not the entirety of the market at all.  As I have said repeatedly, of that 33,000 figure we expect 6,000 on an ongoing basis would be of a private rental nature but the bulk of it will be up to 10,000 social houses directly built through funding from the State through local authorities or approved social housing bodies.  The biggest rent supports are through the housing assistance programme, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which are funded by the State and the taxpayer.<\/p><p>There is an enormous, unprecedented allocation of funding to get houses built in this country.  Thankfully 31,000 homes were commenced in 2021, which really illustrates for the first time in quite a while that we are making progress.  The pandemic and long lockdown did hit us and impact on construction and supply in 2020 and 2021 but we are catching up fast.  The figure of 31,000 homes is the highest since 2008.  We had about 20,400 completed in 2021 and the number of apartments completed increased by over 30%.  We actually need that increase.  We need a whole range of house and apartment types built if we are ever to get near the scale that we need to be at consistently over a ten-year period.  There I times when I think people do not realise the scale of what is involved or the need to do what we have to do.  About 46,000 homes were purchased in 2021, about 30% of which were bought by first-time buyers.  There were nearly 40,000 planning permissions granted in the year to Q3 2021.  In terms of the capacity of the industry, construction apprenticeship registrations in 2021 increased by over 40% compared to 2019.  Employment in construction is back to pre-pandemic levels.  Housing for All is working but it is going to take a number of years to get to where we want to be, unfortunately.

The biggest fantasy the Taoiseach is peddling is that the Government is delivering additional social housing in any substantial numbers.  In the first three quarters of last year, actual construction of new social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies was 1,084 in the entire country.  The Government is getting the rest from the same build-to-rent private developers who are creaming it and charging extortionate rents.

The public purse is being used by those at the most senior level to enhance their own salaries and, in other cases, to advance policy initiatives the Government has not underwritten.  We have seen these questionable practices in the appointment of the Secretary General of the Department of Health on an unjustifiable salary and the actions of the Office of the Planning Regulator in the application of policy other than that of the line Minister.  There are many other examples.<\/p>  <p>  In early January of this year, following a complaint in 2019, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, issued one of the most damning reports in its history.  It exposed most inappropriate behaviour by Wexford County Council's chief executive, Tom Enright, and the then cathaoirleach, Fianna F&aacute;il councillor Michael Sheehan.  Mr. Enright was found to have used the weight of the public purse in an attempt to influence the editorial output of South East Radio, something you might see in Mother Russia.  Within two days of the issuing of the report, the Fianna F&aacute;il chair of Wexford County Council, Councillor Barbara-Anne Murphy, called a meeting to immediately push through a vote supporting the chief executive, ignoring the findings of the SIPO report, her own legal advice and established custom and practice for dealing with serious disciplinary matters concerning a chief executive.  It was an action for which she herself should be sanctioned.  The vote was controlled and rammed through by councillors of the two main parties, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the parties in government.  They made a laughing stock of SIPO effectively by giving it the two fingers.  SIPO's 376-page report had taken two years to compile.  Other senior officials, including the county secretary and directors of services, made contact with councillors to impress upon them the importance of supporting the chief executive in a vote.  Implicit in that contact was that the potholes and footpaths in councillors' areas would not be attended to if they did not support their man.  This action should be investigated in its own right and for which those concerned should be sanctioned.  As one junior official in Wexford County Council put it to me, these votes will cost the council money.<\/p>  <p>  Do the Taoiseach and his party recognise the importance of SIPO and its findings as a mechanism for maintaining public confidence in the civil and public service?

There is no doubt there are strengths and weaknesses, but overall Irish public servants have done well by the State since its foundation.  That has been made manifest most recently in the public service's response to Covid-19, an unprecedented once-in-100-years pandemic, at national and local levels.  Therefore, let us not tar everybody with the same brush regarding one particular issue, development, incident or action in one local authority.  I believe in the Irish public service.  I have my criticisms and frustrations, but fundamentally in respect of how this State is organised, we need a strong public service and to ensure it is adequately resourced and given the leadership it requires.  That is fundamental to a parliamentary democracy.  That is my view on that.<\/p>  <p>  On local democracy, we delegate authority to local councils.  They may not always decide on policies or issues we are happy with or agree with and we may disagree with actions taken.  My understanding of the first council meeting is that councils are obliged under statute to convene a meeting after a SIPO report.  I can check that, but that is my understanding.  The first meeting would have been adjourned until a subsequent meeting.  A SIPO report should be taken very seriously, of course, in respect of actions.  With regard to a more general principle &mdash; I do not have the full background here &mdash;  as far as I am concerned there has to be a very clear demarcation line between governments, be they local or national, and media.

In 2021, a replacement NDLS front office service was procured, and then it was decided by the Road Safety Authority to provide the service on the basis of appointments only.

The Kerry representatives at the time made a very effective appeal and the result was that Kerry won one or two All-Ireland titles as a result.

As recommended in the commission's report, implementation of the plan is being overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The policing reform implementation programme office monitors progress on A Policing Service for our Future and supports the work of the implementation group on policing reform, which has an independent chair, Ms Helen Ryan.  The office also keeps the high-level steering board on policing reform, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, apprised of progress being made.  In addition, progress is regularly reported to the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality.  The programme office has been resourced with appropriate expertise in the areas of project management, policing, justice and public service reform.<\/p><p>A Policing Service for our Future is a living document which is reviewed and updated by the programme office as required to maintain ambitious but realistic commitments, timeframes and milestones.  A Policing Service for our Future is broken down into four stages of implementation, namely, the building blocks phase, the launching phase, the scaling phase and the consolidation phase.  The first three phases have been completed and much has been achieved.  The roll-out of a new operating model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide, is under way.  The recruitment of nearly 1,800 Garda staff has supported the reassignment of many garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties, and the roll-out of over 5,000 digital communication devices enables front-line garda&iacute; to perform their duties without returning to stations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a human rights unit and re-established the strategic human rights advisory committee.  There are pilots of local community safety partnerships in three locations around the country, in Dublin's north inner city, Waterford city and county and Longford county.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed an equality, diversity and inclusion strategy statement and action plan 2020-21 and has launched a three-year Garda health and well-being strategy, which will see the introduction of additional health and well-being supports.<\/p><p>There has also been progress on legislative reform.  The Government has approved the drafting of the landmark policing, security and community safety Bill, which provides for the most wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (digital recordings) Bill, which concerns the use of recording devices, including body-worn cameras; and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (powers) Bill, which brings together and modernises police powers of search, arrest and detention.<\/p><p>These measures and achievements represent only some of the wide range of actions completed or being progressed under the plan, and further detailed information on the implementation of the reform programme is available on <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  The implementation group on policing reform and the policing reform implementation programme office have been, and continue to be, actively engaged with key stakeholders to ensure continued momentum on reform.  Consideration is currently being given to the best way of approaching the final or consolidation phase of the reform programme to ensure that policing in Ireland is transformed in line with the vision elaborated in the commission's report and that, into the future, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well positioned to manage sustainable and significant organisational improvements that meet the needs of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300028#AA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1645622520,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in Senators will bring forward a Bill this evening to amend the Coroners Act to facilitate a transparent jury selection process for the Stardust inquest.  The legislation will allow the coroner to use the same mechanisms as those used by the courts for jury selection, including the use of the electoral register.  Most people are unaware of just how opaque and<i>ad hoc<\/i>jury selection for an inquest is.  Reforms of the system have long been sought.  Currently, the Garda maintains its own list of jurors for inquests who are, in turn, used multiple times.  If the Garda cannot draw a jury from this list alone, the Garda can randomly seek out jurors.  Indeed, garda&iacute; have been known to visit public sector places of work to see if anyone is free.  It is worth noting, by the way, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a party to the Stardust inquest.  Jurors can be known to victims' families, yet legal teams cannot dismiss them.  In addition, jurors' work-related income is not protected, as happens in the courts.  This is particularly relevant for the Stardust inquest as it will take place over a number of months.  It should be clear that a jury is needed for the Stardust inquest, as per section 40 of the Coroners Act.  This has been reiterated by the coroner.<\/p><p>The root and branch reform review of the coroner service that was commissioned by a previous Government of which the Taoiseach was a member was never implemented.  Just last year, Irish Council for Civil Liberties research found that Ireland's system of investigating death is inadequate and can compound and even aggravate the suffering of loved ones.  The Government has given a commitment that the Stardust inquest will be human rights compliant.  To deliver on this commitment, the matters relating to juries in terms of selection and income protection must be addressed urgently.

Can the Taoiseach provide the House and, more importantly, George's family with an indication of when this investigation might be complete?  Is he aware of any measure that has been taken either by the Garda Commissioner or the Department of Justice to ensure that all garda&iacute; involved co-operate fully with the GSOC investigation, telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth with regard to the events of 30 December 2020?  I ask this because there are increasing concerns among those close to the Nkencho family that the investigation is running into a blue wall of silence.

With regard to the Stardust inquest, I met relatives at a recent event.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation commissioned a memorial for all those who lost their lives in the Stardust inferno and tragedy.  We had a meeting afterwards.  The Government has provided resources and amended the free legal aid framework to facilitate the inquiry.  The issue in relation to the empanelling of jurors is that existing legislation, including the Coroners Act, does not facilitate the payment of jurors at an inquest.  The issue is that this will be a longer process.  The relatives have told me it could take four to six months.  Neither the Coroners Act 1962 nor the Juries Act 1976 covers this.  The inquests were directed by the then Attorney General having regard to the provisions of the Acts.  That said, I have spoken to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General on this.  I will ask them to see whether they can come up with an exceptional provision or an approach to deal with the Stardust inquiry to ensure jurors can be empanelled for the duration of the inquest.  As soon as I have details of it and clarity on it, I will bring it back to the Deputies and to the House.  Given that we have come this far it is important that we give as much closure as we possibly can, notwithstanding limitations to the coroner's inquest potentially.  Nonetheless it is important to bring this to a satisfactory completion.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Barry's question I do not have timelines on the investigation.  Ordinarily when investigations are pursued it is up to those who are investigating.  I am not clear about what he has described as \"a blue wall of silence\".  I will raise the issue with the Minister for Justice to see whether she has an indicative timeline on this.  Again, we do not intervene in investigations.  This has always been the case.  On the other hand, I can see the need for families in very difficult situations such as these to have timelines for the conclusion and completion of the investigations.  I do not have the details here in respect of where it is at right now but I will follow through and get an update on the current situation.<\/p>  <p>  I am not familiar with the case that Deputy Murphy has raised.

I would like the Taoiseach, however, to comment on the concerns raised by these front-line workers on the masking issues in their own workplaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300030#CC00400","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1645623720,"counter":423,"content":"<p>On Leaders' Questions earlier, I asked the Taoiseach to consider imposing rent controls as is being done in France.

In reality, neither is concerned about those who would be the victims of warmongering.  They are both seeking to extend their zones of geostrategic interest.<\/p>  <p>  We are very clear there needs to be an anti-war movement built, with the crucial demand there being Putin's troops out of Ukraine.

The missile bases in Romania and Poland should be removed.

Shockingly, the leaked draft report makes no mention of the decoupling of electricity prices from gas prices.  When the price of gas goes up, households pay more for wind-generated electricity too.  This is because the pricing system is essentially an auction where the cost of gas generated sets the price.  The EU and successive governments here have pushed this market pricing system for years.  Now that this is failing to deliver fair prices, the Government and a number of other countries have remained ideologically wedded to this approach.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach last November, and I am asking him again to look at it.

The second issue is that we all must watch the impact of it.  I am not clear that any real study of the socioeconomic impact on Palestinians has taken place in respect of the Bill.  I remember posing that question at times to the advocates and I did not really get a clear substantive reply as to what the impact would be on Palestinian workers.  The situation is complex.

There were a number of breakout sessions.  I was at the security and peace session.  I also chaired the session on agricultural sustainable development and food systems.  What was striking from the presentation on the security and peace was that the overwhelming concern was terrorism and imported terrorism into Africa, which is really destabilising.  Boko Haram, the Wagner Group and various mercenaries coming into Africa are causing disputes and conflicts over natural resources.  It is a huge threat.  If there was one takeaway from the summit, it was the concern among African leaders about the growth in the Sahel and other areas of terrorism, including the murdering of innocent schoolchildren and communities for all sorts of false narratives around succession, claiming autonomy for part of a country, or acting as a puppet for somebody else to take power.  There have been attempted <i>coups d'&eacute;tat <\/i>and so forth.<\/p><p>I took the opportunity when I chaired the session with the Greek Prime Minister and the President of Kenya about the importance of agriculture and food, and we discussed how Ireland developed and evolved from being just commodities-based exports to a much more integrated and sophisticated supply chain food system.

The leader of South Africa and the President of the Commission agreed to instruct both teams at the WTO to get a resolution to this as quickly as we can.  Without question, the European Union is the biggest donor of vaccines across the world, and certainly to Africa, but the levels are too low.  What was heartening is the degree to which capacity building in terms of manufacturing within Africa is now growing thanks to the European Union initiative.  We will be providing well over &euro;1.5 billion to give capacity to South Africa, Senegal and others to have their own plants.  That means technology transfers.  It is generally acknowledged that a TRIPS waiver alone will not produce jabs for arms.  What is needed is know-how, capacity and technology transfers in terms of personnel who can produce the drugs <i>in situ<\/i>locally.  That is ultimately the way to go.  In addition, Europe has committed enormous numbers of vaccines to the middle of this year to dramatically increase the take-up, which is an issue in itself, and to assist in the logistics of the roll-out of the vaccine.<br\/><br\/>In terms of Ukraine, I have to take issue with Deputy Murphy.  His anti-Americanism always trumps a rational assessment of a situation.  This is not a clash of two alliances at all.  Rather, this is the aggression of Russia.

island initiative, we are working to engage with all communities and traditions to build consensus around a shared future and to take up the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement to enhance co-operation on the island.  Our objective is to work across the whole-of-government in all-island partnerships with the Executive, the United Kingdom Government and local authorities and civil society across the island.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants to see a fully-functioning Executive in place again as soon as possible, working for all of the people of Northern Ireland and working with us to deliver beneficial North-South co-operation and investment, which is a key dimension of our shared island approach.  Last year, the Government allocated &euro;50 million from our shared island fund to move ahead with significant cross-Border investments, including the Ulster Canal, the Narrow Water Bridge project and a major new North-South research programme.  We also commenced an all-island strategic rail review with the Executive.  <\/p>  <p>  In October, the Government set out a comprehensive set of new shared island investment priorities, as part of the revised national development plan.  This is backed by a total all-island commitment of more than &euro;3.5 billion over the decade ahead, including &euro;1 billion from the shared island fund, to invest for a more connected, sustainable and prosperous island for all.  The Government also initiated the shared island dialogue series to hear from people across all communities, traditions and regions on how we can work for a shared future on this island in practical, meaningful ways.<\/p>  <p>  In our approach, the Government is taking full account of the political complexity and challenges in Northern Ireland, and is working to listen to and engage with all communities and their concerns.  We are fostering civic dialogue that is constructive, inclusive and focused on issues of shared concern for people across all traditions and communities, while also recognising challenges and different views.<\/p>  <p>  In December, I launched a report by my Department on the first year of the dialogue series.  It highlighted the views and suggestions raised across seven dialogue events which engaged more than 1,000 civic representatives and sets out how the Government is taking account of their contributions.  A copy of the report has been sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.  We are continuing the shared island dialogue series this year, moving now to in-person and regional engagements. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, participated in a dialogue on 20 January with more than 160 tourism stakeholders, from North and South, who discussed how to take up new opportunities in the sector on a shared island basis.  The next shared island dialogue is on sport and takes place tomorrow, 24 February, at the national sports campus, with participation by Minister of State with responsibility for Sport, Deputy Jack Chambers, and with in-person and online attendance by people involved in sport across the island.<\/p>  <p>  In the weeks ahead, there will also be launch events for the next shared island research publication by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, examining primary healthcare systems on the island, and by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which is finalising a comprehensive report to Government on shared island opportunities, following wide-ranging consultations over the last year.  The Government will also convene further shared island dialogue engagements through this year, and continue to engage with all communities and traditions on the island as a core part of our shared island approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300031#DD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1645624320,"counter":455,"content":"<p>At the outset, I extend my condolences and sympathies to the family of the former DUP MLA from Belfast, Christopher Stalford, on his untimely death over the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  All of us in the House can agree that there is a gap regarding not just North-South relations but relations within Northern Ireland.  It is a gap that the shared island dialogue has a great opportunity to fill.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline whether there is an appetite to increase the ambition in this calendar year to fill that gap.  I look forward to the dialogue on sport tomorrow.  Providing a platform and voice for all communities across the island to engage when there is a lack of desire from aspects of the political community to engage in this island is key and can be achieved, coming as it is as both jurisdictions are moving out of Covid-19 restrictions.

I urge everyone on our shared island to march and protest next month to mark International Women's Day and to demand change on issues such as these.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, with regard to the ten-strong, socially-distanced, solidarity stand-out organised in Limerick against femicide in 2021, I express the hope that charges against Aislinn O&rsquo;Keeffe will be dropped before her court date this Friday.

On the Government's behalf, I conveyed our sympathies personally to Jeffrey Donaldson and the wish that they be conveyed to his family.  All of us in public life know that politicians experience enormous pressures.  Words will not console his family on this occasion, but our thoughts and prayers are with them.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the third strategy on domestic violence, there has already been shared dialogue involving women on the island.  That led to the creation of an all-island women's forum.  The shared island unit stands ready.  We have said to various groups that if there are cross-Border projects that can be developed, we will allocate funding to those, provided they meet their basic objectives and thresholds.  I would like to think that the all-island women's forum will be in a position to develop important initiatives in this area of domestic violence on a cross-Border, all-island basis.  We and the unit are available to support that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Richmond raised the continuation of the dialogue series.  He referred to increasing the ambition and in-person events.  No one has put blockages up in the political sphere.  To address Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point, too, the whole shared island endeavour is without prejudice to one's constitutional position.  That is why it has gained cross-community, cross-tradition participation in civic society.  That has been quite significant.  We have significant ambition.  There are now opportunities for in-person engagement.  There is a dialogue on sport tomorrow.  There will be an online launch event in early March for the next ESRI shared island report, which examines primary healthcare systems on the island.  We are also planning for an in-person launch event for the comprehensive report to Government by the National Economic and Social Council on shared island opportunities, following its consideration by Government.  The shared island unit of my Department is also preparing further events as part of the shared island dialogue series, which will run throughout the year.<\/p>  <p>  As everyone said, there is a welcome opportunity for greater in-person engagement in the dialogue series.  We envisage that happening regionally too.  The dialogue series issue is engaging with sectoral issues and how we deepen mutually beneficial co-operation on the island.  There were two examples, with tourism and sport being addressed tomorrow.  Wider societal concerns for the future of the island include culture and identity issues, and how we can better understand each other across diverse communities and traditions.  In response to very welcome interest, members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the relevant committee chairs and party spokespersons in both the Oireachtas and Northern Ireland Assembly are being invited to shared island dialogue events this year.  I think that might deal with what Deputy Durkan said about the politics of it.  I had this debate with Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in respect of citizens' assemblies.  It is my view that the dialogue series is the important way to go.

She has made a big impact and has been here for only a few days.  We look forward to working with her on so many files, from Northern Ireland to Russia-Ukraine to transatlantic relationships and so much more besides.<\/p>  <p>  I am very glad to have this opportunity to discuss this important and very sensitive issue.  As I said in our debate earlier this month, the legacy of conflict and the past on this island and how we confront and address this chapter of our often troubled and painful history is vital to the shared future we want to see.  Even since that debate, we have seen another important and extensive report published by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  This is the second of two major reports that have examined specific events in the period of the Troubles and serious concerns that were held about the conduct of the RUC at the time.  This work by the office of the Police Ombudsman has shone an absolutely necessary light into aspects of the conflict in Northern Ireland and deserves serious consideration in this House.  It is a testament to the concern felt across this island that we gather here again to discuss these reports.  I wish to make it clear that fully addressing the painful legacy of the past, for every family who has waited far too long and for society as a whole, remains our priority and consistent focus.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 February the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published her findings following Operation Achilles, which examined the conduct of the RUC in respect of loyalist paramilitary attacks in south Belfast throughout the 1990s that resulted in 11 murders and one attempted murder.  That report was published one month after her report into Operation Greenwich, which investigated the RUC's handling of paramilitary attacks by the UDA-UFF between 1989 and 1993.  Nineteen lives were taken in those attacks and there were many more attempted murders.  The findings of both reports are shocking, while validating many of the concerns voiced by the families involved over very many years.  Both reports identified significant investigative and intelligence failures and a range of what are called \"collusive behaviours\" on the part of the RUC.  They identified continued unjustifiable use of informants by Special Branch - informants involved in serious criminality, including murder.  They identified the destruction of records, failures on the part of police to exploit all evidential opportunities and failure to warn individuals of threats to their lives.  It is important to note that the Police Ombudsman found no evidence to suggest that the police had intelligence that could have prevented any of these attacks or evidence that informants were protected from arrest and conviction.  That does not diminish, however, the significance of the failings identified in these reports and the vindication of families' legitimate and justified concerns.<\/p>  <p>  My thoughts, and no doubt those of all of us here today, are with the families, victims and survivors impacted by the attacks examined in these reports.  Even after decades of campaigning to know the truth, the publication of such reports can be very difficult and, I am sure, an emotional experience for the families involved, and perhaps for some in this House who may know the families well.<\/p>  <p>  These reports also serve to underline the importance of the work of the Police Ombudsman, set up as part of the transformative process of policing reform in Northern Ireland.  That reform process was driven forward by the Patten commission and underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement commitment to a \"new beginning to policing\" in Northern Ireland.  It is only through this kind of rigorous and unflinching examination of the past and through addressing issues that are brought to light that people can have trust in the systems of policing and law into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The survivors of the events examined by these reports and the families of those whose loved ones were lost have had to campaign tirelessly to get to this point and for access to truth and information.  Unfortunately, their long and difficult journeys are mirrored in the experiences of so many other families.  As I stated here a number of weeks ago, and as I have said many times in this Chamber and beyond, every bereaved family must have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice and truth, whether their loved one was killed by a paramilitary or a state actor and regardless of the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  When we come together in this House to debate and discuss the legacy of the conflict on this island and, sometimes, to express our frustration or shock at what happened and how it happened, we must above all remember the people and the families who are still impacted to this day by many of those horrific events.  Whether we are discussing the victims of Bloody Sunday, Kingsmill, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the Birmingham or Omagh bombings, the Sean Graham bookmakers' attack or other incidents covered in these reports, we owe those families - every family - more than simply our outrage.  We owe them our support and our determined efforts to make progress in establishing a genuine process of truth and justice for their loved ones.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing the legacy of the past is complex and sensitive.  It is a challenge that requires the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland to work together, to build sufficient consensus and to map out a path forward that everybody can support.  This is why the Stormont House Agreement, agreed in 2014 after a long and difficult period of negotiation, was a pivotal moment in the peace process on this island.<\/p>  <p>That agreement addressed, among other issues, the legacy of the past.  In doing so, it was guided by a number of fundamental principles.  These were that the legacy of the past must be addressed in a way that promotes reconciliation, upholds the rule of law, facilitates the pursuit of justice and information recovery, is human-rights compliant, balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable, and acknowledges and addresses the suffering of victims and survivors.<\/p> <p> The Stormont House Agreement created a series of bodies tasked with addressing the past.  These include an historical investigations unit to take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths, with prosecutions where possible, and to produce family reports.  It proposed an independent commissioner for information retrieval, ICIR, to operate on an all-island basis and enable victims' families to seek and receive information from former paramilitary groups or the Governments about the circumstances of the death of their loved ones.  In 2015, the two Governments concluded a treaty on the ICIR.  It included an oral history archive to share experiences and narratives related to the troubles of the past.  It also included an implementation and reconciliation group to oversee the process and report on themes drawn from the work of those bodies.<\/p> <p> The Stormont House Agreement will not bring those who lost their lives back nor can it fully heal the wounds of those injured.  No agreement could.  However, it can at least offer the hope of justice, truth and, in time, reconciliation.  That is why it is so regrettable that the comprehensive and balanced framework we agreed together has yet to be put in place.<\/p> <p> Last year the British Government published a policy paper that represented a radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement.  This command paper proposed a statute of limitations that would see an end to criminal investigations and prosecutions for Troubles-related offences pre-1998 as well as ending inquests and civil litigation.  It is essentially a proposal for an unconditional amnesty for those not yet convicted.  The British Government proposals have caused deep upset and concern to victims and survivors, who are understandably shocked by the idea that the avenue to justice open to all other victims of crime would be closed off to them forever by law.<\/p> <p> At the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held in June last year, I agreed with the Secretary of State to begin a period of intensive engagement so the political parties in Northern Ireland and the voices of victims could be centrally heard in finding a way forward.  That process ran through the summer and early autumn, engaging with a wide range of victims' organisations, civil society, academics and those working to deliver the current legacy investigations.  It was abundantly clear throughout that process that the British proposal for the statute of limitations does not have the support of victims.  It does not have the support of parties in Northern Ireland, who have been strong and unanimous in their opposition.  It has caused grave concern to international human rights bodies.  It is without international precedent.<\/p> <p> As I have stated here many times and communicated in clear terms to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, we cannot accept these proposals as a basis for a way forward.  We cannot countenance a situation in which families do not have access to a process of basic justice or are left once again to fight through the courts for years to challenge a government-imposed process.  We will continue to caution the British Government strongly against unilaterally legislating on these issues and to reinforce our consistent position that it is only through a collective approach that we can hope to deal with legacy issues comprehensively and fairly.<\/p> <p> The current system is not working for victims.  It is under-resourced and results in piecemeal progress and unconscionable delays and obstacles for families.  We see important breakthroughs and significant moments, like the publication of the Police Ombudsman's reports this month or the powerful findings of the Ballymurphy inquest, that bring moments of clarity and truth.  However, the important ongoing efforts are uneven and inadequate to the scale of the task.  While making clear to the British Government that we cannot and will not support an amnesty, we have remained open and ready to engage seriously with it and others to find a way forward.  Unilateral action cannot work.  It never works, in truth, when it comes to Northern Ireland.  We know from decades of experience what is possible when we try to work in partnership.  Our commitment to peace in Northern Ireland has been guided by an intention to ensure the next generation inherits a better, more prosperous and more peaceful society.  We must continue to do everything we can to deliver on that commitment and ensure new generations do not carry the burdens and scars of conflict into the future.<\/p> <p> In my role as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have met with many victims and survivors.  I am always struck by the tremendous dignity and determination with which they take forward their campaigns for truth and justice.  Last month, I met with a cross-community group, the truth and justice movement, and heard about their experiences, including that of Raymond McCord on the killing of his son by the UVF in 1997 and John Teggart on the killing of his father Daniel in Ballymurphy in 1972.  Paula Rainey told me about the killing of her father, Sgt. Joseph Campbell, a father of eight children at the time of his murder.  Eugene Reavey told me of the gun attack which took the lives of three of his brothers and four members of the O'Dowd family in 1976.  I could list many more names, each with a story so powerful it makes it inconceivable that any government could seek to legislate unilaterally to draw a line under that story or their efforts to find what truth and justice may still be possible.<\/p> <p> It is important to say I have met families who have challenged us in this State to do more to facilitate justice and truth recovery for cases where it is known or suspected that there was a significant cross-Border dimension to the crimes concerned.  It is essential we recognise and respond to that challenge and that we as a Government and a State play our part fully in a collective approach that works for victims in all jurisdictions.  It is vital we put in place a framework across both jurisdictions and that both Governments uphold our fundamental human rights commitments.  I am committed to doing that.<\/p> <p> The European Convention on Human Rights, which is central to the Good Friday Agreement and is incorporated into Northern Ireland law, must be respected fully in the legacy process.  Where governments do not live up to those obligations, it is open to families to challenge them.  The legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and a group of cases, including that of Pat Finucane, will once again be considered by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in early March.  The Government will continue to give its support to the families involved.  We will again call on the UK Government to fulfil its Article 2 obligations in each of those cases and, more broadly, through the introduction of an agreed and comprehensive legacy framework that puts legitimate needs of victims at its centre.<\/p> <p> I know Deputies will have much to add to this debate and many in this House care passionately about the need to fully address the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland.  Many wish to speak to the findings of the Police Ombudsman's report and express their serious concerns and solidarity for families involved.  Few of us are untouched by the history of the conflict on this island and we share across all parties a commitment to building deeper societal reconciliation based on fundamental principles of justice, fairness and the rule of law.  I look forward to hearing these important contributions and to responding at the end of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300033#MM00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645626120,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I understand Deputies McDonald, Brady and Mac Lochlainn are sharing their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300034#NN00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1645626720,"counter":478,"content":"<p>The footprints of collusion that track across Britain's dirty war in Ireland chart a shameful trail of state murder.  It was directed and co-ordinated at the highest levels of the British system, in alliance with loyalist death squads, and targeted the nationalist community, Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, human rights activists and, indeed, the fledgling peace process itself.  The series of reports published by the Police Ombudsman illuminate in horrific detail what has been known for decades.  Collusion was no illusion.  It was the lived reality for the nationalist community and, for so many, collusion was the route to their murder at the hands of the British state.<\/p><p>The Police Ombudsman's report into 27 loyalist murders and attempted murders in south Belfast between 1990 and 1998 is truly shocking.  It includes the mass shooting at the Sean Graham bookmakers on the Ormeau Road in February 1992, when five men and boys were shot dead by the UFF.  The report shows that British state agents and members of the RUC colluded with the UFF in the murder of these innocent civilians.  The depth and callousness of the collusion involved is revealed by the fact that these were agents who were up to their necks in the violent targeting of nationalists.  They were on the books and clearly identifiable in multiple murderers.  In return for their cruel deeds, they were shielded by the British system that directed and orchestrated their actions.  As Mark Sykes, a survivor of the Ormeau Road massacre puts it:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThey were merely a protected species as information about their involvement in killings was not shared with investigating officers and information regarding their involvement was routinely destroyed. <\/blockquote>  <p>Collusion was a structured, organised process that orbited the eventual act of murder.  At the centre sat the British state every single time.  I refer to the cover-ups, the destruction of evidence, the provision of weapons by the RUC to loyalist groups, the failure by the RUC special branch to alert targets that they were in danger and the failure to test alibis, to conduct forensic analysis and to protect eyewitnesses.  No stone was left unturned to ensure there would be no truth, no accountability and no justice.  This report is the latest in a series that has put the travesty of British collusion under a bright spotlight.  It follows the Police Ombudsman's damning investigation into Operation Greenwich, which detailed British state collusion in 19 murders and two attempted murders of Irish citizens by the British state.  The threads of British injustice in Ireland run deep and wrap around the legacy of conflict.  It shows that the British state purposefully targeted members of the nationalist community for murder.  Collusion was the method used to keep the hands of the powerful clear and hidden.<\/p><p>On Saturday, I stood on the streets of Ballymurphy in west Belfast.  Those are the same streets where in 1971 the parachute regiment, the outfit of Bloody Sunday infamy, shot dead ten innocent civilians.  The families of the victims showed me the spots where their loved ones were killed.  They too have faced decades of cover-up, black propaganda and concerted efforts on the part of the British state to deny and dodge responsibility for the murderous actions of its soldiers in Ballymurphy.  For the Ballymurphy and Bloody Sunday families, and for all the loved ones of those whose murders are detailed in the Police Ombudsman's reports, there have been years of hurt, pain and searing anger.  There have been years of sleepless nights, chorused by that dull thudding sound that only such injustice can summon.  Now, in the face of injustice after injustice, the British Government seeks an amnesty for those who carried out murder on its behalf.  Shame on it.<\/p><p>Britain can have no hiding place from the deliberate, calculated policy of arming, directing and controlling death squads in Ireland.  There is no support for its proposed amnesty here or internationally, and we stand with the families crying out for justice.  This Oireachtas must stand as one and foursquare in support of that demand.  The Taoiseach has repeated his opposition to the amnesty, as has the Minister this afternoon.  However, it is now imperative that we see real effort by the Irish State and the Irish Government to put persistent pressure on the British Government to drop its shameful amnesty legislation and to return to the legacy mechanisms as agreed at Stormont House.  It is through these agreed mechanisms that we can best address the legacy of conflict in Ireland and, together, meet the need for truth, justice and, yes, reconciliation too.  <\/p><p>We can build a better future for everyone who calls Ireland home.  I refer to a new Ireland, in which the potential of our people can be realised and where discrimination, prejudice and hate are replaced with hope, friendship and togetherness, and an Ireland where the dark days of the past are never repeated and never relived.  How we deal with the legacy of the past, however, is fundamental to building that future.  Boris Johnson and his Government cannot ignore their responsibilities.  They cannot be allowed to ride roughshod over the opportunity of all our communities to see that future I have referred to made real.  We have seen that happen far too many times.  Therefore, it is now the responsibility of the Irish Government to ensure that the British Government understands this and understands that this will not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300035#OO00100","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1645626720,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Let me begin by removing any ambiguity that may surround the phrase \"collusive behaviour\", as applied by the Police Ombudsman in the North, Marie Anderson, regarding her report on the relationship between the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries.  Evidence of collusive behaviour is evidence of collusion.  Collusion is evidenced throughout the pages of Ms Anderson's report, which details instance after instance where the security forces of the British Government engaged in a concerted campaign of murder against the very citizens it purported to govern.  It was a campaign which has imprinted the names of Sean Graham's bookies, Greysteel and Castlerock, to name but a few, onto the atlas of tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  It may be argued, however, that the term \"collusion\" is itself misleading.  It suggests that the main protagonists were in some way merely aided and abetted by a third party.  There is ample evidence, sitting alongside glaring patterns of historical continuity, which reveal a situation where loyalist murder gangs were provided with leadership and direction by uniformed agents of the British Government.  This is the crux of the matter.  The loyalist murder gangs were not just given assistance; they were led and directed by the security forces of the British Government in pursuit of the strategic objectives of the various arms of the British state.  Members of the RUC and, in particular, the RUC special branch employed loyalist murder gangs as a tactical instrument against the nationalist community in an attempt to derail the peace process.  <\/p>  <p>  A whole chapter, or perhaps, more accurately, a whole book, is absent here on the record of British military intelligence and MI5 in Britain's dirty war in Ireland.  Lest we forget, during a period when suspects were being routinely abused and tortured in Castlereagh interrogation centre, the British intelligence services had secretly bugged all the interrogation rooms there at that time.  This was only discovered by RUC interrogators during a torture session.  In the process of repeatedly throwing a suspect against a wall, they managed to dislodge some of the wall tiles and reveal sophisticated listening devices hidden underneath.  A subsequent search by the RUC of other rooms found additional bugging devices.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this British intelligence operation was multifold.  It was intended to identify suspects who had broken under interrogation and agreed to work as informers for RUC special branch and then to allow the intelligence services to intercede through their own devices and to intimidate those informers into also working for them.  This led to the situation where informers were actively working for the RUC special branch and, simultaneously, for British intelligence.  It also led to the compromising of members of the RUC, who were guilty of torturing and abusing suspects during interrogations, into becoming more amenable to direction by British intelligence.  In some instances, these members directly served the agenda of British intelligence for fear of prosecution for human rights abuses.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear here that in the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a significant element within the RUC special branch which was prepared to settle for nothing less than the military defeat of the IRA.<\/p> <p>The fledgling peace process, which the republican leadership was attempting to develop, represented a threat to the obsession of the RUC special branch with its war against the IRA.  The solution the RUC special branch sought was to recruit agents from the ranks of the British armed forces and to place them within loyalist paramilitary organisations, where their military training and the assistance offered to them by their masters in both the special branch and British intelligence, brought a whole new level of operational efficiency and direction to the activities of loyalist murder gangs.<\/p> <p> At this stage, having positioned their agents where they wanted, they then proceeded to arm them from a variety of sources, including a vast arsenal of weapons provided to loyalists by a former member of the British army working as a high-ranking agent for British intelligence, who imported the weapons from the apartheid state of South Africa.  These were weapons that have been linked to close to 100 murders in the North.  Many other weapons were sourced directly from serving members of the RUC and the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR, such as weapons reported lost or stolen, including the personal weapons of members of the RUC who refused to co-operate with the ombudsman's investigation.  They were weapons that were used in more than 100 additional murders by loyalists during this period.  In some instances, there were situations where weapons were discovered during police searches only to be handed back to loyalists by the RUC to be used again in subsequent murders.<\/p> <p> Having placed their agents within the murder gangs and having provided them with automatic weapons, the RUC special branch and British intelligence used their agents as a conduit to provide the murder gangs with RUC and British army intelligence and training to develop sophisticated intelligence databases on targeted members of the nationalist community.

Person K was clearly a mass murderer.  He was a key suspect in 17 murders and seven attempted murders.  The report of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland states that in 2016 the senior investigating officer for Operation Greenwich passed on a file about Person K to the PSNI.  Six years on, we are not aware of where that investigation sits.  This is a person who literally had a licence to kill, including the murder of Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Eddie Fullerton, in Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I want to talk about \"Person J\".  Person J, who is also covered in this report, was a serving member of the UDR when he was a key suspect in the murder of Gerard Casey in 1989.  In early 1991, the RUC found documentation on large numbers of republicans in the home of Person J.  He was released on bail shortly after that.  During the time he was on bail, he was a key suspect in two murders, that of Councillor Eddie Fullerton and Tommy Donaghy, who was a member of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Person J was also closely associated with the persons suspected of murdering Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Bernard O'Hagan.  This includes two Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in the period of mid-1991, Eddie Fullerton in May 1991 and Bernard O'Hagan in September 1991, and Tommy Donaghy, a Sinn F&eacute;in member, in August 1991.  He was on bail and a former UDR member at that stage.  He resigned from the UDR in late 1990.  This is all contained in the report.  We understand he was eventually sentenced to a year in prison.  The judge, apparently, was not presented with any evidence that Person J was connected to loyalist paramilitaries, even though he was a key suspect in the 1989 murder of Gerard Casey and was well known to be closely associated with leading loyalists at that time.  Months after he was released from prison, he was a key suspect in two further murders.<\/p>  <p>  That is just one shocking episode in addition to Person K.  I urge the Minister to look at both cases and to pursue this matter vigorously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300036#PP00400","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1645627320,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Before I start, I extend my sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of the Democratic Unionist Party MLA, Christopher Stalford, who died suddenly at the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il is once again addressing one of the most poisonous legacies of the Troubles, the historic allegations of collusion in the commission of criminal acts and, as we have already heard, including murder, collusion between state security forces and paramilitaries.  This comes with the publication of the report by the police ombudsman into investigative and intelligence failures and collusive behaviours by the RUC in regard to a series of murders and attempted murders by the UDA and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, UFF, in Belfast in the 1990s.  This covers eight loyalist attacks including the Sean Graham bookmakers' massacre where five people were killed.  It is deeply concerning that RUC files relating to that attack were deliberately destroyed.  In effect, the actions of the RUC prevented the proper investigation of these murders, while protecting their informants over innocent people.  It makes for uncomfortable and depressing reading.  That is why one of the most important and continuing successes of the peace process has been the return to relatively normal policing.  By normal policing I mean policing by consent.  When policing is by consent, the policing service and the community can work together to prevent crime from being committed, to bring offenders to justice and to improve the overall quality of everybody's lives.<\/p>  <p>  The Patten report and its recommendations were a groundbreaking re-evaluation of what is needed in policing in the community of Northern Ireland.  I repeat my long-held view, which I have said for the best part of two decades, that we in this jurisdiction still have a great deal to do in implementing the key Patten message that community policing must be at the core of every police service and the core function of every police officer.  However, the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain haunted by their legacy issues.  On both sides of the Border, the perceived need for an uncompromising response to terrorism led, in some instances, to the abandonment of proper controls and oversight of policing.  As long as legacy issues continue to fester, they prevent fully normalised policing.  The ombudsman report highlights the challenges we face.  Community policing requires active partnerships between the police and the community.  It requires accountability.  It requires transparency and trust.  Historic claims of law breaking by those given the task of enforcing the law are entirely destructive of this vital trust.<\/p>  <p>  Our attention is rightly focused now on the British Government's proposal for a legislative amnesty.  We all know that this is driven by the demands of Prime Minister Johnson's Tory backbenchers, not by the people of Northern Ireland and, uniquely, it has united all political parties on this island, North and South, against these proposals.  I had the privilege of attending, on behalf of the Labour Party, a meeting in Belfast City Hall.  It was the first time in my political career where every political party, including the Democratic Unionist Party, was united in common cause against the amnesty proposals.  We know in many cases, if not most, evidence will have degraded, memories will have deteriorated and witnesses will have died.  For example, there is no forensic record of any of the decommissioned weapons.  We know the sheer volume of cases, which amount to some 1,700 killings alone, is really challenging.  Uncovering the truth will only grow more difficult with the passage of time.<\/p> <p>There must be some future successful prosecutions.  We must allow that to be provided for, not shut off.  However, we must also recognise that every inconclusive investigation and every decision not to prosecute represents a failure and a real hurt for those people directly involved.  Northern Ireland's former Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory, has highlighted the difficulty in attempting through the justice system alone to deal with a quarter of a century of violent conflict which itself ended nearly a quarter of a century ago.  He has written that the criminal justice system is neither designed for nor capable of delivering meaningful information to the bereaved or indeed to society as to how and why people died.<\/p> <p> As I said, I joined the cross-party gathering of Deputies and Senators along with members of all parties in Northern Ireland last August to meet with a cross-community group of victims and campaigners to make our views clear to the UK Government.  Many of those people visited Leinster House last week, when I had the privilege again to meet with them as did the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  What is needed now and must be a priority after the Assembly elections is for the current UK Government approach to be abandoned and for an alternative to be spelled out to secure the fullest co-operation of both Governments, here and in the UK, to provide whatever mechanisms we can to give truth to people who simply want to know what happened.  When state agencies are surrounded by rumour and suspicion, the truth must come out.  There is no other way to maintain the integrity of public institutions.  At issue here is an ongoing crisis of public confidence.  Not just victims and their families but the public as a whole must be given the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300036#PP00500","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645627920,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Patrick Costello.  I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to another important and poignant discussion on the deep, dark legacy issues that beset all of us on this island regardless of political tradition, geography, age or demographic status.  The more we discuss these issues, the more clear, evident and important it becomes that we ensure that full justice is always delivered to all victims of a really dark period in our shared history, a shared and painful past that deserves not just justice but truth.  It also requires full buy-in from all entities, however.  As has been said by numerous speakers, there is broad agreement across this island that there can be no amnesty and that we cannot simply forget or disappear the past or the very many things that are still outstanding.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Police Ombudsman's report is absolutely damning.  It is damning of the collusion, the failings of investigation and the outright actions that led to murder and attempted murder of civilians in Northern Ireland at a very difficult time in the Troubles, in the early 1990s.  These events are relatively recent, within living memory for many of us.  Many of the families are still alive and seeking justice and still no doubt go to bed every night pained by the memories of that time.  Responsibility lies on all of us in this House, particularly the Government, which is why I welcome the opening remarks by the Minister and his continuing efforts with his colleagues to ensure that the terms of the Good Friday Agreement are fully met by all signatories, namely the Irish Government, the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland.  The British Government over the last number of years has been failing to meet the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Therefore it lies within the responsibility of this Government as a co-guarantor to ensure those obligations are met.  It is clear that justice and truth are still outstanding.  Any efforts to introduce an amnesty will be a slap in the face to the families of those victims and so many other families across this island and indeed in Great Britain who suffered during this extremely dark period.  <\/p>  <p>  I think of the five people who were murdered at Sean Graham bookmakers, other murders and attempted murders and the eight attacks in all that still are outstanding and have not seen true justice delivered.  The level of collusion between state and non-state actors and the ability for so many individuals to engage in truly dirty war activities are a stain on our recent conscience.  They are a stain that must be tended to through genuine engagement and genuine attempts at reconciliation.<\/p>  <p>  As important as it is to ensure that justice is delivered for the families of those slain at the Sean Graham bookmakers, we must also remember other victims.  We remember the families of the disappeared.  We repeat the call to those who know, and there are certainly people on this island who know where the bodies of Columba McVeigh and Jean McConville are, to ensure that those bodies can be returned to their families for a respectful and Christian burial.  Because we do not believe in amnesties for everyone, we do not believe in amnesties for anyone.  We believe in justice, truth and reconciliation for all.  There is no point just talking about one set of victims.  This Police Ombudsman's report is damning and refers to certain occasions that require deep analysis, investigation and full engagement by the British state, British state actors and those in Northern Ireland who were around at the time to establish what level of truth and justice can be delivered.  We have to make sure that the quest for truth and justice is based on equality.<\/p>  <p>  I am not going to go on for much longer because I want to give way to my colleague, Deputy Costello.  I hope we can continue to have these discussions in this Chamber.  While others do not particularly want to talk about these topics and are prepared to pretend they did not happen or just to move on, we all know there are so many families on this island that simply cannot move on.  The more we talk about it and call for justice, the more we will lend our support to the continuing efforts of the Minister, the Government and all parties in this House to ensure justice is delivered for all peoples who suffered during the Troubles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300037#QQ00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1645627920,"counter":487,"content":"<p>These recent reports by the Police Ombudsman are very important.  They tell us again how the search for truth and justice still eludes us and indicate the efforts required to establish the truth so there can be justice and, from justice, healing.  Many of the Deputies today and the Minister have rightly spoken against the British Government's proposed amnesty.  It is not about truth or justice and it will not bring healing, despite what the British Government may claim.  For all of us to stand full-throated against it is very important and certainly that is what all of us have done.  Many references have been made to Ray McCord and his work in challenging this.  As Deputy Howlin said, the proposed amnesty really has brought together more people in opposition to it than the Good Friday Agreement brought together.  It is quite an achievement by the British Government to bring us all together against it so quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I am struck by one of the things Deputy Richmond said about buy-in from all entities.  That is very important.  An entity I feel needs to do more buying in is the Irish Government itself.  I have spoken here before about the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, ICIR, which the Minister mentioned in his introductory remarks.  There is a treaty there providing for how it will work.  There is a structure there.  It needs legislation behind it.  The important thing that we could be doing is publishing our legislation on how the ICIR will work in this jurisdiction.  This would show the British Government that regardless of its attempts to bury the truth, we are moving on with attempts to uncover the truth and with what we agreed to do.  That is something the British Government seems to be struggling to do.  Publishing the legislation on the ICIR and beginning pre-legislative scrutiny would allow us to have these conversations, to continue raising this topic, to show leadership and to continue pushing the British Government backwards on this.  Not only should we be supportive of the Good Friday Agreement, Stormont House and the new approach; we also need to be taking action.  Pushing the ICIR from our side is one very important thing we can do.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing I would highlight is an example of a historical investigations unit.  This has been very successful in Northern Ireland.  There are many questions from the unionist and loyalist communities about the Irish Government's roles.<\/p> <p>Our setting up of an independent investigation unit to examine these kinds of matters could be very important.  Again, it would show leadership and that we are not afraid of the truth.  It would help to provide truth, justice and, ultimately, healing for the families and victims.<\/p> <p> This morning I found myself thinking about the letter allegedly sent by the UVF to Mr. Charles Haughey.  It was sitting in the National Archives for 30 years.  It contained allegations of collusion and a statement by the UVF to the effect that the British Government was using its force for X, Y, and Z.  What else is sitting in the archives that has not yet been released?  An historical investigations unit that has the power to examine the archives and piece things together would be incredibly important.  It could operate outside the ICIR.  These are two things the Irish Government can do to start playing its part in helping to let the light in, blowing the dust off the archives and helping to uncover the truth.<\/p> <p> We need to continue to stand unanimously in this Chamber against the British Government's proposals because, if pushed to their logical conclusion, they will render anything we do very difficult and, perhaps, moot.  We need to stand together against the British Government's attempts to bury the truth.  We need to do more to uncover the truth in Northern Ireland but we also need buy-in from all entities, including the Irish Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300037#QQ00300","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645628520,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Two recent reports by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland into loyalist murders and attempted murders in the north west between 1989 and 1994 and south Belfast between 1990 and 1998 shed light on the activities of British state agents and their involvement in and connection to numerous murders and attempted murders.  These are just the latest reports setting out the nature of the relationship between the British state and loyalist paramilitary gangs, a relationship that nationalist and republican communities were told for years did not exist.  They were told it was just republican propaganda.  These investigations identified, based on all the available evidence and information, that there was collusive behaviour and activity involving intelligence and surveillance; a failure to warn and conduct threat assessments in respect of threats to life; the failure to retain records and the deliberate destruction of files, especially those relating to informants that the police suspected of serious criminality, including murder; the failure to maintain records about the deactivation of weapons, which the Police Ombudsman described as indicative of a desire to avoid accountability; the failure of police to adequately address UDR officers passing information to loyalist paramilitaries; an absence of control and oversight in the recruitment and management of informants; and the passive turning of a blind eye to informants suspected of being involved in serious criminality, including murder, and the continued use of those informants when it was known that they were involved in those activities.<\/p>  <p>  Many loyalist killings, included in these two reports, were carried out with weapons that British state agents helped import and distribute to the UDA, UVF and Ulster Resistance.  Indeed, the previous Police Ombudsman, Dr. Maguire, established that individuals responsible for the importation and distribution of these weapons, which were later used in at least 80 murders, were never subject to police investigation.  His investigation also established that a number of these individuals were, or subsequently became, police informants.<\/p>  <p>  Britain can have no hiding place from the deliberate, calculated policy of arming, directing and controlling death squads in Ireland.  Therefore, I welcome the Irish Government's stated opposition to the amnesty sought by the British Government for its state forces, intelligence services and the agents who killed for them.  What are needed now, however, are genuine determination and effort by the Irish Government to put intensive and unrelenting pressure on the British Government to drop its shameful amnesty legislation and return to the legacy mechanisms, as agreed between the two Governments and the political parties as part of the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300038#RR00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1645628520,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Ms Marie Anderson said she is deeply concerned about the scale of the findings identified in her lengthy and complex investigation.

For roughly 25 years, the affected community had endured the British state's war against it.  It began in the late 1960s when communities across the North said they wanted civil and human rights and equality in their own place.  The only response of the British state to them was a violent one.  That was sustained for all the time in question and more.  That is what is really at the core of all this.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just my view and that of most nationalists and republicans that there was collusion; it is our absolute conviction that there was collusion because it is the lived experience of all those affected.  It is something they saw daily.  They watched the RUC and British Army come into areas, swamp them for a number of hours, set up checkpoints, search houses and then disappear very quickly.  Within minutes, the loyalist gangs would come in and carry out a murder or perhaps several murders.  Then, suddenly the state forces would come back in again.  This happened continuously on numerous occasions across the North throughout the years in question.  It is our view and that of the vast majority that at the very heart of the British war in Ireland was the fact that the British controlled, directed and armed the loyalist paramilitaries so they could carry out their work.  That is what they were doing.  They were part of the state.  The RUC, which was nothing more than a colonial militia, did exactly the same thing to assist them in respect of all that.  The Police Ombudsman's reports will present evidence of this for many, and others will have suspicions.  At the end of it all, we will need a process to deal with it all, but we have that process; we have the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement, which was the final attempt to come to an arrangement to deal with these legacy issues.  In fairness to the Minister, he said in his speech that we have mechanisms set up to deal with this.  Despite this, we find that the British Government, which is part of the same British establishment that organised and carried out the attacks and murders, is now saying it will not deal with legacy issues and instead have an amnesty for those who carried out the actions in question.  It is shameful and outrageous that this is happening on this island at this stage, in 2022.  It must end.  I appeal to the Minister to use all his influence, not just on the British Government but also on the American Administration, whose ambassador was here at the beginning of this debate, and on states across Europe to put pressure on Mr. Boris Johnson and his government to go down the path that was agreed in Stormont House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300038#RR00300","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1645628520,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak today.  I am very conscious as I do so that this is the second time in three weeks that we have met in this Chamber to discuss the legacy issues in Northern Ireland.  Three weeks ago, it was in the shadow of the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, and today it follows on from the Police Ombudsman's report into collusive behaviour, which we understand as collusion.<\/p><p>Often the work in this Chamber comes at us very fast and we must catch up as we go along.  In the past day or two, when I sat down to engage with what I would like to say today and examine some of the comments on the Police Ombudsman's report, I was struck by the words of a senior, unnamed PSNI officer who said the report made uncomfortable reading and apologised to the families.  I do not know who that officer was but the word &quot;uncomfortable&quot; really stood out.<\/p><p>Some of the findings of collusive behaviour identified in the report are: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIntelligence and surveillance failings which led to loyalist paramilitaries obtaining military grade weaponry in a 1987 arms importation; <br \/><br \/>A failure to warn two men of threats to their lives.<br \/><br \/>A failure to retain records and the deliberate destruction of files relating to the attack at Sean Graham Bookmakers;<br \/><br \/>The failure to maintain records about the deactivation of weapons &ndash; &quot;indicating a desire to avoid accountability for these sensitive and contentious activities&quot;;<br \/><br \/>The failure of police to exploit all evidential opportunities;<br \/><br \/>Failures by Special Branch to disseminate intelligence to murder investigation teams;<br \/><br \/>An absence of control and oversight in the recruitment and management of informants;<br \/><br \/>The continued, unjustifiable use by Special Branch of informant(s) involved in serious criminality, including murder and the passive 'turning a blind eye' to such activities. <\/blockquote>  <p>We can all accept that these are not only uncomfortable but also shocking and harrowing.  They should be called out.  The ramifications for the victims, survivors and their families go far beyond what we constitute as uncomfortable.<\/p><p>I was very conscious of the importance of the reports and the testimony of the families following the unveiling of the report two weeks ago.  The families of the victims welcome the Police Ombudsman's findings.  A statement by Relatives for Justice and KRW Law suggests families feel vindicated by Ms Anderson's conclusions.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe report finds that eleven murdered citizens and their families were systemically failed by the British state in life and in death.  It is a damning report that is undiluted evidence of the policy of collusion as it was practiced in South Belfast, and across the North. <\/blockquote>  <p>Truth is incredibly important.  I thought about truth as opposed to the word &quot;amnesty&quot;, as proposed by the British Government last year.  I believe it was our own President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, who talked about the ethics of memory.  Memory, legacy and truth all belong to the same family.<\/p> <p>There are absolutely no ethics in what the British Government is trying to do under the title of amnesty legislation.  This legislation is simply trying to draw a line and say that at this point, there will be no more truth or consequence and no justice for the families.  Across this Chamber, we are unified in our condemnation and opposition to that.  It is not something that we will play politics with.  Our opposition to that amnesty legislation will unite us on this island.  It is anathema to the idea of truth and justice.<\/p> <p> In the Minister's opening contribution he named some survivors he has been in contact with.  He mentioned Eugene Reavey.  Eugene became a friend of mine in the years before the pandemic struck, as did Stephen Travers.  Eugene and Stephen have a programme called the Truth and Reconciliation Platform.  I had never met them before, but they reached out to me and said that they wanted to take the Truth and Reconciliation Platform to DEIS schools in Dublin that I had previously been working in running leadership programmes.  They wanted to come in and talk to some of the students about their experiences.  It is an incredible experience to hear two people as honourable and with the integrity of Eugene and Stephen, and to hear about the cause for which they stand.  I want to touch on that a bit.  Their idea of truth and what they stand for really left an impression on me.  It is exactly what we are standing here for today in this Chamber.<\/p> <p> I stood in DEIS schools around Dublin with Eugene and Stephen.  Eugene has a strong Armagh accent and he talked to the kids about Armagh football.  Stephen has a much softer accent.  When Stephen walked in, I noted the remarkable difference in how he was received by the kids and the older school staff and secretaries, who remembered him from his days in the Miami Showband.  I had to explain to the students that in his day, Stephen was probably the equivalent of Justin Bieber.  Eugene and Stephen talked to the kids about really harrowing experiences.  Stephen spoke of the loss of his friends in the Miami Showband massacre and Eugene spoke of the loss of his brothers.  You could hear a pin drop in those rooms.  I asked them a number of times why they were doing this work and reliving the trauma almost every day of their lives.  They said they do it because the truth is important.  They told me that they are fighting to honour their family members and the victims, to stand in solidarity with survivors and to ensure that we never repeat the mistakes of the past.  That is what we need to remember.  That is why these reports are essential.  That is why we have to stand for truth.  That is why we must stand in opposition to the British Government's attempts to cast a blanket over this and deny us truth and justice.  It is in the memory of those who lost their lives - the 3,500 victims and the 40,000 people who were injured in the Troubles by whatever forces.  The dignity, the incredible power and the testimony of survivors is something that we must honour and herald every single day, whether it is in this Chamber or elsewhere.  We must do all that we can to ensure that it is never forgotten.  We must ensure that those accountable are brought to justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300038#RR00400","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645629120,"counter":493,"content":"<p>As well all know, on 14 July 2021 the British Government published a command paper outlining plans for legislation providing for a statute of limitations ending criminal investigations and prosecutions in respect of Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation.  One obvious intention of these proposals is to prohibit future prosecutions of military veterans and ex-paramilitaries for Troubles-related incidents.  This announcement has been rightly condemned, in the first instance by victims groups and their families, and also by the Irish Government, the political parties in Northern Ireland on both sides of the divide, by the Committee on the Administration of Justice in Northern Ireland, by several international human rights organisations, as the Minister has said, as well as UN Special Rapporteurs, Council of Europe commissioners for human rights and by Michael Posner, former US Assistant Secretary of State.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months we have been reminded of some of the appalling violence and tragedies which have taken place in Northern Ireland since 1969.  As we have heard, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Marie Anderson, published a 344-page report earlier this month in relation to a number of loyalist paramilitary murders in the 1990s, including the massacre at the Sean Graham bookmakers in February 1992.  As I have said in this House before, the report makes for shocking reading.  The ombudsman found that there was collusive behaviour between the RUC and the UDA-UFF in these cases.  The report also showed that the police gave weapons to these paramilitary organisations.  It outlined how records about loyalist informants were destroyed, and it highlighted how warnings were not passed on to those known to be under threat.  In January the Police Ombudsman issued another report into the RUC's handling of paramilitary attacks by the UDA-UFF between 1989 and 1993, which led to 19 murders and many attempted murders.  Yet again, the ombudsman identified collusive behaviour and brought forward major concerns about the conduct of the police.  The report examined the murder of Councillor Eddie Fullerton in County Donegal in May 1991, as well as the killing of four people in Castlerock in March 1993, and the gun attack which killed eight people in Greysteel in October 1993.  I recall meeting Councillor Eddie Fullerton in the late 1980s during my Seanad campaign.  I must say that he was very hospitable to me when I called to him.  His murder was quite shocking to me, as it was, no doubt, to his family and all those who knew him.  The January report makes for disturbing reading.  The ombudsman is to be commended on her work.  <\/p>  <p>  On 1 February, we had a debate to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.  On 30 January 1972, 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment soldiers opened fire on innocent civilians, killing 13 people.  As we know, the families of those who were murdered have campaigned for justice ever since and wanted the soldiers involved to be prosecuted.  This has not happened and the prosecution of soldier F has run into problems.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974 resulted in the greatest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.  It seems beyond doubt that in their efforts to defeat the Provisional IRA and to influence the political process, there was collusion between loyalist paramilitaries, the RUC and British military intelligence, or certainly between elements of those organisations in the case of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  This is totally unacceptable in a so-called democracy.  The surviving victims and the families of those who were killed on that day are entitled to get justice.  The Irish Government must continue to raise this issue with the British Government to get it to release the relevant files and documents in this regard, and to seek the truth about these events.<\/p>  <p>  The debate today should be all about their victims and their families.  I can only but imagine the daily upset and distress that these families experience as long as these issues remain unresolved.  Legacy issues and dealing with legacy matters continue to be major concerns for all those caught up in the violence that has plagued Northern Ireland since 1969.  Therefore, the provisions of the Stormont House framework on legacy that were agreed in 2014 must be fully implemented.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government must continue to press the British Government on this issue.  There are some signs that the British Government is reconsidering its stance on this matter, certainly in the short term anyway, as we head towards the Assembly elections.  I hope it will go all the way and abandon this ill-considered proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300039#SS00200","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1645629120,"counter":494,"content":"<p>This is a very important debate.  I listened carefully to all of the speakers so far.  I fully support the view as expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to what must happen now and what the future should be for all of us.  Earlier this month, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a very significant report assessing the RUC's handling of a series of loyalist paramilitary murders between 1990 and 1998.  This report clearly identified a range of collusive behaviours by the police and the continued unjustifiable use by special branch of informants involved in serious criminality, including murder.  It was known to special branch at the time that the people it was supporting were carrying out foul and unacceptable murders.  Our thoughts are with the families of the 11 people murdered in the eight loyalist attacks considered in this report, including the victims and survivors of the Sean Graham bookmakers attack, which saw its 30th anniversary recently.<\/p> <p>This is a substantial report and, of course, has to be studied.  The findings must be acted on.  I know the Government and all Members of the House are deeply conscious that this comes only weeks after the report of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland on Operation Greenwich which also identified collusive behaviours and raised significant concerns regarding appalling police conduct.<\/p> <p> All the families impacted by these reports and all the other families who lost loved ones during the Troubles deserve access to information and a process of justice for their loved ones, regardless of who were the perpetrators.  It is vital that we put in place a comprehensive and agreed framework to deal with this very painful legacy of our past.  Victims and families have been waiting far too long.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to British Government proposals to legislate for a general statute of limitations.  There absolutely cannot be unilateral action on any of these issues.  It is only by the agreement of all the parties concerned that we all go forward together.  I compare the current leadership in Britain with people such as Tony Blair and John Major, who, notwithstanding the political difficulties they had, made significant progress in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement.  We cannot allow actions such as the British proposal to legislate for a general statute of limitations to proceed.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  All Members on all sides of this House will play our part in making sure that what was planned in the Stormont House Agreement actually happens.<\/p> <p> I refer to the families who have lost loved ones.  In my most recent speech on this issue in the House, I referred to the disappeared - those people who were murdered and buried and whose bodies have not been found.  I think there were 16 in all.  I know that 12 of those bodies have been recovered.  Many of the people who murdered the four remaining victims are in their 60s, 70s or 80s.  It is incumbent on us all to make sure that, whatever people may be still living, everybody concerned, on all sides, encourages, supports and makes every possible effort at this very late stage to bring closure to all of those families.  Having spoken to the family of Columba McVeigh in particular, I am aware of the deep hurt they still suffer.  Of all the people who died in the Troubles and as a result of violence, these are the only four whose graves are not known.  I believe the families are absolutely entitled to the full support of everybody.  I have acknowledged that Sinn F&eacute;in in the past and, indeed, the IRA did find 12 of the 16 bodies but I repeat that we need to get those other four.<\/p> <p> It is a very difficult time right now because Northern Ireland is in the process of preparing for an election.  Listening to Sammy Wilson speaking about the group in Markethill, County Armagh, certainly made clear the difficulties people face on all sides.  Extreme views gain momentum coming up to elections.  We need to do anything we can do to support the middle ground, whether one is nationalist, unionist, or whatever one's beliefs are, if any.  As regards the Stormont House Agreement, the historical investigations unit, the independent commission on information retrieval and the oral history archive are key and core parts of that Agreement.  I believe that is the only way forward.  I support the Minister and the Government in their efforts to ensure that all of those components of the agreement are carried out and that we move on to a new phase in our country of continued peace and work and a new administration in the North that works together on the middle ground. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300039#SS00300","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645629720,"counter":496,"content":"<p>The report of the ombudsman into the south Belfast killings is grim.  It details 27 loyalist murders and attempted murders in south Belfast.  There were eight RUC special branch agents involved in 27 murders.  One agent was recruited because of his involvement in the planning, preparation and execution of previous murders.  There was collusion in each and every killing.  State agents involved in murder were allowed to kill and kill again.  RUC agents handed guns back out to loyalist paramilitaries so they could kill again.<\/p>  <p>  The report is grim.  It is shocking, disgraceful and appalling.  What it is not is that it is on its own.  There was the report on Operation Greenwich in respect of the killing of 19 people, including Councillors Eddie Fullerton and Bernard O'Hagan.  The investigation into the death of Pat Finucane is ongoing.  There were previously reports on loyalist killings in south Down and the north west, including Loughinisland, Greysteel and other incidents.  It can no longer be dismissed by anyone as a few rotten apples.  This was systemic.  It was a part of Britain's tools of war in the North; its tools of war in Ireland.  Of that there can now be no question.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that we are having these statements today because I regret this issue has not got the attention it ought to have received outside this Chamber or generally speaking.  The coverage it got in the British media was practically nil.  It was covered in the Irish media but, to be honest, I am not sure that coverage was to the depth and extent it should have been, given how shocking the findings were.   Our nearest neighbour, the state that governs the Six Counties in the North of our country, used loyalist paramilitaries as death squads to assassinate people on a very widespread basis.<\/p>  <p>  It seems clear now that the trail of this goes all the way to No.10.  It is important that it is now part of Government policy and communication that it is clear with the British Government that it does not accept the full truth has been told in respect of collusion because it has been clearly shown, including in this report, to be systemic and part of policy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300040#TT00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1645629720,"counter":497,"content":"<p>It is all very well to talk about this but at some point there will have to be action.  The Irish and British Governments need to take decisive action now.  There has been too much kicking the can down the road.  They cannot keep making new agreements and not delivering on them.  Both Governments are like the boys who cried wolf.  It has reached the stage where nobody trusts them.  The Government must look at the existing agreements and start delivering on them.  These agreements are the foundation stones for the peace that exists on this island, a very successful peace that has transformed this island in the past two decades.<\/p>  <p>  The past cannot be changed or undone.  The suffering and pain experienced in our society cannot be brushed aside or hidden away.  All sides, including the State, must make a positive contribution to acknowledging the past and working towards reconciliation and healing.  There are victims and survivors on all sides.  Many of them still live with the psychological and physical scars of the conflict.  Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges the grief associated with all the lives that were lost.  On all sides of the conflict, all victims deserve acknowledgement of their pain and loss as the first step towards a healing process.  The best way to achieve that is through the establishment of an independent international truth commission.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government wants to push through an amnesty for those who carried out acts of British state murder in Ireland, including those who were responsible for the atrocities of Bloody Sunday and Ballymurphy; those who murdered Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and Councillor Eddie Fullerton; those who carried out the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and the British soldiers who, in 1974, shot John Pat Cunningham in the back - a vulnerable adult with the mental age of a seven year old who ran from them in fear.  I have met families of victims.  They have spoken of being retraumatised by the British Government's attempt to hide its shameful acts.  It is time for the Government to start to show it is serious about peace, truth and the real reconciliation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300040#TT00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1645630320,"counter":498,"content":"<p>What we have here in black and white in the Police Ombudsman's report is the very significant evidence and confirmation of repeated collusion by the British state with loyalist paramilitaries in murdering people.  The point has been made that this is far more than a few bad apples.  It is or was clearly government policy.  It was systematic, deadly, has been covered up and continues to be covered up, and those responsible continue to have impunity.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth going through some of the cases, and many have been mentioned, to bring out the horror of this behaviour by a supposedly democratic state.  In particular, the report into 11 murders by loyalist gangs found there was police involvement and police inclusion.  It should also be mentioned, because people may think this is something that happened in the dim and distant past, which even so would obviously not make it okay, that we are talking about atrocities that go into the 1990s.  On the Sean Graham bookmakers killings, the Police Ombudsman found the police colluded in the massacre at the bookies in 1992 where five people were killed, including one 15-year-old.  The Police Ombudsman found the police deliberately destroyed files on this attack protecting those responsible.  In other cases, the RUC quite literally handed guns to loyalist terrorists, guns with which they went on to commit murder.  That is the definition of collusion.  This is a criminal conspiracy of state forces working hand in hand with terrorist gangs.  State-sponsored serial killers is what the former Police Ombudsman called some of the police agents in loyalist and republican groups.  Individuals were allowed to kill with impunity so long as they remained of use to the British state.<\/p>  <p>  One example from 1971 is the loyalist bombing of McGurk&rsquo;s bar, which killed 15 civilians and injured 17 more.  Years later, a member of the covert military reaction force admitted it had supplied the explosives and encouraged the attack, believing the bar to be a republican hotspot.<\/p>  <p>  In another case the Police Ombudsman highlighted the 1993 killing of Damien Walsh, a 17-year-old young man shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries.  The report found significant investigative failure by the police amounting to collusive behaviours.  It said Walsh's killers were provided with information by a police officer and British intelligence which informed their attack.  Damien&rsquo;s mother, Marian, had campaigned for nearly three decades, questioning the role of the police in her son&rsquo;s shooting.  The ombudsman&rsquo;s report found that police had also failed to capitalise on investigative opportunities, including failing to arrest suspects, and had made a deliberate decision to disregard intelligence about the threat.  In another case last year, a judge found that &ldquo;until late 1973, an understanding was in place between the RUC and the Army whereby the RUC did not arrest and question, or even take witness statements from, soldiers involved in shootings such as this one&rdquo;.  The judge added, &ldquo;This appalling practice was designed, at least in part, to protect soldiers from being prosecuted and in very large measure it succeeded.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Now the Prime Minister of Britain, Boris Johnson, wants to stop any more investigations such as this to stop more horrors being uncovered.  They are proposing to close down all investigations into the collusion between the British military and police forces and loyalist terrorist groups and are planning to end all inquests into killings that have been ordered by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland as well as all investigations by the Police Ombudsman, even those where grave and exceptional new evidence of police misconduct has emerged.  On top of that they are seeking to end all civil actions being pursued through the courts by families seeking disclosure from the Ministry of Defence and others on evidence of collusion between state forces and paramilitaries, as well as investigations being conducted by the legacy investigation branch of the Police Service of Northern Ireland which considers historical cases of killings.  This includes cases such as soldier F who has been charged with murders on Bloody Sunday in 1972 and the death of a man with mental disabilities killed by soldiers.  The UK Government proposals will leave families who may already have attended up to 30 preliminary hearings to be told the inquest itself cannot now go ahead.  This is a cover-up, plain and simple.<\/p>  <p>  I will finish with a reference to another cover-up, which are the attempts to protect General Mike Jackson from prosecution for his role in the Bloody Sunday massacre.  He was second in command of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment and would later climb up the ladder of the British Army to become the chief of staff at the time of the invasion of Iraq.  I was at a demonstration in Derry to mark the 50th anniversary of the murder of 14 people.  Immediately after the Bloody Sunday massacre, Jackson interviewed his soldiers and drew up a shot list of where the shootings had occurred.  It was a piece of fiction but it became the basis of the Report of the Tribunal appointed to inquire into the events on Sunday, 30th January 1972, the Widgery Report, which whitewashed the Parachute Regiment.  The mood of the protest I was at a couple of weeks ago was focused on the call for the prosecution of this man, General Sir Mike Jackson.  Not only did he help to organise the massacre but he was also the key figure in covering it up.  That is why he must be brought before the courts to answer for his crimes.<\/p>  <p>  There is an important political point here where the British establishment likes to portray the conflict in the North as a war between two tribes where their army becomes, supposedly, piggy in the middle.  Bloody Sunday arose because of a cold-blooded decision of the British establishment to suppress a mass movement for civil rights.  Correctly, everybody is agreed there must be no immunity given to the soldiers involved, but the real criminals are those who gave the orders to shoot.  Let us start by putting them in the dock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300041#UU00100","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1645630320,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I am glad we are having this debate again, having had one just a number of weeks ago following the commemoration of the awful atrocity in Derry on Bloody Sunday.  I am glad Deputy Gannon referred earlier to the work of people like Stephen Travers and Eugene Reavey.  In fact some Deputies and I had an opportunity earlier today to have a very long and detailed conversation with Stephen Travers.  I know both Stephen and Eugene over many years and I know they have drawn much of their inspiration from the work of Seamus Mallon and the leadership that he showed over the years in the great work they do in the whole area of speaking to groups and meeting with other families who were also victims.<\/p>  <p>  I know the late Seamus Mallon, an outstanding Irish nationalist, encouraged them to carry out their work.  I know my former D&aacute;il colleague and good friend Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon has been similarly supportive of the work of Eugene and Stephen.  It is very important we recognise the work of different individuals and groups.  Many of the groups throughout Northern Ireland, in particular, like the WAVE trauma group, are powerful advocates for victims and for advocating on behalf of people in regard to their particular needs.  Eugene and Stephen set up the Truth and Reconciliation Platform and have spoken to hundreds of people who have suffered similarly to themselves in many different forums.  They have found it very important that people have the opportunities to outline what they have been through and what they would like to see achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, most of them realise that in many instances people will not be brought to justice for the terrible tragedies inflicted on innocent people, but if the truth at least was arrived at, it would be so important.  One of the things they talk about is the need for our young people to know what went on in our country.  It is so disappointing when one hears of so many people today who do not study the subject of history at second level school.  Both history and geography are basic parameters for all of us in regard to what we need to know about her own region, country and our own backgrounds.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals published by the British Government last July for a statute of limitations - basically an amnesty - ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents as well as inquests and civil litigation have caused, very understandably, very significant distress, alarm and disquiet all across this island and in Britain as well.  It is an absolutely appalling proposal.<\/p> <p>The proposals represent a marked and fundamental departure from what the British Government agreed with the Irish Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland in the Stormont House Agreement.  That agreement was hard fought for and hard won.  It should be honoured and implemented.  It puts the parameters and structures in place to deal with legacy issues.<\/p> <p> More recently, the published reports by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland reveal absolutely shocking behaviour.  Those of us who read Anne Cadwallader's book on the activities of the Glenanne gang and others perhaps were not shocked by some of the findings, but they brought home with a clear focus the terrible atrocities that were facilitated by state forces.  The Police Ombudsman described collusive behaviour, collusion and, essentially, the use of agents and weapons, including the handing back of weapons to loyalist paramilitaries.  That was done by agents of a state.  It is deplorable behaviour.  There was mention earlier by colleagues here of the terrible atrocity in Sean Graham bookmakers and the terrible loss of life on that awful, tragic day.  The ombudsman's report has found very strong evidence of investigative intelligence failures and collusive behaviours by the then RUC, including the continued unjustifiable use of informants involved in serious criminality and murder.  Crucially, and again unacceptably, there was the return of weapons to loyalist paramilitaries.  I commend the ombudsman on producing this report.  It lays out in stark detail what people went through and what the type of behaviour was.<\/p> <p> We have often discussed in the committee, in bilateral meetings and on Question Time in the D&aacute;il the failure of the British Government to respond to the three unanimous requests of this Parliament for access to papers and files pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974.  It is deplorable that the British Government has not responded.  I spoke on a number of occasions over the past 12 months in this House about the bombing in Belturbet in 1972, when two young innocent people, Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley, were murdered.  I put information on the record of this House about 12 months ago whereby there is conclusive evidence that the bomb was brought across the Border from County Fermanagh, with a clear link with loyalist paramilitaries as well.  I again take the opportunity to commend the work of Professor Edward Burke of the University of Nottingham.  That gave us the material that I was glad to put on the record of the House, from the point of view of it being given to our agencies, the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to pursue.  We want to see the truth in respect of those desperate atrocities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300041#UU00300","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645630920,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I have a massive interest in history and I have always admired the work of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which has spent many decades tracking down Nazi war criminals.  It has done so with the support of many police forces throughout the world.  Indeed, the Home Office in Britain and the UK police forces have been very good to engage in that over the years and they have led the way in Europe in terms of seeking justice for victims of the Holocaust.  Victims of any war or of paramilitarism have every right until their dying day to seek justice for family members.  This is what is at the heart of everything we are discussing this afternoon.  The same applies in any jurisdiction.  People have the right to full justice for a family member or loved one who has died.<\/p>  <p>  To see Boris Johnson seek to introduce, on 14 July last, a statute of limitation ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to the period of the Troubles as well as inquests and civil litigation was absolutely deplorable.  It was denying people the right to justice, the right to information, the right to a judicial procedure and the right to an appeal procedure that I referred to.  It is a fundamental departure from the Stormont House Agreement.  The Irish State cannot accept this.  The Minister and the Government will have to reiterate this point to the British Government time and again, that this fundamental departure from the Stormont House Agreement will not be accepted by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Recently published reports by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland reveal shocking behaviour.  My colleague Deputy Brendan Smith has just referred to the handing back of weaponry to loyalist paramilitaries which was used again to target and kill innocents.  I also wish to mention the trial of the hooded men.  In 1971, 14 men were taken into custody in the North.  They were hooded and denied food, water and sleep.  White noise was played and they were tortured.  They did not see daylight for many days.  The UK Supreme Court ruling last December found that the PSNI decision to suspend that investigation case was unlawful.  I am surprised there has not been a high level of debate in this House yet, because there are some senior personnel still in the PSNI and some have transferred and now serve with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must have a lens of scrutiny on their roles in suspending that investigation.<\/p>  <p>  I joined my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith earlier today in meeting Stephen Travers of the Miami Showband.  It is well worthwhile to listen to him.  There have been many documentaries and a great deal written about him.  He has gone on an incredible journey, along with his family and friends, to try to get answers and justice.  However, that can only happen when the state and the arms of the state, including the police service, fall in behind it.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to go off on a tiny tangent, if the chairperson will allow me.  The necrology wall at Glasnevin Cemetery is very important.  I started by speaking about history.  It is very important we do not start whitewashing history and saying the events of the past were something good or positive.  Mr. Joe Duffy of RT&Eacute; fame was absolutely right to lead the way in having the innocent victims of 1916 all named on the wall of remembrance in Glasnevin Cemetery.  However, it should stop there.  There is no place on that wall for members of the Royal Irish Constabulary or members of the British armed forces whose existence in Ireland was not to push a bicycle down the village street and tell people to go home because it was closing time in the pub.  They were not here for that.  They were here from the get-go to suppress the Irish will for independence and freedom.  There is an absolute need to walk away from anything that tries to whitewash that a century later and bestow honour on them.<\/p>  <p>  I thought about telephoning Joe Duffy's show a week ago because the debate on the radio was extremely slanted.  I wish to state on the record that the innocent victims of 1916 and through to the Civil War period should be commemorated, as well as, indeed, the Irishmen who fought on both sides during the Civil War.  We need to move on.  However, we will not, as a nation, tip our cap time and again, have an imperial inferiority and say we will commemorate a force whose existence here was solely to subjugate the will of an independent Irish state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300042#VV00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1645630920,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Since January, the families of more than 30 Irish citizens have received reports from the Police Ombudsman in the North.  These reports detail actions by RUC officers and members of the British Army that range from the distribution of weapons, the provision of intelligence documents, the destruction of evidence, the deliberate failure to warn persons of a threat to life in the weeks before they or their loved ones were murdered, and the protection of agents involved in murder from investigation or prosecution to the contemporaneous criminal wrongdoing of state actors being known and actively covered up.  In any society this should cause a national emergency.  Unfortunately, it barely caused a ripple on the benches across from me and in this State.<\/p>  <p>  These reports are not just accounts of trauma and grief.  They also give rise to fundamental questions about British state involvement in murder.  The fallout equally spotlights the lack of British state accountability for crimes, the limits of the Office of the Police Ombudsman and the plight of victims and survivors across the community.  How can it be that we see decisions from inquest courts with routine findings of wrongful killing by members of the British Army in the case of the Ballymurphy massacre in 1971 and the killing of 14-year-old Francis Rowntree with a plastic bullet?  How can it be that the Police Ombudsman has now found state collusion or collusive behaviours in Mount Vernon, Loughinisland, the north west and south Belfast, yet the prospect of state accountability remains elusive or even contested?  All these victims were Irish citizens, yet these reports and findings continue to be treated with minimal interest, perfunctory statements and tea and sympathy.  Victims' rights are being routinely abused.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government must be more robust in its support of victims of the conflict and its calls for accountability for the policies and practices of collusion and British state violence, just as robust as it is in calling out harms by non-state actors.  The Minister should listen to the calls from the United States congressional hearings and victims' groups such as Relatives for Justice and establish an emergency summit on dealing with the past, where questions of victims' rights, human rights compliance and accountability are placed on the political agenda instead of treating these most grave matters as a routine matter of community relations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300042#VV00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1645631520,"counter":503,"content":"<p>There is general agreement that what the British Government is attempting to do in the amnesty legislation is to put everything under the carpet and not have to deal with the dirty war it fought in Ireland.  Let us be clear.  Partition was maintained through force.  There was a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people maintained by what was always a paramilitary police force in the RUC.  Obviously people would not lie down to this, and when they attempted to ask for their rights, they were beaten down by the state and eventually interned and shot.<\/p>  <p>  At one stage British Government policy was to use the British army.  It also used the likes of the MRF in the background.  Beyond this it was involved substantially in the creation of the UDA.  There was the whole idea of muddying the pool, and terror was operated and actioned on the nationalist community.  Beyond this, at times, it decided it needed to engage loyalists and put in its own agents or turn people into agents so they could control and direct.  This is what is shown in the two Police Ombudsman's reports on those 30 people who were killed.  A determination had been made in British policy that it was going to execute Irish citizens.  This is no different from what the Glenanne gang had done during the 1970s.  We had the likes of Seamus Ludlow killed by another gang.  Jack Rooney and Hugh Waters were killed by the Glenanne gang alongside 130 others.<\/p>  <p>  We have not done justice on the issue of collusion.  The fact is this was British Government policy.  It was the means by which it decided it would deal with republicans.  It tried to cow the entire nationalist community through killings.  We are talking about the likes of Loughinisland and Sean Graham bookmakers.  This State also has to look at its record.  I am speaking about Seamus Ludlow and the absolute failure to investigate.

The British state murdered citizens of that state and then covered up its actions to protect the perpetrators.  The information revealed in those documents is incredible.  On 5 February 1992, the UDA murdered five nationalists and wounded another nine in Sean Graham bookmaker's shop on the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast.  Two men wearing boiler suits and balaclavas pumped 44 shots into their victims.  The Police Ombudsman report into this atrocity also investigated the murders of seven other nationalists by RUC special branch informants at the time.  These murderers were under the direction and under the employment of the RUC and special branch.  Incredibly, the Police Ombudsman report identified eight British informants linked to the murders and attempted murders of 27 people.<\/p>  <p>  A police gun was used in the hands of loyalists.  The RUC deliberately destroyed files.  It failed to investigate CCTV footage.  It failed to search houses of suspects.  The RUC failed to conduct a full forensic test on blood.  It failed to test a getaway car for gunshot resin.  These events and those details in Operation Greenwich are simply part of continuing British Government policy in Ireland that includes Bloody Sunday, the Ballymurphy massacre, the Springhill massacre, Loughinisland, Greysteel, the Miami showband massacre and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I give credit to Stephen Travers, whom I had the honour of meeting today, for how he has campaigned for justice not only for himself but for many others.<\/p>  <p>  Incredibly, the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has 400 more requests for investigations by other families, victims and survivors.  There are 400 outstanding requests that have still to be processed by the Police Ombudsman in the North.  These families have been through so much.  Thirty or 40 years after the murders of their loved ones, they have had limited details being drip fed slowly by these reports.  They have been shockingly slow.  Still justice has not been delivered to them.  For many of these people what has been revealed in the report confirms what they already know.<\/p>  <p>  We know there is no British justice in Ireland.  There is no British rule of law in Ireland.  If there is a British amnesty, the perpetrators of these actions will simply get away with murder.  We must remember the British military involved in the killings were also involved in the killings of elected representatives such as Councillors Eddie Fullerton and Bernard O'Hagan.  They also killed a number of election workers.  Incredibly, the British state was threatening the democratic functions of this State at that time.  Why did these covert murders happen?  It was simply because of the international pushback against Britain after what happened on Bloody Sunday.  The British military knew it could not get away again with killing nationalists live on television.  It knew it would have to do it in a covert fashion and use loyalist proxies to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Some people may feel this is ancient history.  I heard people speak about the fact they are students of history.  This happened in our lifetime.  The Minister was a Deputy in the same decade that many of the murders in these files happened.  The perpetrators of these murderers live in the same towns and villages as the families of the dead loved ones.  Some of the securocrats involved in this collusion are still in the pay of the British state.  Many were promoted in their jobs.  We have a British paratrooper who was on the streets of Derry on Bloody Sunday who was given an MBE by the English Queen as a result of his work on Derry's streets.  This is the same queen who received a commendation from the Sinn F&eacute;in leader last week, which was incredible just 50 years after Bloody Sunday.<\/p>  <p>  Irish republicans, on the other hand, have spent cumulatively 100,000 years in prison.  Think about this.  Cumulatively, if we add up all of the sentences served by Irish republicans for their actions, it adds up to 100,000 years.  There is a massive contrast between the outcome for those actions and the outcome for those who perpetrated murder on behalf of the British state.  I cannot think of another western country that would have allowed a neighbouring state to do this to its citizens and have done so little to achieve justice.  I cannot honestly think of another European country that would have done so.  I appreciate the Government has met the victims.  I appreciate the Government has denounced these actions strongly.  I appreciate the Government has laid wreaths at the monuments.  For sure it has raised this over and over again with the British but all with very little impact.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Kenova is a criminal investigation into RUC involvement in the murder of 18 people alleged to have happened to protect a double agent codenamed Stakeknife.  I understand that files in the hands of the Garda are sought by Operation Kenova.  I also understand there is a block on those files being given to Jon Boutcher who is in charge of the investigation.  That cannot be tolerated.  No excuse can be provided for that block.  I also know there are many cases where there is enough evidence to prosecute actions that happened in the past.  The PSNI is not prosecuting them.  I ask the Minister to meet the Chief Constable of the PSNI and demand a way to act on these prosecutions.  The information coming to light in these reports could lead to further prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government is a signatory to international agreements such as the Good Friday Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.  I appeal to the Minister to use every tool he can to make sure we hold the British to account with regard to those agreements.  I include using Ireland's position on the UN Security Council to ensure an investigation is held into this.  The Irish Government must tell the British Government now that if it proceeds with an amnesty with regard to Irish people murdered by the British state, the Irish Government will launch a judicial review against the legislation on the basis it will likely contravene the European Convention on Human Rights, the Good Friday Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p> <p>If the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was to do that in very clear terms to the British, it would send a very strong message to them that if they proceed with a British amnesty, they will have a legal battle on their hands to achieve it.  If the Irish Government does not do that, we in Aont&uacute; will do it.  We will endeavour to do it through our members who have suffered violence from the British state over the years.<\/p> <p> I also ask that the Government seek to create an all-Ireland commission of investigation that would share some of the characteristics of the Smithwick tribunal and would allow for witnesses to come from both sides of the Border to give evidence on what happened with British state collusion.  I understand that because it is a different jurisdiction there would be problems with it and that it would not be 100% as effective as we would like to be, but I also believe that it would shed light on the hundreds of murders that were carried out by the British state in Ireland.  I ask the Minister to seek the creation of that commission of investigation as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300043#WW00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645632120,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland report, which I absolutely welcome, confirms what a lot of us presumed was the situation, but without the details, for a long time.  I have attended previous presentations from people who have done a lot of study on this issue of collusion.  They have suggested that there were major abuses of policing and of authority in the North of Ireland during all of the Troubles period, and since.<\/p>  <p>  Like everybody else here, I support the position that has been adopted by the Government on the proposal for a statute of limitations.  It is one thing that there is all-party agreement in Northern Ireland, but I was very surprised that any government in Westminster made the proposal when all of the parties were against it.<\/p>  <p>  We need to go and investigate what happened.  That has been promised a good few times, but to do that we must get sight of all of the files including all the MI5 files.  There is no doubt in my mind not only that was there collusion from police, but that it went to the heart of policy in London in MI5.  Until we get to the bottom of what really happened, I do not believe that people will have faith in justice and security issues in that jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting here today that since 1998, relatively few prisoners have gone to prison for anything that happened prior to the ceasefires.  I can think of one such person because he was a cause of me getting involved in this whole issue all over again back in 2011, and that is Gerry McGeough who was convicted for something that happened in 1982.  We have never seen this happen on the other side.  To my knowledge, no loyalist, no military and no police were ever convicted of pre-ceasefire events.  I understand that there are a handful of others who have been convicted.  I believe that even-handedness and fairness is absolutely vital in the enforcement of the law.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to raise another present issue where there is a huge inequality, particularly if we are not going to try or convict anybody else.  It relates to those who were convicted and let out under the Good Friday Agreement.  They are not free; they are out on licence.  If they commit a crime that has nothing to do with violence - I will not say an ordinary crime, but a crime not associated with any paramilitary activity - their licence can be revoked without another trial.  Again, we see a huge inequality of treatment here.  This is a real live issue in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister knows, and I know, that the role of double agents in Northern Ireland is as alive today as it was during the Troubles.  We are aware of the McFadden affair, which still has to come to trial.  It is a clear case of an agent operating on a double agent basis.  I find it totally objectionable that the State is involved in actually encouraging people to get involved in violence.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue I wish to raise is around legacy.  Many people have referred very thoroughly to the historic issues, but I have only a limited number of minutes here.  As the Minister will be aware, in the separated regime on the republican side in Northern Ireland - I have been on about this endless times and the Minister has heard my representations - strip searching is still going on, otherwise called \"full body\" searching, even though they know there are no drugs in the republican wing, and anything else they might be bringing in could be ascertainable, as happened in Portlaoise Prison, by other means.  The Minister is aware that there is controlled movement in the prisons, whereby no more than four can come out on the landings, even though there are only 12 or 13 such prisoners in total there.  The Minister will also know that stop and search has been going on at a very high level with certain families, and family bank accounts have been closed down meaning they cannot get their social welfare payments.  Is the Minister aware that there are delays of up to eight years?  People are either spending time on remand or on very strict bail conditions whereby they must sign on every day, and effectively they are not able to take up employment.  People are waiting up to eight years for a trial.  These are all legacy issues.  They are a carryover of the treatment that always seems to fall on one side, from the time of the Troubles.<\/p>  <p>  We need to go forward.  I have spent the past 11 years trying to encourage people who might have been of a different view to mine that the only way forward is through politics, negotiation, dialogue and peaceful methods.  At times I find that one of the biggest barriers to doing so is the behaviour of certain sections.  I would very much divide the authorities between the secret authorities and the secret police who answer to London and MI5, as opposed to community policing which tends to operate to a much more open and better community standard.  We have a lot of outstanding issues.<\/p>  <p>  A truth commission should be set up, totally separate from the prosecution issue.  Everybody is against a statute of limitations, but a truth commission should also be set up rather than relying on an ombudsman to do something on a hotchpotch basis compared to a full truth commission.  If there is going to be a truth commission, we need to get sight of the MI5 files and all of the security files held by the British for the period, even though I have a funny feeling that these files would really shock people with a certain reading of events in Northern Ireland if they could get sight of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300044#XX00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1645632120,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I acknowledge what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said.

It shines more light onto this painful past for so many families in Northern Ireland, for survivors of violence, and for the families of those who have been lost to violence.<\/p> <p>I would like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims named in this report, families who have acknowledged that they feel vindicated by the report after decades of campaigning for the truth to be published in this way.  Of course, it has vindicated what they felt.<\/p> <p> The most striking thing for me in the report is, as always, the story of the people and how painful it is in the case of Patrick McErlain, Daniel Cassidy, Bernard O'Hagan, Thomas Donaghy, Patrick Shanaghan, Eddie Fullerton and Gerald Casey that there have been no prosecutions to date.  The stories that are told of them add to our analysis and the honesty we need about the past.  <\/p> <p> As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said, whether we are discussing the victims of Bloody Sunday, Kingsmill, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, Birmingham, Omagh, the Sean Graham bookmaker's attack, the Shankill Road, Pat Finucane or Edgar Graham, every family has been affected and has had a loss in an equal way.  Every family deserves to be treated in an equal way.  Nobody is above the law and every murder must be treated in the same way by the law.  <\/p> <p> How we address legacy is so important.  We simply cannot move forward without addressing the past.  We know that from this experience.  As we know what it means to families, we continue to resist the outrageous British attempt to override the Stormont House Agreement with an effort to place a statute of limitations on the events of the past.  It is directly contradictory to the core Stormont House principles of the dominance of the rule of law and reconciliation.  The effort to wipe it under the carpet, as it were, instead of addressing it face on and directly in an open court is a difficult shade from the past.<\/p> <p> I commend the Government and the all-party resistance to this.  It is something that needs to be taken outside of Ireland, as has been said.  The story of the retrenchment by the British Government in stepping back from the rule of law as a basic principle of a democracy and how democratic institutions can and should work has to be told internationally.  As Ministers travel over the week of St. Patrick's Day, there will be subtle opportunities here and there to tell that story more broadly.  The report identifies significant investigative intelligence failures, a range of collusive behaviours and an unjustifiable use of informants by the special branch.  I have run out of time, but I want to say that this is report is important for all of the families and all of us.

As we know, it occurred on 30 January 1972.  We know that British soldiers shot 26 unarmed civilians during a peaceful protest march in the Bogside area of Derry.  It is a great community, a community which has shown true resilience despite the darkest of times and great suffering.  I have visited the community on a number of occasions.<\/p>  <p>  All of the killings in the North were an atrocity, but Bloody Sunday stands out in many ways for the wrong reasons because it was a normal day and peaceful protest.  What we saw in documentaries about Bloody Sunday is etched in many people's minds, along with many other events that we remember for, unfortunately, the wrong reasons.  We know that 14 people died in Derry - 13 were killed outright while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries.  Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded.  Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by British Army vehicles while others were beaten.<\/p>  <p>  The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to protest against interment without trial.  It was its absolute right, as it is the right of any group, to hold a peaceful protest, in particular when people were suffering under such injustice and a harsh regime at the time.  The soldiers that carried out the atrocity were from the first battalion of the parachute regiment, the same battalion implicated in the Ballymurphy massacre several months earlier.  I watched a documentary on that very recently.  What happened there was absolutely horrendous, and there are many unanswered questions for families caught up in that who suffered.  At one point a priest ran across the green in Ballymurphy and was gunned down.  What happened was shocking.<\/p>  <p>  There are questions which need to be answered.  We need to ensure that the British Government is held accountable and an amnesty is not the answer.  It is not acceptable.  It will deepen the wounds of so many suffering families.  We need answers, and we need to make sure the Government asks questions and get answers from the British Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300045#YY00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1645632720,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about this important subject.  Good living people all over the world, in whatever country they are in, look up to the police.  Instead of doing their job fairly and properly, police in Northern Ireland threw petrol on the flames at that time.  The report has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was collusion at a high level between the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries.  When we talk about the RUC, we can be sure that what happened went all of the way to the top, including whatever Ministers were in government at the time.  They were and are responsible for what happened.  When we talk about specific police or soldiers who carried out atrocities or were involved in them, politicians at the highest levels were certainly involved as well.  When campaigning during the last election, Boris Johnson said that if he was elected he would grant an amnesty to former policemen.  Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost family members or friends and relatives in this way.  To deny justice in this way would cause further heartbreak to families, relatives and friends.

The conflict often referred to as the Troubles has its origins in the 1921 division of Ireland and has reflected the struggle between different national, cultural and religious identities.<\/p><p>The latest controversial plans by the British Government to introduce a Troubles amnesty could be postponed until the summer of 2022.  These plans will rob victims and their families of any hope of receiving justice and transparency.  Under the proposals revealed by Secretary of State Brandon Lewis last summer, Westminster officials intend to introduce a statue of limitation, a <i>de facto<\/i>amnesty for Troubles-related incidents.  It also plans to end conflict-related civil proceedings and inquests.  <\/p><p>Legislation had been expected before Christmas 2021, but this date has slipped.  It has now been reported that the contentious Bill may not become law until summer or late spring.

This is reprehensible.  Instead, a truly victim-focused process, taking all of the views of those victims into account, must be put front and centre, as set out in the Stormont House Agreement.  The British Government has no support for its position in the North or in the Republic.  Therefore, the Government must step up and advocate more strongly for the victims' position.  <\/p><p>Issuing press statements and soundbites is one thing, but what is really needed is a forthright and robust dialogue with the British Government.  The Government must take a defined position on this matter and insist on the setting up of legacy institutions set out under the Stormont House Agreement.

The report was an investigation into the police handling of certain paramilitary murders and attempted murders from 1989 to 1993.<\/p> <p>This report found incriminating evidence of collusive behaviours between the police force at the time, the RUC, its special branch and loyalist paramilitaries.  I start by addressing the fact that I know the report made a point of using the term collusive behaviours, but we should really just call it what it is, which is outright collusion.  There is no doubt that what occurred here was collusion and although the report was, of course, a shocking read, it was hardly a surprising one.  It was common knowledge that the RUC was working alongside loyalist paramilitaries at the time.  It is long overdue for this to be recognised in an official sense, which has now been done with the publication of the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.<\/p> <p> I welcome the publication of this report.  As the ombudsman Ms Anderson said, the report shows that the families&rsquo; concerns regarding collusion were legitimate and justified.  It is about time that these concerns are taken seriously and I am glad that the ombudsman recognised this.  The report details a number of failings which led to the arming of the UDA with military assault rifles, failings in the handling of informants suspected of being involved in serious criminality and failings in the handling of police officers passing information to loyalist paramilitaries.  The report also detailed the consistent failure of the police to warn individuals of threats to their lives, as well as the deliberate destruction of records relating to informants who were suspected of having been involved in serious criminality.  It goes on to look at specific cases that demonstrated evidence of collusion, including the Castlerock murders, the Greysteel murders, the attempted murders of Patrick McErlain and James McCorriston and the murders of Malachy Carey, Daniel Cassidy, Bernard O'Hagan, Thomas Donaghy, Patrick Shanaghan, Gerard Casey and Eddie Fullerton.<\/p> <p> Eddie Fullerton was a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor in my constituency, Donegal, and was murdered by the UDA in his home in Buncrana on 25 May 1991.  This report shows that the police force in the North colluded with loyalist paramilitaries in the murder of Eddie.  It has been found that the police passed on information that assisted the UDA in targeting him and that police officers assisted the UDA in crossing the Border back to the North following his murder.  The police force then failed to assist the garda&iacute; in their investigation into Eddie's murder, due to the fact that he was a Sinn F&eacute;in elected representative.  They failed to inform the garda&iacute; that the weapons used in the murder were also used in other loyalist attacks and they failed to give all available intelligence relating to individuals suspected of having been involved in the murder.  Not only did the RUC assist in Eddie Fullerton's murder, but it also assisted in the cover-up of his murder.  This is a clear example of collusion.  There is no other word for it.  Any suggestion that this is merely collusive behaviour is completely disingenuous and only serves to further hurt those affected by the collusion of the police and loyalist paramilitaries in the North at this time.<\/p> <p> The silence from the South of Ireland, particularly the Irish Government, regarding this is deafening.  I feel that sometimes the Irish State&rsquo;s role in the North, and particularly the Good Friday Agreement, is forgotten.  We must remember that the Good Friday Agreement was intended for the Republic of Ireland as well as the North.  I do not think we take our role in the peace process seriously enough.  It is up to us to support both communities in the North and to recognise that there is a community in the North that identifies with this State as much as we do.  We need to ensure that fairness and equality are championed and that, should evidence of inequality come to light, such as this report, it is taken seriously and condemned.<\/p> <p> Even though it was well known that collusion was occurring, very little was done to address issues in policing in the North at the time or indeed in the South.  Although the violent coercion and witness intimidation of the heavy gang in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been well documented, it has never been properly investigated.  I would call for a similar report in the South to investigate the heavy gang's activities within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties states that rights-based policing should be at the heart of how our police force is run.  This is what we should aspire to, North and South.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that the Police Ombudsman's report is damning.  The report confirms in black and white that the RUC worked with informers who were part of loyalist paramilitary groups, that targeted individuals such as Eddie Fullerton were not warned of the threat against their lives, and that more than 80 people were murdered by loyalist weapons imported in an arms shipment that the RUC was aware of.  Although the report gives evidence to what we already know, it is an important step in recognising and justifying the concerns of the families of the victims and an important step in furthering the peace process in the North.<\/p> <p> The report is very clear about RUC collusion but it is important for us to remember that this did not happen in isolation.  The British Government was controlling all these organisations through MI5, the police and paramilitaries.  They knew what was happening and were not silent observers of the outcome of their policies.  That is the big lie of the peace process that has allowed the British to somehow present themselves as innocent observers.<\/p> <p> I hope that we in the South start to take a more active role in this process to ensure a fairer and better society across the whole island of Ireland.  While there was collusion by the RUC, it was not doing this in isolation or off its own bat, but with the blessing of the British Government.  The Irish Government and Parliament have to lay that out clearly.  That has to be the final nail to link everything together, because it was part of British Government policy.  Other Members have spoken about their surprise at seeing the British Government shutting all this down.  I am not at all surprised.  Why would it not shut this down?  It is at the heart of this.  That has to be shown all the way through this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300045#YY00500","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645633320,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Before I respond to what has been said, I, like others, express my condolences to the family of Christopher Stalford, who I knew quite well from time spent in Belfast.  He was a tough negotiator, but he was deeply committed to his family, to politics and to the DUP.  I express my sincere condolences to his wife, his family, his broader circle of friends and to the DUP as a party on the untimely death of Christopher.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all those who have spoken this evening and contributed in a full way to this important discussion.  The strength of feeling in relation to these issues is very clear.  Across this House and across political parties, we share common concerns and a common sense of purpose on the need to address, fully and openly, the darker moments in the history of the conflict on this island for all communities.  I know that we stand in solidarity with the families who have been impacted by the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s reports and their significant and deeply concerning findings.  As I stated at the outset of this debate, these reports are testament to the importance of the work of the office of the Police Ombudsman.  The reports are a concrete contribution to dealing with the past.  They show that there are important truths that can still be uncovered for families, even regarding such difficult and complex cases.  They show that there are important things to be brought to light, not just from the early 1970s, but in significantly more recent times, including the 1990s.  The ombudsman&rsquo;s findings in relation to the significant intelligence and investigative failures she has identified, and the collusive behaviours by the RUC during these periods of time, must be acknowledged fully.  It is only through the rigorous examination of past failings that we can have confidence that no such failings will be repeated in future.  The victims and families can hopefully feel some measure of comfort that their concerns have been shown to be fully justified and valid.  I am sure this does not ease the pain that has undoubtedly been relived with every page of these reports as they read through them.<\/p>  <p>  The peace process has shown the extraordinary capacity of all communities in Northern Ireland to work for reconciliation and a better, brighter future for the next generation.  There are young people in Derry, Belfast and Fermanagh who have not known the lived experience of conflict, and that is an achievement once unthinkable, which must be safeguarded.  I have taken a consistent message from my meetings with victims, families, political parties and civil society organisations in my time as Minister, which is that until the legacy of the past is addressed, society will continue to carry the burden of the past into the future, and it will rest on the shoulders of the next generation whether we like it or not.  I have seen young people born after the Troubles from families that have been so deeply impacted by trauma that they carry these burdens too.  We need to make sure we do not allow the psychological legacy to be passed on without every possible effort to address and reduce it.  Wounds will not heal by simply deciding that it is time to move on.  We must face it, and acknowledge it, and where a process of justice is possible, it must be applied.<\/p> <p>It is only through doing this that we can support a society that can be fully confident in its institutions, in peace and the rule of law, and in the protection of every citizen's fundamental human rights.<\/p> <p> As I said, there is undoubtedly significant work and an important role for the Irish Government in addressing the legacy of conflict across this island.  We intend to play our full part in that process, and a number of speakers have spoken pointedly in that regard.  That is why we passed the Criminal Justice (International Co-Operation) Act to support the Kingsmill inquest and other inquests.  That is why we have consistently sought, and continue to seek, an agreed way forward and a comprehensive system that works in both jurisdictions.  Together with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, we reached the Stormont House Agreement after an extensive and challenging period of negotiation.  We have continued to press for its implementation and to engage to address the concerns the British Government has expressed about its implementation.  We will continue to do that and we are ready and willing to see how we might once again find an agreed path forward.<\/p> <p> As I made clear today, however, and at every other opportunity, we can move forward on this issue only collectively and we can accept only an approach based on the fundamental principles of truth, justice and the rule of law.  That is surely not too much to ask.  As I am sure we each experience when we read the reports of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, or when we meet with victims from across the community who have suffered such loss, reflected last month on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the feelings of unfairness and injustice are powerful.  The case for a process to address that sense of injustice, through thorough investigation and, where possible, prosecution, is clear.<\/p> <p> I will continue, through my engagement with victims, parties and the British Government, to push for genuine progress and to seek to bring about a process that delivers for victims and families and allows for the possibility of reconciliation.  This must not be the drawing of a veil but, rather, a clear and transparent system in which families are supported to seek truth and justice and which allows for broader societal progress.  I will continue to engage with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to caution strongly against unilateral action or the introduction of a general amnesty that will bring about only extended years of hardship, legal challenge and pain for many families.  I will also continue to keep the Members of this House updated on that work.  I thank them for their consistent support on this most important and challenging issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300046#ZZ00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Ukrainian Delegation","time":1645633920,"counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300047#AAA00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1645633920,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I ask Members to extend a warm welcome to the new Ukrainian ambassador, H.E.

In 2014 Russia invaded Ukraine and illegally annexed the Crimea peninsula.  Since then, the conflict in Ukraine's eastern region of Donbas has endured, with dire humanitarian consequences.<\/p>  <p>  On Monday night the United Nations Secretary General stated that the decision of the Russian Federation to recognise the independence of the non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine was a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  A rare emergency session of the United Nations Security Council was convened late on Monday night.  In her opening remarks to the session, UN Under-Secretary General Rosemary DiCarlo captured the gravity of this moment, stating, \"The risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs.\"  Ireland spoke clearly to underline that the decision to recognise the breakaway territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine is a flagrant violation of international law.  Ireland sought a seat on the Security Council because of our belief in multilateralism.  As we said on Monday night in New York, the Security Council and its members have the responsibility to work to resolve this conflict.  This is the time to show the courage to pull back from the precipice and to return to dialogue and diplomacy.  Ireland believes in and is fully committed to the core principles enshrined in the UN Charter.  These include sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states.  Ukraine has the same fundamental right as every other sovereign and independent state to choose its own foreign policy and to ensure the security and defence of its own people and territory.  The commitments we make as members of the UN are binding on every one of us, with no exceptions, regardless of how big or powerful a member state is.<\/p>  <p>  It is our responsibility as a Parliament to stand up and to speak out to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.  Those borders have not changed.  The decision by President Putin to recognise the so-called people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk does not change those borders one iota.  Ukraine's borders today are what they were on Monday and what they were on its independence more than 30 years ago, in 1991.  In statements in this House and in the Seanad, Members have shown consistent support for Ukraine and an appreciation of the difficulties the country faces.  Last week Ukraine's ambassador to Ireland, who is here with us in the Gallery this evening, addressed our Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, where Members of both Houses, from all parties, expressed their support for Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  That support is reflective of a broad sympathy with Ukraine across Irish society.  That sense of solidarity has been palpable as this crisis has dominated international news in recent weeks and months.  We have in recent times welcomed closer links with Ukraine, driven by increasing business and family ties.  I understand that Ukrainians are now in the top ten of dual national communities in Ireland by population at well more than 4,000 families.<\/p>  <p>  Here in Ireland, we know the value of the rules-based international order.  It has served us very well.  We know the importance of respecting the voice and integrity of all countries, big, small and medium-sized.  Most fundamentally, we know the value of peace.  We know that one state threatening and using lethal force against another to get its way or to expand its territory is no solution.  Ireland has a deep understanding, informed by our own history, that it is dialogue and respect, not violence, that resolve disputes.  This drives our solidarity with Ukraine this evening and will drive it in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  For many months Russia has been conducting a build-up of troops near and around Ukraine.  It is currently estimated there are at least 110 Russian battalion tactical groups and 190,000 troops in place in and around Ukraine's borders with Russia and Belarus.  In addition, we see the deployment of very substantial naval assets, including in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, as well as combat aircraft and helicopters.  This massive build-up of troops and combat equipment is happening at the same time as a significant increase in false flag operations, disinformation and propaganda efforts.<\/p> <p>All of this would suggest that, contrary to the Russian Government&rsquo;s repeated assertion that it has no wish to invade Ukraine, there is a real possibility President Putin is considering a full-scale invasion of that country.  We see clearly that the Russian Government is willing to use military aggression against Ukraine in order to get what it wants.  At this crucial hour, it is important to speak plainly on this matter.  This is what the Russian Government did in 2014 and what it threatens to do again.  This has no place in the modern world, particularly in Europe.  Have we not learnt from history?  A resort to military conquest, for one state to impose its will unilaterally against another or to annex parts of another's territory should be unacceptable to all of us, particularly on this continent.<\/p> <p> The current situation in eastern Ukraine is of grave concern.  The conflict has to date claimed more than 14,000 lives in that area.  Thanks to the efforts of the Trilateral Contact Group, which involves Russia, Ukraine and a representative of the OSCE, a new ceasefire was brokered in 2020.  Unfortunately, in recent weeks there has been a marked increase in ceasefire violations and credible reports of shelling on Ukrainian army positions.  In December, Russia published security demands addressed to NATO.  The substance of some of those demands violated the right of states to pursue their own sovereign foreign policy choices in the context of their own security.  They included demands that there be no further expansion of NATO and that NATO military infrastructure be rolled back from some states.  We in Ireland are clear that it is our sovereign choice which international organisations we should join or not join, as the case may be.  We cannot countenance one state dictating to another which organisations it should be involved with.  This is well understood by all of our EU partners.<\/p> <p> Russia&rsquo;s demands, were they to be seriously entertained, would amount to a significant rewriting of Europe&rsquo;s security architecture, by which I mean, essentially, the set of agreements which were put in place in the decades following the Second World War to ensure that the horrific events of those years would not be repeated.  The destruction of the war years was enabled by the belief that military might makes right, regardless of other considerations.  That is the culture which leads to world wars.  After the unprecedented devastation created by the combination of this philosophy with modern weaponry, that culture was no longer tenable for Europe.  That is why we put in place the agreements I refer to, including, under the auspices of the OSCE, the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.  These agreements and a return to the Normandy format continue to offer the framework for a diplomatic resolution of the current situation.<\/p> <p> The suffering and immense fortitude of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples during the Second World War is well known and remembered.  I am sure the Russian people do not want to see Europe return to war.  Our deep concern about the actions of the Russian leadership does not diminish the friendship and respect we have for ordinary Russians, including those who have built a future in Ireland.  This issue is wider than Ukraine.  It affects the whole of Europe.  This is a challenge to the principles and agreements which have kept Europe comparatively secure and peaceful in our lifetimes.  We cannot take that security and peace for granted any longer.  This is why our solidarity with Ukraine is unwavering.  True solidarity stems from an understanding that a harm against one affects all.  It is with this sense of unity and mutuality that we extend our continued support to the people of Ukraine.  <\/p> <p> For a year, EU discussions on Russia&rsquo;s aggressive stance towards Ukraine and EU contacts with the Ukrainian Government have been intensive.  Some commentary has suggested EU disunity on the issue.  I want to address that directly because EU unity, in my experience, has been remarkable.  Each of the EU 27 member states has its own concerns, emphases, history and geography and different states have different relationships with Russia.  However, there has not been disunity.  Every state has recognised the grave threat Russia&rsquo;s aggressive stance towards Ukraine poses to peace and stability on our continent. <\/p> <p> In April 2021, EU foreign ministers were united in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  They were united when I attended the international Crimea platform in Kyiv in August, expressing Ireland&rsquo;s support for the peaceful de-occupation of Crimea by Russia.  Our countries&rsquo; leaders met in the European Council on 16 December where they reiterated the EU&rsquo;s full support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and made it abundantly clear that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response.  In January, I and my fellow foreign ministers met in France.  The security situation was discussed in detail and unity was the dominant theme of the conversation then, as it is today.  The conclusions which followed the 24 January Foreign Affairs Council show the strength of EU consensus on this most serious of issues, namely, the security of our continent.  The EU reaffirmed our commitment to the core principles on which European security is built, enshrined in the UN Charter and the founding documents of the OSCE, including the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris.  These include notably the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all states, refraining from the threat or use of force, and the freedom of states to choose or change their own security arrangements.  We reaffirmed that these principles are neither negotiable nor subject to revision or reinterpretation.  We stated that their violation by Russia is an obstacle to a common and indivisible security space in Europe and threatens peace and stability on our continent.  We also underlined the role of the OSCE as the appropriate forum to address security concerns of all interested parties.  We welcomed the efforts of the Polish chair-in-office to swiftly initiate a substantial dialogue on European security.<\/p> <p> The decisions which Russia has taken this week to violate the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine stand as a severe breach of international law and of international agreements which Russia has signed.  Russia has broken its commitments to work with the Normandy format and the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group to find a peaceful settlement and is violating UN Security Council Resolution 2202, which requires full implementation of the Minsk agreements.  <\/p> <p> Together with our EU partners, we have urged Russia to reverse its recognition, uphold its commitments, abide by international law and return to meaningful negotiations and dialogue without delay.  I have instructed senior officials in my Department to summon the Russian ambassador this evening to underline Ireland&rsquo;s strong views on these issues.  The EU has responded swiftly to Monday&rsquo;s moves by Russia, as is clearly warranted.  In close co-ordination with international partners, discussions have been ongoing on an initial package of targeted sanctions, which was adopted this afternoon. <\/p> <p> The EU sanctions will target the following: 336 members of the Russian state Duma who voted for this violation of international law and of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, in addition to 22 members already on EU sanctions lists; 26 decision-makers responsible for the threatening of Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity and individuals and entities financially or materially supporting them or benefitting from them; those in the defence sector who play a role in destabilising actions and those who wage a disinformation war against Ukraine; selected banks that are financing Russian decision-makers and other operations in those territories; economic relations between the two breakaway regions and the EU, to ensure that those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions; and <\/p> <p>the ability of the Russian state and Government to access the EU&rsquo;s capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of aggressive policies.<\/p> <p>The EU stands ready to adopt additional measures later, if needed, in light of further developments.  Ireland will work to ensure that all EU sanctions are implemented here, including in respect of financial services and the IFSC.  At this critical moment, Ireland stands alongside Ukraine and reaffirms that an attack on Ukraine would represent an attack on the entire rules-based international order.  Such an attack will be met with severe consequences, as I think we have made very clear.  <\/p> <p> What I want to focus on in my final comments is that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only way forward and the best way to resolve political differences and preserve peace.  The alternative is war and sanctions in both directions.  In that scenario, not only will Ukraine, unfortunately, suffer the enormous human cost of war, with thousands of people losing their lives, but the very security structure of relationships on this continent between Russia and the rest of Europe will be fundamentally changed for the worst for quite some time to come.  The focus, therefore, must not be on how we respond to increasing conflict or war, but how we prevent it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300047#AAA00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645635120,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador to the Chamber to listen to an important debate at a difficult time.  It is difficult to overstate the significance of what is happening in Ukraine and of the dangers that Russian aggression holds for international peace.  The potential for a devastating conflict is, unfortunately, very real.  I take this opportunity to restate my party's commitment to the principles inherent in United Nations Resolution 68\/262 adopted by the General Assembly on 27 March 2014 concerning the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty.  The UN resolution specifically calls on all states \"to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means\".  From the beginning, we in Sinn F&eacute;in have appealed to all sides to attempt to achieve a peaceful resolution and to use the Minsk agreements as a means to pursue dialogue towards such a peaceful solution.  I offered Sinn F&eacute;in's support to the ambassador of the Ukraine last week when she attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  I again restate my party's support.  I also met with the Russian ambassador to voice our concerns and opposition to the Russian actions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a role to play in the international arena in search of a peaceful outcome.  As a member of the UN Security Council and as a neutral nation, Ireland has the moral standing in the international community and political platforms at the UN Security Council and in the EU to actively pursue a course of action to push for a de-escalation of the current crisis in Ukraine.  As a neutral nation, we must be seen to represent and to remain a voice for calm and reason, even in these difficult times, using our position at the UN and in the EU to push for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.  It is important that politicians here at home do not exploit this serious crisis to attempt to challenge our neutrality by pushing us down the road towards participation in any future EU army.  Ireland is and should remain a neutral country.  I take this opportunity to state that I believe our neutrality should be enshrined in our Constitution.  <\/p>  <p>  I also record Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to the occupation and annexation of the sovereign territory of any people by force, be that in eastern Europe or, indeed, in the West Bank.  It is impossible to avoid making comparisons between the urgency of the response of the United States, of Britain and of the EU to the crisis in Ukraine and their tepid response to the ongoing human rights abuses in Palestine, to the crime of apartheid and to the active acceptance by the Trump administration of the Israeli seizure of the Golan Heights.  The territorial integrity of all peoples must be respected, and not just those who serve the strategic interests of a powerful few.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the comments from the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, who stated last week that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected.  China, as a close ally of Russia, is in a unique position to exercise influence and to convince the Russians to search for a solution through dialogue and consultation.  We are addressing a very live issue, which is developing hour by hour and even minute by minute.  Only this evening, I believe, there has been another cyberattack on Ukraine, which is ongoing as we speak.  We heard today as well that Ukraine is mobilising its reserves, calling for Ukrainian citizens to leave Russia and that the country is on the cusp of a general mobilisation.  <\/p>  <p>  Alarmingly, a top US diplomat has reportedly cancelled a meeting with his Russian counterpart.  This is all signalling, unfortunately, an increasing escalation in tensions.  All attempts at a diplomatic solution must continue.  Dialogue must continue.  Difficulties in discerning the reality of what is happening are compounded by deliberate and misleading campaigns of disinformation.  It is unfortunate that the webs of lies which were spun by the Bush administration and the British Government concerning the presence of weapons of mass destruction, WMD, to justify the invasion of Iraq have left us with a deep imprint of scepticism when we listen to the sabre-rattling of Boris Johnson.  This is the same Boris Johnson who is the Prime Minister of Britain and the leader of the Conservative Party, a party which has a secret advisory committee of ultra-rich donors who enjoy complete access to the most senior members of the British Government.  Some of these mega-rich donors are known to have links with the Putin regime.  One member of the secret group has been revealed to be the wife of President Putin's former finance minister.  Incredibly, when Boris Johnson talks about sanctions, he is also, and perhaps unwittingly, talking about members of the inner circle of the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  This is not to say that we in Ireland can take a high-handed and morally-superior position in respect of financial dealings with Russian oligarchs.  Ireland has long been the destination and washing ground for billions of euro of Russian oligarchs' money.  As far back as 2019, Sinn F&eacute;in exposed a total of 106 shell companies registered in Ireland with Russian connections.  I refer to firms with no employees, no fixed assets and paying minimal tax, if any.  This is an issue that my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has addressed here on several occasions.  The failure of the financial regulatory system is shocking.  It is this weak financial regulation and lax oversight that has made Ireland such an attractive location to raise funds in for Russian oligarchs linked to the regime.  A total of &euro;118 billion has been funnelled through this State to Russia.  I refer to one instance of a bank part-owned by President Putin himself and another of a bank that has been described by the Russian central bank as \"a special-purpose bank for serving military-industrial complex business\".<\/p> <p>Another company under sanctions of the US used a shell company registered in Ireland to raise funds in 2014 and again in 2016.  The responsibility for this lies with successive governments that have presided over a financial system described as the wild west of European finance.<\/p> <p> It is important the House sends out a clear message that we stand up for international law and humanitarian law, irrespective of whether it is in eastern Europe or the West Bank.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support a cross-party motion based on the UN General Assembly Resolution of 2014 that deals with the territorial integrity of Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300049#CCC00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645635720,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I welcome the Ukrainian ambassador.  The situation developing in Ukraine is very troubling and worrying for people everywhere.  Certainly here in Ireland, we have had our share of conflict and violence not just for decades but for centuries.  All of that comes from the notion of imperial power and what that has done.  We remember 1917, the Russian Revolution and the fall of an empire at that time.  The end of the First World War came on the back of that.  What has happened since then and the disintegration of the communist regimes across Europe and Russia is that we have seen the establishment in Russia of what is, in effect, another imperialist regime.  That sense of Putin and his regime is very much one where might is right at all times.  That is very dangerous and troubling and is at the core of this difficulty we now have.<\/p>  <p>  What happened on Monday evening was clearly a situation where Russia decided it would invade a part of Ukraine, and possibly all of Ukraine.  If you invade part of a country, you have invaded all of it.  The integrity of a nation includes all of its borders and territorial waters.  That is the situation we see.  This excuse that these two regions are somehow or other separate or are their own entity and that Russia is in there to protect them is clearly an excuse for an invasion, and all of us can see that.  Our discussion is about security in Europe and that aggression is troubling not just for Ukraine.  It is troubling for all the countries around Ukraine, for the entire region and Continent and, indeed, for the entire world.  We cannot continue in a situation where this notion of might is right can become a dominant feature in international politics.  That needs to end and needs to change.  We certainly had hoped that we had left those attitudes in our colonial and imperialist past, that we had moved into a new era, and that the United Nations and the sense of co-operation and nations working together for the greater good of humanity was the way forward.  That is certainly the way we intend to continue in spite of what others may do and in spite of whatever intentions Putin and his regime may have.  We still need to get back down to the fact we need have the means of addressing these issues through dialogue and diplomacy.  When a conflict breaks out and people are hurt, injured and killed and there is terrible dismay and mayhem, at the end of it all you go back to negotiations and talks to work out a solution.<\/p>  <p>  What we need to do is to apply as much pressure as possible to work out that solution now and to put the diplomacy in place to do that.  We certainly will support the Irish Government and all the other governments of Europe to try to do that.  If a motion comes before the House, I am sure it will have the support of all parties to deliver that message strongly to the European Union and our colleagues in Ukraine that we stand with them in this hour of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300050#DDD00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1645635720,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I recognise that the Ukrainian ambassador is with us in the House today.  I spoke earlier, as my colleague Deputy Brady alluded to, on the use of section 110 of the tax code in the IFSC and the funnelling of money.  What I am speaking on now is broader and concerns security situations within Europe.  One of the EU Commission will have us believe is that halting climate change is its top priority.  Of course, the impending climate catastrophe has to be stopped.  However, in the summer of 2021, it decided for the first time since the founding of the Common Market to allocate funds directly from the EU budget to fund the military, and this decision is a disaster for the planet.  Everyone knows the carbon footprint of war and weaponry is a major accelerator of climate change.  Worse still, we are not talking about paltry sums.  The sum involved is colossal at &euro;49 billion.  If the truth were told, there were plans to almost double that figure, but that was only prevented due to the cost of the Covid pandemic.  What an utter waste of resources, when one thinks how these resources could be employed for the common good, including battling climate change.  The amount of waste in the manufacture of armaments, from the production of the metals to the consumption of fossil fuels to the running of tanks or warplanes, is vast.  War and armaments are the very antithesis of sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  Another sinister plan was to suck in the Irish industry and SMEs to be involved in this military-industrial sector.  A report from the EU defence ministers' summit in 2020 referred to Enterprise Ireland being directly involved in bringing Irish SMEs into this work.  The buzzword behind developing an EU military-industrial complex and an EU army is \"autonomy\" but what about Irish autonomy or, another word, neutrality?  The Minister needs to project that positive neutrality.  It was our past neutral stance that got us elected, by the small nations of the world, to the UN Security Council.  I am concerned that a security and military union is scheduled to be the next stage of EU integration.<\/p>  <p>  As long ago as 2016, the then Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, called for an EU security union with the end goal of establishing an EU army.  When the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, Junker tweeted, \"Permanent Structured Cooperation is happening.  I welcome the operational steps taken today by Member States to lay the foundations of a European #DefenceUnion.\"  The European Parliament, meanwhile, called for the EU to upgrade its military to use its full potential as a world power.  In December 2017, Ireland joined PESCO in the first steps of the formation of this.  Membership of PESCO obliges the State to increase military spending from its current 0.3% of GDP, the lowest in the EU, to a potential 2%.  We have a proud tradition of neutrality and we must reject any ties to these kinds of military alliances.  The reality is we do not want to see the use of warplanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300050#DDD00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1645635720,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I, too, acknowledge the presence of and welcome the Ukrainian ambassador to our debate.<\/p>  <p>  The actions of the Russian Government this week, in recognising the already occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk and moving its military forces across legally recognised international borders, are the most serious threat to European peace since the end of the Cold War.  Extensive diplomatic efforts involving an array of European leaders, Macron, Scholz and Johnson among them, together with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, have sought in recent weeks to broker a peaceful outcome, and I strongly commend these efforts.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of this crisis is the aim and intention of the Russian President.  He is clearly enjoying the focus of international attention, but we cannot as yet be certain of what he ultimately wishes to achieve or what means he is willing to deploy to achieve that.  The character of the regime led by Vladimir Putin has been clear to us all for many years.  He deployed the nerve agent Novichok to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England, in 2018.  This followed the killing of the Putin critic, Alexander Litvinenko, using radioactive polonium in Russia in 2006.  The annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 and the effective occupation by proxy of part of the Donbas region of Ukraine at the same time has resulted in ongoing conflict, which has already cost 14,000 lives over the past eight years.<\/p>  <p>  We know what the international community is dealing with: a Russian president under whom we have witnessed the poisoning and imprisonment of his main domestic opponent Alexei Navalny, and a person who has dominated the Russian state, the Duma and its media.  His vision is for a restoration of Russian hegemony over the countries of eastern Europe where the Soviet Union once held sway.<\/p> <p>He wishes, in short, to undo the past 30 years of political history in Europe.  Those who doubt that should read the words of Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov when he characterised the countries, many of which are now member states of our European Union while others are members of NATO, not as sovereign nations but as territories orphaned by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union.  Orphans, presumably, to be brought back home to mother.<\/p> <p> The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994 was signed by Russia and gave assurances against the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.  It was on that basis that those three nations, newly independent, gave up their nuclear weapons.  Ukraine at that stage was the world's third largest stockpiler of nuclear weapons.  We have heard some commentary that former Soviet-dominated countries could never join NATO.  The NATO-Russia Founding Act was a political agreement signed in 1997, 25 years ago.  It established an agreed co-operation between an enlarged NATO and Russia and stated that countries admitted to NATO will have full rights and responsibilities of membership and, further, the door to membership will remain open to all emerging European democracies.<\/p> <p> More fundamental to this Parliament and to Ireland, where we battled so hard to regain our national independence and to control our destiny and sovereignty, is the right of nations to make their own decisions and not have powerful neighbours make decisions for them.  The phrase we hear often now in a different context, \"nothing about us without us,\" had its origins in central European political traditions.  Too often smaller European nations were simply pawns to be directed by powerful nations and traded over by others without their involvement or consent.  We thought we had put all that behind us, that small nations stand equal to larger nations, entitled to make their own decisions about any international organisation they want to belong to or not.  We thought we did not have any more overarching spheres of influence where large nations determine what smaller nations can or cannot do.  President Putin's speech to his nation on Monday was truly illuminating, describing the now independent nations of the former USSR as \"our country\" and blaming \"Bolshevik\" leaders, presumably former President Gorbachev, for the nation's break-up - developments President Putin clearly wishes to undo, beginning with Ukraine.  <\/p> <p> Ireland has to stand clearly and strongly with the people of Ukraine, with the principle of self-determination and the inviolability of a nation's boundaries.  International law must be upheld and Ireland must be very clear in that.  I have introduced legislation into this House known internationally as the Magnitsky Act.  I ask that one of the actions we take is to fast-track that and enact it into the law of this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300050#DDD00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645636320,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in welcoming the Ukrainian ambassador to the Chamber.

Kilometres away from their front door are 150,000 Russian troops who are not there to keep the peace and are certainly not there for sightseeing.<\/p><p>Their intentions were laid clear by President Putin earlier in the week in what Deputy Howlin correctly called an illuminating speech.  It was a damn straight frightening speech.  It was a window into the mind of a brutal thug of a dictator who has run roughshod over his own country and his entire sphere of influence since he came to power.  He has held power and put in his proxy, Medvedev, and disseminated so much disruption and aggression throughout our Continent, harking back to the darkest days of the cold war and the soviet dictators who preceded him.  It is quite clear he does not see himself as some liberal democrat or as president of an independent Russia.  He sees himself as an extension of the very worst of the Soviet empire.  The facts and events of these past few days have made that achingly clear to the entire world.  It had been already achingly clear to many, particularly in Ukraine, over the past decade.  <\/p><p>While I welcome the sanctions announced by the European Union and formalised today, I question whether they are enough.  There is an emergency European Council meeting tomorrow.  Will there be another one next week?  I fear there may need to be.  While these sanctions, tied with the welcome sanctions from the US Government, non-EU NATO members, the Australian Government and the Japanese Government, may go some way to stalling the aggressive ambition of Vladimir Putin, I do not think they alone will absolutely stop it.  I must join with Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues opposite in criticising the impotent response from the British Government heretofore in dealing with the Russian oligarchs who use the City of London as their plaything.  It was quite telling that the British Prime Minister ran from the Chamber in Westminster yesterday rather than respond directly to the very clear question from the Welsh MP, Chris Bryant about the role of Roman Abramovich.  <\/p><p>Can the Minister confirm that the EU sanctions will also be targeted at those banks operating in occupied South Ossetia in Georgia, through which Russia is funding the proxy governments in Donetsk and Luhansk?  While these welcome sanctions are targeted against regime leaders, Russian banks and Members of the Duma, sanctions must be targeted at all the actors who are ensuring that chaos reigns in eastern Ukraine.  Can the Minister also confirm that the next tranche of sanctions has been already prepared?  One of the most welcome things that came out of yesterday's discussions was the belated announcement by the German Government of the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 project.  It will come at a hardship cost in terms of energy provision for Germany and the wider European Union in due course but it is vitally necessary.  The Minister has mentioned other things such as the staging of the Champions League final in St Petersburg and other diplomatic measures that will come down to the line.  We need to be quite firm about the very clear financial, political and travel sanctions that can still be deployed.  I fear they might yet need to be.<\/p><p>Ireland is right to be extremely worried about what is going on in eastern Ukraine, and what has been going on in the Baltic states, fellow European Union member states like Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, what is going on in Belarus, on the borders of Poland, what has been going on in Kazakhstan and what continues to go on in Georgia.  We are not at a great distance.  We are a &euro;34 flight away from Kyiv.  This is not the other side of the world.  The Russian sphere of influence absolutely stretches to our shores.  Many people raised understandable concerns about Russian naval exercises off the coast of Ireland a number of weeks ago.  It actually happened that special powers were used by the Government two years ago to halt construction at the Russian embassy in Rathgar.  They were not building a conservatory, a Cheann Comhairle.  That was a very real issue.  Two Russian diplomats were expelled from Ireland after the attacks in Salisbury in England.  That was a terrorist attack on sovereign British soil.  We saw the cyber-attack that crippled our health system in August; no doubt if it was not the Russian State it was non-state actors who have the protection of the Russian Government.  Russia Today<i><\/i>employed eight people in the State not so long ago.<\/p> <p>They were based at the Digital Hub, an entity financed by the Irish Government.  We have skin in the game.  There are 150 Irish citizens in Ukraine.  So many surrogates in Ukraine give birth to Irish children.  There are so many Irish prospective parents at their wits&rsquo; end.  These are people who are prepared to travel to Poland and walk to Ukraine to protect their children.<\/p> <p> Members opposite avidly talk about neutrality, but there are occasions when we have to realise we cannot stand ourselves alone.  While I fundamentally welcome the comments of Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies in support of UN resolutions and sanctions, why have Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs abstained countless times in votes in the European Parliament on proposals to impose sanctions on Russia?  After the invasion in 2014, why was it that Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs sat in a European Parliament political group with Irish MEPs who defended the thug who is Vladimir Putin?  Sinn F&eacute;in should not lecture the Government from a height.  It should not lecture the State from a height.  It has enough in this area.  Welcoming the actions of the Chinese Government given the plight of the Uyghur people and what is going on in Hong Kong is certainly something-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300051#EEE00200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Maybe the Deputy should have listened to what I said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":531,"content":"<p>-----but I would call on Deputy Brady to reflect on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Maybe the Deputy should listen to what I said instead of trying to mislead the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00400","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":533,"content":"<p>One speaker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I heard what the Deputy said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00600","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":535,"content":"<p>He tried to mislead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00700","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I heard what he said and am responding directly to his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF00800","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":537,"content":"<p>The Deputy is not; he is trying to mislead.

Does one know what happens to anti-war protesters on the streets of Moscow?  They get locked up and are never heard from again.  It is an utter fantasy that we can grasp our hands and pretend this does not involve us, that we can keep our mind out of it and that it is a matter of two equal aggressors.  This is not about two equal aggressors.  I am referring to the nonsense about NATO expansion.  Independent, sovereign states that spent recent decades with an aggressor to their east sought EU and NATO membership for protection.  This was not some imperialist plot from Washington, which certain Deputies who are not even in the Chamber would have us believe; it was the desperate decision of states that are being threatened, one of which has been invaded, mere kilometres from our shores.  We have to wake up to the reality.  Having an alarm at home does not make you aggressive or militaristic; it is about protecting your family.  Protecting citizens is a responsibility of all governments.  One cannot hide behind a convenient fig leaf.<\/p>  <p>  We had a fundamental debate last week in the Chamber about the future of our Defence Forces.  I never want to see members of the Defence Forces put in harm&rsquo;s way but I do want to see them equipped, paid and protected in carrying out their foremost duty, which is to protect the State.  That is why our defence spending will increase.  The constant references to the desire for an EU army denigrates the debate when we are talking about fundamental security and co-operation.  It may be Ukraine today but it could be Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia tomorrow.  The Estonian people had their entire social welfare system shut down for three days in August due to cyberattacks from Russia.  Therefore, I do not buy the line that we cannot co-operate and that we do not have a fundamental duty and responsibility as an EU member state to co-operate with other like-minded countries.  These are our allies.  We are not alone in the world.<\/p>  <p>  Let me return to the situation at hand.  We are at an extremely perilous point.  We are dealing with a country whose population is the same size as that of Nigeria, whose economy is the same size as that of Italy and whose military is the same size, or a little smaller, than that of France.  The difference is that it is prepared to ruin its economy, jeopardise its population and use its military.  The western world has a duty and responsibility to act.  There are three options on the table.  The third, I hope, will never be availed of because the consequences are so grave.  We need to see continuing, expansive, fundamental sanctions.  We also need to see a continued diplomatic effort, but let us not be fools regarding the state we are negotiating with.  We need to ensure a broadening alliance that includes the EU, US, Australia, Japan, non-EU NATO member states and any other country that believes in democracy.  The speech by the Kenyan foreign minister at the UN Security Council is one we should all refer to.  There are dark days ahead and the worst-case scenario does not bear thinking about.  We are talking about a military escalation that has not been seen since the Balkan wars.  It could be far greater than that.  We could see hordes of refugees flooding into the European Union, fleeing for their lives.  There could be mass murder, mass devastation, energy stoppages and conflict of the most worrying level seen this century, or probably for 75 years.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very sombre debate.  As I stated, it is easy for us to remove ourselves, talk about the figures and refer to the headlines and highlights.  We do not need to demonstrate and talk about our sovereignty to the Ukrainian people.  We need to empathise with the Ukrainian people, who is represented here by their ambassador, and with her family members and friends.  Tomorrow morning, we will wake up not knowing what Vladimir Putin has in mind for them and their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF01000","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh an ambassador.  Sadly, it would appear that in 2022 we still have old men dreaming up new wars for younger men to die in.  We have all watched with growing unease the increase in the military build-up along the border of Ukraine and Russia and what has been a very uneven and fraught relationship between the two states since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  We watched events in this region in 2013 and 2014 and we have seen action, reaction and sanctions.  We have seen how those with the least ability to protect themselves, the ordinary citizens, suffered the direct consequences of others&rsquo; actions and decisions &mdash; neighbours&rsquo; decisions.  The collective psyche of this country continues to be affected by its past, as evidenced in the statements before the current ones in the House.  Our instinct, because we have never invaded and colonised another country, is to align ourselves with those regarded as the smaller dog in the fight, those considered oppressed.  I believe this is one reason so many Ukrainians now call Ireland home.  Ukraine, while rich in mineral resources in addition to natural gas and grain that it exports, has a quite poor economy.  However, it is growing.  Ukraine&rsquo;s people are facing the genuine prospect of invasion and a resulting major conflict with the potential to expand beyond their borders and region.  Contrast their position with the strength of neighbouring Russia.<\/p><p>I will return to an issue Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell referred to earlier, one she raised in September 2020 and that was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  Billions of euro have been funnelled to Russian firms from shell companies based in Ireland.  Section 110 companies based in the IFSC raised funds for some of Russia&rsquo;s most important, state-backed and oligarchically controlled companies previously subject to economic sanctions and accused of criminal activity.  We need to know if this is still the case.  It needs to be clarified.  Are the firms still operating here?  What is their tax status?  To what extent do they avail of tax breaks here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF01100","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1645636920,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The situation in Ukraine has the potential for devastating conflict, conflict that must be avoided.

I am happy to tell the Ukrainians who have made Ireland their home that my party stands in full solidarity with them regarding the territorial integrity of their homeland according the principles of the UN resolution adopted in March 2014.

As has been said, we know what it is like to live next door to a bullying neighbour and to have to feel its boot on your neck.<\/p>  <p>  Like many, I am concerned about the potential for information or, rather, disinformation to become a weapon of mass destruction in its own right.<\/p> <p>Indeed, the Ukrainians have also asked that this warmongering talk be toned down.  I remember the \"sexing up\", as it was referred to at the time, that led to the ratcheting up of tensions and the declaration of an illegal war that unleashed pure hell on Iraq, bringing devastation to its people and the region.  Millions of them are still displaced in another generation.  Today, they are among the people who are piling into boats to make the treacherous crossing to fortress Europe, where the EU shows its own treachery by declaring Libya a zone of safe return.  The barstool soldiers and armchair generals, of whom there are many here, who share their expertise on the situation between the pints in fact know very little about the situation and the realities of war.  There is not a word about Yemen when we tip-toe around Saudi Arabia.  When Saudi Arabia is not starving and bombarding children and babies in Yemen, it is taking a plastic bag and a chainsaw to an outspoken journalist.  We are most anxious that the State uses its position on the UN Security Council to do everything possible to de-escalate tensions and prevent military action or incursions.  We must also hit Putin and his oligarchs where it hurts, right in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  I know that one cannot butterfly or lollipop one's way out of a war.  We should remember that we are a neutral country.  We must use that neutrality to make sure that dialogue does not break down and that sense and peace prevail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300052#FFF01200","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645637520,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I wish to begin by welcoming the Ukrainian ambassador and expressing our deepest solidarity, on behalf of the Social Democrats and the people of Dublin Central who I represent, with the ambassador and the Ukrainian people today.  I cannot imagine what it is like to have the Russian Federation acting like a bully and a thug at the border, threatening violence on an immense scale.  We stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian people today.  That is what is happening.  The Russian Federation is behaving like a bully and a thug.  We have seen that on a relatively small scale in comparison with what the people of Ukraine are experiencing in terms of incursions into our airspace over the last number of years and the tracking of undersea fibre-optic cables.  We have seen what happened to our neighbours in the chemical terrorist attack in Salisbury.  This is a mafia that is designed to upset global order and is doing that in a multitude of different ways.  It is high time that the people on the global stage came together in solidarity to say: &quot;no more&quot;.<\/p><p>However, I do want to caution against the inevitability of war in terms of what the Irish response can, and should, only be.  We have an important role to play as a neutral country that has never invaded any country, as a member of the Security Council and as a neutral actor.  There is a difference between the rhetoric of conflict coming from the British Tory Government that seems to be posturing for conflict and is bullish in how it presents itself and has been for the last few months, and the behaviour of others in the EU, such as the French President, Mr. Macron, who are demonstrating other forms of leadership and are seeking diplomatic solutions.  That is what we need to be doing.  Right up until the very last moment, we need to be looking for diplomatic outcomes.  Dialogue must be at the very forefront of what we do and all the steps we take.<\/p><p>Difficult questions remain in relation to our response and in relation to what we do now that these bullies and thugs have encroached upon a sovereign European nation.  The difficult questions relate to our own complicity both as a European nation and as the Irish nation.  There are two challenging aspects of it.  The first is the idea of the need for unified sanctions.  The sanctions seem to be targeted at the Duma and at Putin's allies.  They need to be tough and hard.  I note that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister has called for sanctions.  I believe he stated that we need to hit them, hit them hard and hit them now.  That needs to be the approach.  There seems to be a belief both from the US and the EU that there can be a crescendo effect to sanctions.  The idea is that as the Russian Federation moves into independent territories, the sanctions increase a bit more, and if the Russian Federation takes more steps, the sanctions increase even further.  That approach will cost lives.  If there are going to be sanctions, they need to be targeted.  Sanctions must be fast, swift, prompt and severe.  We need to make the Russian Federation, and those who sustain it and prop up Putin, the pariahs of old.  We need to target them and hit them really hard.<\/p><p>The situation poses difficult questions for us.  Fintan O'Toole's article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday stated that &euro;118 billion was funnelled from the IFSC to entities linked to the regime of Vladimir Putin.  There are genuine questions as to our own complicity in this in terms of facilitating these shell companies to funnel money back into the regime.  There was talk of the Russian Federation's economy being the same size as Italy's.  That is in real terms.  We also know that the economy is far more vast than that and is built up by a network of oligarchs who fund these excursions and keep this power in place.  The only way we can challenge them is by hitting them where it hurts, which is in their pockets and in their access to power and influence.  We point to London too often when we talk about Russian money.  We cannot separate from our own complicity.  If they pull out of Russia, they are going to look to the IFSC, where they manipulate our own legal structures.  We need to close those loopholes.  I should think everyone believes we need to close them.  <\/p><p>There is also the point that we are complicit by our dependence on fossil fuels.  One of the most welcome moves yesterday was Germany's decision to close down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  Putin knows that Russia has Europe by the clutches because of our dependency on its gas and oil.  When previous wars happened, one of the things that happened was a ratcheting up of industrialisation and military industrialisation and the spend that goes with it.  Now there is an opportunity to see that we have a crisis of climate and complicity when it comes to empowering the Russian Federation.  As we move away from our dependency on fossil fuels, including gas and oil, we remove the power that this regime has over Europe.  We cannot seek to replace that by looking for the same two fossil fuels elsewhere.  The response of the EU must be investing in clean energy and removing ourselves from the dependency on Russia's gas, oil and coal.  I appreciate that in Ireland we are not as dependent as others are, but we are part of a European network.  That needs to be taken away from Russia.  I will conclude by stating that there still must be a space for diplomacy.  Our response must be to remember who we are and to strive, at all points, to avoid a conflict that will cost millions of lives.  Seeking diplomatic solutions must be our only approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300053#GGG00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1645637520,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I wish to acknowledge the presence of the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland and to express the solidarity of the Fianna F&aacute;il party with her and her people at this time, as I am sure the Minister of State has done already.It has come to pass, after months of speculation, that Russia has moved on Ukraine.  As we were warned all along, a pretext was engineered to give cover to Russia to recognise two breakaway regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, as independent states and to send in troops to be so-called peacekeepers.  There was increased shelling in the area and a plea for intervention by the pro-Russian leaders of both regions.  That was the pretext.  We must assume that this is just the start of it and that a full-scale invasion and annexation of Ukraine is still a real possibility.  This is a serious violation of international law.  It is an attack on the territorial integrity of Ukraine and it casts aside the Minsk agreements.<\/p><p>We need to examine what Russia has been up to immediately prior to the events of this week and also in recent years.  They say that the first casualty of war is the truth.  The Russians are certainly masters of propaganda.  In the past few weeks, Russia has been rubbishing claims that it was about to invade Ukraine.  It even accused western countries of being warmongers and of being the aggressor in respect of these tensions.  What are we to make of these statements now?  What has Russia been doing in recent years?  It annexed Crimea in 2014.  It gave its backing to the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, which has engaged in all sorts of hostile acts against the EU, and tramples on fundamental rights.  In 2018, there was the novichok nerve attack in Salisbury.  We must also look at how the Opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been treated.  Russia is closely linked to cyberattacks on several EU countries.<\/p><p>In a debate in the D&aacute;il on 26 June 2019, the then leader of the Opposition and current Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tYet again there have been attempts by one country to promote division, undermine the European Union and support extremists, primarily on the right but also on the left in some countries. <\/blockquote>  <p>He was, of course, referring to Russia, which utilised social networking platforms to peddle misinformation and engage in election interference, or information manipulation, as it were.  <\/p> <p>Russia considers the spread of liberal democratic values to be its biggest threat and has a major policy objective of undermining the EU.  We all need to be aware of this.  The stark reality is that just 6% of the world's population live in fully fledged democracies and that democracy is stagnant or in decline in many countries.  This is something of which we need to be conscious, as well as the role Russia is playing in this regard.<\/p> <p> Ireland has clearly stated that we fully support Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity and its right to choose its own foreign and security policy, and rightly so.  It certainly seems negotiation and diplomacy in this case have failed, at least so far.  I think in particular of the interventions by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, through the Normandy process.  Ireland should continue to press for a de-escalation and a diplomatic solution through our participation on the UN Security Council and at European Council meetings.  This is our role in international affairs.<\/p> <p> Of course, there must be sanctions too.  I welcome the sanctions proposed by the EU to date.  They are proportionate, but an increased package of sanctions on the Russian economy and individuals should also be imposed in the event of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  These sanctions will impact on the Irish economy and the EU economy as a whole; let us make no mistake about that.  It is significant that Germany has just cancelled the Nord Stream 2 gas project in response.  I know work is continuing on assessing the exposure of the Irish economy in the context of these sanctions.  They will hurt certain sectors and energy prices are sure to rise, but we have no choice.  We have to do the right thing.  We have to show solidarity and ask the question, \"What price democracy?\".  I welcome the fact the EU has given a financial package to Ukraine of &euro;1.2 billion.  Again, that is a show of solidarity by Europe and the EU in respect of our European neighbour.<\/p> <p> At the end of the day, as other speakers have stated, what we are looking at here is the potential for massive loss of life in the event of a full-scale invasion.  As the Minister stated earlier, there has been loss of life already.  That must be our primary concern.  Loss of life on the scale that would come about in the event of a full-scale invasion must be avoided.  War is not nice - far from it.  I reiterate the need to show solidarity with our Ukrainian neighbours at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300053#GGG00300","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645638120,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I welcome the Ukrainian ambassador to the Chamber.  We as politicians in this House stand in full solidarity with her country.  This building and its roof know better than any other place that every country has a full and unequivocal right to independence and not to be interfered with by any outside nation.  We stand in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine, both tonight and in the days and weeks that will follow.<\/p>  <p>  Before I came to the Chamber, I was flicking through television news channels and saw footage of Druzhkivka, a town in eastern Ukraine where children in school No. 1 Druzhkivka were being taken by their teachers from their classrooms and down a corridor into a bomb shelter as a drill exercise.  They used to have to do that drill exercise every few years; now it has become a feature of daily life in the school.  These are children of five or six years of age, probably in the equivalent of junior infants or senior infants.  I abhor what I saw on the news tonight.<\/p>  <p>  Vladimir Putin is the thug of the international schoolyard of geopolitics.  He is not bringing independence or peace; he is bringing war, death and suffering to these poor people, including children, in Druzhkivka and other small towns and villages in Ukraine.  The last time we saw something like this happen in Europe, eyes turned the other way and things were allowed to happen.  I am a lover of history and reading history books.  We know how this happened and manifested itself in the 1930s and 1940s.  It certainly did not stop in the neighbouring nations to Germany; they went and they went again.  Vladimir Putin is hell-bent on restoring the old imperial Russia.  He very much has his eyes on the nations that lie to the west of its international boundaries.<\/p>  <p>  In 2002, I had the great honour of studying in the Czech Republic while it was on its way to acceding to the European Union.  I studied central European studies and post-communism studies at Palack&yacute; University Olomouc.  The people of that country, those of Ukraine and those of central and eastern Europe have democratically chosen a pathway in recent years that involves looking westwards, looking towards the European Union and, for some nations, looking towards NATO.  That has to be respected.  They certainly did not choose to see Russian tanks or insurgents.  They did not choose to have Russian military troops taking off their patches, putting on balaclavas and pretending they are some sort of happy peace-keeping group coming in.  They are not.  They are an invading force and the nations of Europe and the world need to react as such.<\/p>  <p>  Through the years, all bullies become emboldened and push the boundaries more if there is a limp attitude towards them.  I have seen that limp attitude in recent weeks.  As we have turned on the television night after night, we have seen the European Union say it will wait and see what happens next; it will wait for Russia's next move; and it will wait to see if it invades further.  We even saw such an attitude in this country when we actually thanked the Russian ambassador for Russia carrying out ballistic test exercises beyond our exclusive economic zone.  We thanked him.  That is ludicrous.  We should be telling him where to go; not thanking him for moving further out with his vessels.  We have also seen it from Sinn F&eacute;in.  In 2015, when a Russian presence first began moving into Ukraine, there were sanctions at stake in the European Parliament but the Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs voted against those sanctions.  It is limp attitude after limp attitude.  That has only served to embolden Vladimir Putin to the point where tanks and troops are now crossing the border into other nations.  Many actors had a part to play in how we have reached this stage.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention Belarus.  At the moment, it is a puppet state with a dictator president.  Like many Members of the House, I have adopted a Belarusian political prisoner.  His name is Siarhei Hatskevich.  I want that on the record of the House.  He is 17 years of age.  He should be completing his final state examinations in high school this year.  Instead, he is spending his second year in prison.  He has missed the funerals of his father, his grandfather and his aunt.  A year ago, there were 180 Belarusian prisoners.  There are now 283.  These are people who were holding placards on the street; they are not people who took up guns and balaclavas to try to bring some moral authority to their streets.  These are people who are standing up for fundamental rights.  The political prisoner who was adopted by my colleague Deputy Haughey died in custody in suspicious circumstances.  We need to stand up time and again.  Let there be no more limp attitudes from Ireland, the European Union or western nations when it comes to Russian aggression.<\/p>  <p>  I received an email from Iryna Zaritska, a Ukrainian national living in my community.  She stated that the Ukrainian nation is very grateful to both the Irish people and Europe for amassing support and is against any military conflicts.  She stated that all Ukraine wants is to be a free, independent and strong European state.

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  We are in danger of living through a very expensive lesson in history if we do not have a strong and unified approach to the latest happenings in Ukraine.  My thoughts and prayers are with all Ukrainian citizens, given the recent escalated military tensions.<\/p>  <p>  Russia is in breach of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68\/262 which clearly recognises the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  There must be consequences.   We cannot have a situation like the one that exists in Palestine, where the Government of Israel is in breach of almost 50 UN resolutions.  Almost half of the country-specific resolutions have related to Israel.  What is good for the goose must be good for the gander.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland knows enough about the aggression of bigger states against smaller nations.  It is about time the interests of smaller nations were taken seriously.  Last month, our waters were to be used for war games in a \"Mine is bigger than yours; what are you going to do about it?\" manner.  It was unreal.  My colleague an Teachta Brady met the Russian ambassador to convey our views on such shenanigans.  This is what real leadership looks like.  All sides must work to de-escalate tension.  The fishermen and fisherwomen of Ireland showed more leadership than the Government did.  The Government must use diplomatic channels to ensure there is a peaceful resolution to what is a very tense situation.<\/p> <p>I note that the EU has been very strong in respect of the repercussions for Russia.  If Russia carries out military actions on Ukrainian territory, talk must be followed by action.  The truth is often the first victim of any conflict.  We must insist on balanced reporting that is backed up by facts and not by speculation.  <\/p> <p> Ordinary people are scared about the knock-on effects in Ireland.  Indeed, I overheard two schoolchildren on the Luas the other day wondering when Russia would invade us.  Many people have not even thought about how this sabre-rattling will affect fuel and food prices.  We all know that fuel and food poverty have increased significantly.  The Government must cancel or postpone the proposed carbon tax rises.

I think it is only right that she is here today as we discuss this issue.  We have to state plainly that Vladimir Putin is in breach of international law.  I see him, in a straightforward way, as the equivalent of the local drug dealer who gets away with burning down people&rsquo;s houses as leverage.  The question is whether he is going to burn down the whole street or is anyone going to bring him to book.  That is where we are at this point in time.  I have heard commentators say that he is not so much strategic as tactical and is determining this on a blow-by-blow basis.  We are all in the position of fearing the worst but hoping for the best.  We want to see peace.  All engagements that are necessary from the point of view of bringing about a diplomatic solution have to be done.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and the western powers must engage and have to impose sanctions.  This State has to look at itself because we must be clear.  Many people have suggested that the only way one is going to hurt this guy, and the oligarchs who surround him, is by hurting him in the pocket.  We cannot have the case where we have had &euro;118 billion funnelled through this State to Russia in the past number of years through the IFSC, with multiple devices and the use of shell companies.  That is not on in any way shape or form.  We know what we cannot and can do, so we have to do that piece.  We have to be on the positive side in this.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to bring up an issue that has been brought to my attention by a constituent from County Louth, Brendan Murphy, who is in Ukraine at this point in time with his family.  He has been given an instruction by the ambassador that it is a very dangerous situation.  I feel for everybody who is there.  Mr. Murphy states that he is not enabled to leave the state or country to come directly here because there are visa issues.

His military aggression in Ukraine is completely unacceptable and he should get his troops out.  There is no doubt about that and he should be roundly condemned.  This is not new for Putin or the Russian state.  It has a long history of treating its neighbouring countries as a prison house.  In fact, famously, tsarist Russia was the prisonhouse of nations and denied independence and self-determination to those nations.<\/p>  <p>  More recently we have seen the Russians commit horrors in Afghanistan, there was a horrendous war in Chechnya and we saw the Russian-dominated version of NATO sending troops into Kazakhstan to help the Kazakhstan Government put down a workers&rsquo; revolt against rising energy prices.  <\/p>  <p>  All or most of the people who are condemning what Putin is now doing never condemned what he did in Chechnya and Kazakhstan.  They are condemning what he is doing in Ukraine but not those things.  They are selective in their standards when it comes to Russian warmongering and, indeed, as many people have pointed out, many of the nations condemning him for what he is doing now are more than willing to launder Russian oligarch money in the IFSC or in the City of London.  <\/p>  <p>  We are, therefore, not going to go along with the one-sided double standards that have been deployed by many of the speakers in this debate because the people of Ukraine have the right to self-determination and territorial integrity.  Putin should get out.  To pretend that NATO has no responsibility for this and that they are somehow the good guys in all of this situation is to be utterly dishonest.  NATO has relentlessly expanded eastwards since the end of the Cold War, recruiting and moving 800 km eastwards and doing military exercises on an annual basis on the Russian border.  The Defender Europe exercises, which take place every year, involved 28,000 troops last year, including naval military exercises in the Black Sea.  That is also militarism.  That is military provocation.  These are two big military political blocs vying for spheres of influence.  My very strong advice to the people of Ukraine, from a country that is militarily neutral and that established itself as a State in opposition to the disaster of the First World War and to the oppression of empires, is not to align itself with NATO because it is a warmongering military alliance that is also headed up by military thugs.<\/p>  <p>  Have we forgotten what the United States did in Iraq?  We have the same justifications there.  Saddam Hussein was a dictator, absolutely.  He was a brutal murderer of his own population.  He was somebody who was willing to attack neighbouring countries.  All of this is true.  That was used by the United States to launch a war which was a disaster with 1 million people killed.  It was an utter disaster for the Middle East.  Does the hypocrisy of the United States continue?  It absolutely does.  As we speak, it is arming the Saudi regime, a brutal dictatorship, to the teeth, as it conducts a war in Yemen where tens of thousands of people are being killed.  <\/p>  <p>  We raise as an alternative to the banner of warmongering, and as an alternative to siding either with the thug that is Putin or the military-aggressive alliance which is NATO, the banner of internationalism and of opposition to war.  War or militarism will not solve the very dangerous conflict in Ukraine.  We need to oppose war and to build a movement of international solidarity against warmongering, whether it is from the thug Putin or from the NATO-US-dominated military alliance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300055#JJJ00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1645638720,"counter":553,"content":"<p>The same forces that gave the world a climate crisis and put profit before people in a pandemic - big corporations, oligarchs, the arms industry, dictators and right-wing politicians - are now bringing us the NATO-Russia stand-off.

NATO should withdraw from eastern Europe and Russian troops should be returned to barracks.  These forces offer nothing to the ordinary working people of Ukraine, Russia or the world.<\/p>  <p>  In Russia, patients recovering from serious illnesses are being turfed out of hospitals to make way for refugees.

The world is in a very difficult position and, clearly, we all have worries about war breaking out and families being destroyed and obliterated from the face of the earth.  It is unacceptable to all of us.  The Irish Government, the European Union, the United Kingdom and America are all speaking with one voice here - there must be an end to this unacceptable aggression.  It will have important and far-reaching effects on the world and, indeed, on the economy here.  I worry about the increase there is likely to be in energy costs and the impact that will have on the world economy, as well as the fact that interest rates are likely to go up sooner rather than later.  The great uncertainty at present is absolutely unacceptable.  The European Union knows well what the deficit may be in our energy supply.  We have to make every effort.  I presume that reassurances have been given to all the countries in Europe, Germany in particular, about an alternative supply of energy should the worst come to the worst.<\/p><p>One thing that concerns me is that when the Russians sent their warships adjacent to Irish waters recently it pointed to the serious deficit that exists in our military and defence capacity.  I fully support remaining neutral and retaining our neutrality and independence from all blocs, including NATO, and other forces, but we must have the appropriate and proper method to defend our country if a country invades our airspace or our waters to use it as a base for attacks on other countries that may be part of other alliances.  We must make sure in terms of the European Union that there is not a vector of attack, as it was described in one newspaper, where weaknesses can be strategically exposed and taken advantage of.  I know it is a different debate, but we must find the money and resources to ensure that we are fully and properly equipped to defend our airspace and waters in situations that might probably arise now.<\/p><p>Having listened to people talking about America and politicians, I can say one thing.  Thank God for Joe Biden, when one looks at what Trump has gone on the record as saying in the <i>New York Times<\/i>, which I have just read.  He said that Putin was very savvy and he was a genius by doing what he is doing and going into Ukraine.  When one talks about right-wing politicians, there is nobody more right wing than him that I am aware of.  We have to ensure that common sense and decency prevail.  What I very much like in the response of Joe Biden is the return to the involvement or concern that the United States has for the future of Europe and for our security.  I welcome the contacts he has had.  He has strong contacts with all the governments and particularly with the European Union.  We should all say in one united voice that Putin must withdraw and Ukraine must be allowed to decide, as it has, its own sovereignty and government.  Our support for its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and its right to choose its foreign and security policy path must be unwavering.<\/p><p>Finally, a Cheann Comhairle, I am a member of the Russian-Irish inter-parliamentary friendship group and we have met with the ambassador, Yury Filatov, a number of times over the last few years.  We have always found him prepared to listen to what we say.  However, the issue is that our relationships as parliamentarians cannot proceed unless and until there is a withdrawal.  That is my personal view, and I am glad to see you hopefully agreeing that we cannot further our relationship as parliamentarians.  I refer briefly to Anton Morozov, the former chairman of that group from the State Duma in Russia.  We met him and he attended here.  Unfortunately, however, that is the reality.  That is one way we can show our view as parliamentarians, and, hopefully, it will be the view of the Oireachtas.  We stand by Ukraine and we stand by world peace, not by dictatorship now or ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300056#KKK00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1645639320,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the ambassador and her colleagues.  These must be very difficult days for her, her family and her country.  It is respectful and good of her to be here with us this evening.<\/p>  <p>  As we reflect on how we got to where we are and where we may be in the coming days, hard questions need to be asked of ourselves as a country and of the EU.  Since 2015, there has been a pathway leading to where we are now.  In the last few weeks, in particular, I have been struck by how relatively irrelevant the EU institutions seemed to be, as President Macron, Chancellor Scholz, President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken all tried, and I must give them credit for having made that effort, to bring sense to this and try to get us away from the brink.  However, President von der Leyen and Mr. Borrell were quite absent in terms of taking initiatives or pushing forward an EU agenda, reliance or ambition in regard to the security of Ukraine.  That is not good.  Yes, I acknowledge there is a package of aid approved, but the notion is that it will then wait for an emergency summit, which has been called for tomorrow evening.  It is well past the time for having an emergency summit to discuss sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  The sanctions announced today are relatively minor.  The defence given is that they are minor in the context that there will be more.  When will there be more?  What more action do we need to know what the intent of the Russian President is?  In addition, the sanctions target MPs in the Russian State Duma, or whatever the equivalent is.  They do not target the president himself.  I am sure there is a logic to or a reason for that, but it is like telling every backbencher in this House that he or she is a target and the Government is not.  Those who make and enact the decisions are let away.  That is a flavour of it, and it is a flavour of my frustration.  The entire basis of the European Union is that we would not go back to where we were in World War Two.  It is the foundation on which everything it has done is based, yet here we are with a very serious situation once again on the Continent and the EU is behind the curve.  The EU has been behind the curve in terms of proactivity and dealing with this.<\/p>  <p>  Second, we all have to ask hard questions as to why the EU has become so dependent on Russia for energy since 2015.  That is why ordinary people will have to pay the price of this in the coming hours and days in terms of fuel costs and fertiliser costs, on top of so many other costs.  We must ask ourselves the hard questions there too.  Deputy O'Dowd was right when he referred to former President Trump, who cheerled Vladimir Putin throughout his term.  While that cheerleading was happening, it appeared that the Russian forces and Russian arrogance were building.  President Putin was getting more and more trenchant in his views of where Russia should go, yet there was very little opposition.  Very little effort was made to try to stop him, to try to put a halt to his ambition and to try to stop the situation that we have today arising.<\/p>  <p>  Hard questions have to be asked and we have to learn the lessons from that.  It is little consolation to the people of Ukraine who are facing such an uncertain time and uncertain future.  We also have to get serious about sanctions and stop faffing around, tinkering at the edges.  We are either serious or we are not.  That includes hard calls to be made in this country too, regarding banking and financial arrangements.  I know the Minister of State is engaged in the case, but I was struck by the small matters that make such a difference with regard to visa participation.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs on surrogacy to try to ease the burden.  There are other things that could also be done to assist our citizens there.<\/p> <p> We have to hope that tomorrow night's summit presents us with a new European Union attitude and determination based on strong action rather than hope.  Rather than words and wraps on the knuckles we hope it is based on something that means something and will change what may be an inevitable course.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and the Taoiseach need to tell the summit that 100 years on, a small republic crafted and created in opposition to a superpower of the day would stand up for other small republics and for the national aspirations of others, and would defend those aspirations, borders and people in the same way we looked to other countries throughout the world to defend us 100 years ago.  We are in the European Union but we are Irish and we have a proud history of standing up to oppressors.

For weeks we have seen the geopolitical battle between NATO and Russia being played out and the ordinary people of Ukraine getting caught in the middle.  It has received prime coverage from almost all Irish media.  On Monday night came the news from the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, that Russia had formally announced recognition of the two breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk.  Until then we had been watching the slow demise of the Minsk II agreement.  This agreement was mediated with great effort and diplomacy by France and Germany.  They brought all of the parties to the table.  They developed a resolution that gave hope for peace and stability in the region and the reintegration of the breakaway republics back into Ukraine.<\/p><p>Monday's announcement marked the death of the Minsk II agreement.  Now we seem further than ever away from that hope for peace and stability.  The reality is that NATO and its EU members will make sufficient financial gains from all of this instability.  The military-industrial complex has seen a steady increase in the value of its stocks and shares since the crisis began.  Millions upon millions worth of lethal arms produced in Europe are flooding into Ukraine.  Much of this will end up in the hands of far-right paramilitaries who have no desire for peace.<\/p><p>Recently An T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, carried out a trade mission to Saudi Arabia.  It should be noted the Saudi Arabian Government is one of the biggest clients for European arms, with EU arms purchased by Saudi Arabia frequently ending up in war-torn regions.  The brutal war that has been prosecuted on the Yemeni people by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is too often forgotten by the EU.  Tens of thousands of Yemeni men, women and children have been killed or maimed by bombs and bullets supplied by EU governments.  Where is the outcry against Saudi Arabia?  Where are the sanctions and arms embargoes?  How do arms sales to Saudi Arabia help EU defence and security?  They do not.<\/p><p>We need to see the EU follow the example set by the UN in the 1970s in the fight against apartheid.  Ireland needs to be a leading voice in the EU for an urgent arms embargo on the apartheid state of Israel.  Last week, unarmed 19 year old Nehad Barghouti was shot dead at a protest by the Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank.  Only last night we heard of a 14-year-old child being murdered by Israeli apartheid occupation forces.  The soldiers stripped the child naked and prevented ambulances from reaching him, letting him die on a pavement in the West Bank.  Between 2015 and 2020 Germany exported more than &euro;1 billion worth of arms to Israel and Italy exported more than &euro;300 million worth of arms to Israel.  Last year, Israel's 11 day military campaign killed at least 253 people, including 66 children in Gaza.  How many of these 253 men, women and children were killed by EU weapons?  How long will the EU stay silent while EU member states make large profits selling weapons to this apartheid state?<\/p><p>When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 we saw a suite of sanctions and embargoes on Russia.  Our view on sanctions is very <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>.  To quote the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in June 2021 he said the boycott of Israeli goods would be counter-productive.

How can it be claimed that Ireland is a neutral state when it stands by and watches Palestine burn while Ireland calls for the introduction of sanctions on Russia?

I welcome the Ukrainian ambassador, Larysa Gerasko, and her wonderful team to the Chamber.  I hope they feel welcome because they certainly are.  My views on the Ukrainian-Russian conflict and crisis are well-known at this stage from previous contributions on Leaders' Questions prior to and since Christmas and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  There is no point in me repeating what I have already said.  Unfortunately my concerns have come to light and we are now most likely looking at the largest conflict in Europe since the Second World War about to break out.  Coupled with that will be the largest humanitarian catastrophe in living memory on this continent.  Unfortunately this seems to be the direction of travel at present.<\/p>  <p>  I will not use my time to retrace my steps.  I will focus on two groups of Irish people who regularly get forgotten and who are in Ukraine at present.  The first group is our wonderful team at the Department of Foreign Affairs who were in the embassy in Kyiv.  They have been there for nine months, since the embassy opened last June.  I pass on my respect and admiration to the ambassador, Therese Healy, and her team.  It was absolutely the correct decision for our embassy to remain on location with the other EU 27 member states rather than to withdraw.  It is exactly the way it should have been.  However, I am not convinced we have made the optimum security and safety arrangements for the protection of the team there.  I would be grateful to hear the thoughts of the Minister of State in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the foreign embassies in Dublin have a very small security detachment on location to protect the premises and the people and to protect secure communications and sensitive documentation.  This is entirely their prerogative.  After all, it is their sovereign national territory.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Foreign Affairs have an excellent relationship.  They even share the same Minister at this stage.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Foreign Affairs have deployed together in the past, to the embassy in Freetown, Sierra Leone and in Nigeria.  It is something that should be considered in this instance because of the hostile nature of where they are based.  What a very small discreet Defence Forces team could bring to the table is it could deploy with armoured Toyota land cruisers rather than the soft skin vehicles there at present.  It could also provide security and contingency planning for evacuation.  Most important, it could provide medical backup in the event of things going wrong.  We have seen the amount of jamming and cyberattacks at present.  It could provide secure communications back to Iveagh House or Defence Forces headquarters.  This is something that should be considered if it has not been already.  I will leave that in the capable hands of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The second group of people I want to mention are the 11 Irish citizens seconded to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  I am glad the Minister made reference to it earlier.  These are fantastic people.  They are completely unarmed.  They have been based there for several months.  Some of them have been based there for a couple of years.  A number of them are based in the Donbas region on both sides of the line of separation.  I mention this for several reasons.  Other Deputies in the House quite rightly raised the fact there is a lot of disinformation and propaganda flowing around.  It is very important to have people on location providing impartial objective verification of information.  It is also important that our people out there should be supported.  There are employment contract irregularities associated with the 11 people out there.  They received verbal commitments in the past on a stipend from the Department of Foreign Affairs but it has yet to be delivered.  It is important these wonderful people are not out of pocket for the exceptionally challenging, difficult and vital work they are doing.<\/p>  <p>  I utterly condemn the conduct, behaviour and activities of the Russian military in and around Ukraine, particularly in recent days.  I very much note and respect the restraint shown by the Ukrainian authorities.<\/p> <p>I hope that dialogue, diplomacy and deterrence wins out but I fear that we have passed the point of no return and that we are heading towards conflict.

I welcome the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, and her colleagues here this evening.  I offer my full support to the Ukrainian people at this extremely difficult and worrying time.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation in Ukraine had deteriorated rapidly over the last days.  The action of Russia and its President Putin is causing great concern, not only to the citizens in Ukraine but to all of us in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken with many Ukrainian nationals who reside in my constituency.  It is clear from speaking with them that they are greatly worried for their home country and their many friends and families there.  Surely, if history has taught us anything it is that war is not the lasting solution.  I acknowledge the efforts of our Government as part of the wider EU effort to find a diplomatic solution, but it is clear to see that Putin has his mind made up on the course of action he intends to take.  This, unfortunately, looks like military action, a course that nobody wants.<\/p>  <p>  It is important now that the EU and its counterparts continue to try to reach a diplomatic solution.  I agree with and support the calls by the Taoiseach yesterday, when he called on Russia to de-escalate and withdraw his military forces from the Ukrainian border.  As the Taoiseach stated, the action of Russia is clearly a violation of international law and a breach of Ukraine's sovereignty.  The bottom line is that those actions breach fundamental principles of the UN Charter, which clearly states that all member states must refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or the political independence of any state.  What Russia is currently engaged in clearly breaches this UN charter.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that Ireland stands in solidarity with Ukraine.  As I said earlier, I have spoken with a number of Ukrainian nationals who reside in my constituency in the town of Dundalk.  While they are extremely worried about the current situation, it is also clear that they are willing to defend their rights.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, clarify what actions are being taken to protect Irish nationals who are currently in Ukraine?  We certainly do not want a situation where they are caught on the hop if the circumstances deteriorate any further and they are left stranded.  Will the Minister of State give an update on this?  Will he outline exactly what actions the Irish Government intends to take so that Irish nationals in Ukraine are safe?  What are the measures in place to ensure their rapid evacuation if needed?<\/p>  <p>  In its response yesterday the EU quickly imposed sanctions on Russia, which I support fully.  The only question I would raise is around the so-called \"Russian funds\" being channelled through Ireland.  This was referred to last night on RT&Eacute;, and it was suggested that the vast majority of this money, which apparently is channelled through the financial systems in Ireland, comes from dubious sources.  If this is the case, the Irish Government must take swift and decisive action in this regard.  We cannot have a situation whereby Russian money is laundered through Ireland's financial system.  It would leave Ireland in a position where on the one hand we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and with our EU neighbours, and on the other hand our financial system is being used to launder Russian money.  I ask the Minister of State to also look into that.  I call on the Government to make a statement in relation to this, and to confirm the actions it intends to take to stop this.<\/p>  <p>  I offer my full support to the Ukrainian people at this extremely difficult and worrying time.  I encourage all sides to pursue the diplomatic process that will result in a long-term peaceful solution.  We on this island, no more than most, know that war and violence does not lead to a lasting solution, only heartache and bitterness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300058#MMM00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1645640520,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of the Ukrainian diplomats and their ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko.  They are welcome to the House.<\/p>  <p>  It is appalling to see what is happening in the sovereign state that is Ukraine.  I have had the good fortune of meeting many members of the Ukrainian community.  I had my first interaction with people who were not from Ireland when in primary school.  I went to a small rural school of just 39 pupils.  It was my first interaction with people who were not born and raised in Ireland.  I have very fond memories of meeting people from the Ukrainian community in Ireland in my career in politics to date.  They are a very proud people.  They care very deeply about their culture, which is diverse.  They speak different languages, which many people might not be aware of.  It is important to say in this House that the people of Ireland have a great appreciation for the importance Ukraine's place in the world.  What is happening is absolutely abhorrent, with Ukrainian sovereignty being tested by the Russians.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for Ireland, as a small independent country that fought extraordinarily hard for independence, to stand up for the rights of every single democracy no matter where they are in the world, when they are being threatened for absolutely no reason at all.<\/p>  <p>  This week I went to Clonmult with Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann and An Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, where we saw just what type of struggle our own people went through to get their freedom.  It was a freedom that was hard fought.  The freedom of the people of Ukraine is being challenged, and in today's world, in the 21st century and in the new millennium, it is absolutely appalling that they are being treated in such a fashion.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to make the important point to the House that we should learn lessons from what is happening in the Ukraine.  It is extremely concerning from a security point of view, not alone for us in the Republic of Ireland, but also for the European continent.  We need to evaluate our own security and how safe we are as a people.  I would encourage all Irish citizens who are still in the Ukraine to immediately seek a degree of safety, whether they return to the Republic of Ireland or make contact with the embassy.  I commend the work the Department of Foreign Affairs and the different Ministers in that Department are doing.  It is not easy work, but it is important to make that point in the House.  It is not something we often discuss.  We must also acknowledge the work we are undertaking in the United Nations through our ambassador in the UN.  The UN Security Council met on a number of occasions, in particular the other night, to discuss the latest developments in that situation.<\/p>  <p>  What is happening is outrageous in the sense of territorial claims being made and attempts to form new countries.  We should completely and utterly reject this as a sovereign and independent democracy.  It is important to say that.  Speaking as a young person, it is fair to say that the people of Ukraine have an extremely bright future ahead of them if it is allowed to succeed and prosper in its own right.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been enormous progress in terms of the development of Ukraine as a country, and successes lay ahead for it until this incident took place.  Ireland, as a neutral country, is obviously in a very unique position.  Unlike many of our European neighbours, which are members of NATO, the Republic of Ireland, as a neutral country, is able to stand on its own two feet and say to the Ukrainian people that it commits to protect democracies, no matter where they are in the world, that it values human life and that it places a value on freedoms for people to make their own choices and live the lives they wish to live.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to add my own two cent as a Deputy from Cork.  There are many people in my constituency and in my county with strong connections to Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  From a defence point of view, it is unacceptable that in the Haulbowline Naval Service base, which is in my constituency, two ships are tied up there at the moment with the threat of a third being tied up.  From a security point of view, we must take urgent action to protect our own sovereignty.  We are a small independent nation that could potentially be vulnerable to future incursions.  Recently, we saw what the Russians are capable doing.  An absolutely unacceptable incident took place off the coast of Ireland.  Although it was outside our sovereign territory, it was within our exclusive economic zone.  It is important that Ireland invests and has the ability to detect what is in Irish airspace.  We do not have that ability currently if airplanes turn off their transponders.  It would also ensure optimal conditions in the Defence Forces so that people would want to stay in and have careers in the Defence Forces.  The pride people have working for the Defence Forces is something I have noted when canvassing.  We should invest in the Defence Forces' future to ensure our own safety.<\/p>  <p>  From a peacekeeping point of view, I hope that some resolution is found in Ukraine so that we can avoid bloodshed.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to be going in that particular direction.  My calls may fall on deaf ears, considering the position I am in.  However, it is important that Russia takes stock of what it is doing and how it will impact on the view the world has of Russia in the future and that it withdraws its troops immediately from Ukrainian territory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300058#MMM00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1645640520,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I welcome the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, to the House.<\/p>  <p>I would like to welcome the comments of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the opening of the debate.  It was a strong speech which outlined the solidarity he, the Government and the House have with Ukraine at this time.  I welcome the unity and solidarity expressed by Members across the Chamber.  <\/p> <p> At the outset, I want to make the distinction that the Russian people are not Putin and Putin is not the Russian people.  That distinction is critically important and we should be very clear about that.  A war on the borders of the European Union and in cyberspace, a war on a sovereign state and a war on democracy itself is starting to play out.  It is as sombre an occasion as events in the early 1910s or 1930s or, indeed, the events of the Cold War of the latter half of the 20th century.  <\/p> <p> It is worthwhile reiterating in this Chamber that the West has not goaded Putin into war.  The Russian President has often invoked the NATO threat as justification, but this week he clearly laid out his actual grievances for lost power and influence.  Let there be no mistake.  This is a war initiated by Putin on a sovereign and independent state.  Putin has always feared successful democracies, in particular flourishing, sovereign and independent states following the fall of the USSR.  <\/p> <p> We need to be prepared, I am sad to say, for a humanitarian crisis caused by an autocratic regime, and we need to be willing to play our part.  My colleague on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Cathal Berry, has repeatedly emphasised the need to support the Ukrainian people, as he did just a few minutes ago.  He stated that we often think we have little control over geopolitical events, but we have control over our preparation and our response.<\/p> <p> Sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union this week, and the swiftness of those sanctions, are to be welcomed.  We are likely going to need further and more severe sanctions as we go forward.  I note Deputy Howlin is in the Chamber, and I want to acknowledge his efforts in bringing forward the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020, which completed Second Stage in the House last year.  It would strengthen our defence against Russian oligarchs who are laundering money in this country.  This Government should seriously consider supporting Deputy Howlin's Bill.  <\/p> <p> Reference was made earlier to Nord Stream 2 and the cancellation of the project yesterday.  It was the correct decision by Chancellor Scholz.  It will cause hardship for the European Union and lead to an elevation of energy prices across member states, but this is the price of solidarity.  It is the price of upholding democracy and sovereign integrity.  <\/p> <p> Deputies mentioned the longer term solution, and I have spoken many times in the House about how the west of the European Union can provide the energy for Europe so that it is not relying on the autocratic regime to the east.  I have spoken about it in terms of the opportunity that it represents for Ireland, but it is an opportunity for Europe to unravel itself from dependence on the Russian state.<\/p> <p> War and violence should never be glorified.  They result in death and destruction, families divided and a long legacy of trauma.  Democracy is fragile and must be shored up by our institutions, by our media and in this House.  We must avoid misinformation and polarisation on the critical issues of our day.  However, democracy can be resilient when people unite with a common purpose.  Years of sustained and unrelenting pressure from Putin has not broken Ukrainian democracy.  With true and effective solidarity and unity, I do not believe he will succeed this time either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300058#MMM00400","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645641120,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I again welcome the Ukrainian ambassador, H.E.

Like it or lump it, we are influenced economically by our relationship with Russia.  Some 30% of global wheat, 30% of barley and 20% of corn exports come from Russia and Ukraine.  This produce comes through the Black Sea and is transported down the Danube.  It can only come through without conflict.  Russia is the largest fertiliser exporter in the world, accounting for 25% of global nitrogen, 20% of global potash and 16% of global phosphate exports.  Russia supplies 40% of Europe's natural gas and 30% of Russia's crude oil is exported.

We had debates here all day on putting a mini budget in place to help our farming community, so that we can survive if there is a shortage of food.

I am shocked to hear some voices in this D&aacute;il talk about the outbreak of a third world war or words to that effect.  We should be raging against any possibility of war.  We should be using our voice as a neutral country, which is a powerful voice that has long been recognised and given respect because we have carried out our role as an independent, neutral country with integrity and as part of UN missions.  I have listened to the debate in my office and in here.  I am truly horrified as a woman, mother and female Deputy at the casual acceptance of war.  I do not want to waste my time giving my opinion of Putin.  I am on the record about it.  He is a dictator with no respect for democracy.  NATO's role in all of this has already been outlined by some colleagues on the left, but certainly not on the right.  NATO has played a despicable role in moving forward to the border and engaging in warmongering.  Ireland has been hypocritical on many levels.<\/p>  <p>  I will address a positive matter.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, called for us to focus on dialogue and diplomacy.  I hope he does that and I will fully support him.  I do not want war.  The casual manner in which history is being described here is totally inaccurate.  War does not solve anything.  Perhaps women might begin to say, out loud, \"Not in our name,\" and \"Peace in our name.\"  Women and children suffer the most.  There was rightly outrage about the Russian military being in our waters.  It was not matched by outrage about NATO exercises in our waters, to which we turned a blind eye.  We turned a blind eye to the blatant breach of international law by Israel against Palestine and to Yemen and Saudi Arabia's role there, which Ireland colluded with.  I will take no lectures from any male Deputy in this Chamber about standing up and seeing the reality.  I know the reality.  I have read everything I can get and looked at every possible document about war.  It solves nothing.  I stand firmly with Ukraine.  What it is facing is unimaginable.

I passed on my best wishes to them, their family and all Ukrainians.  All I can offer to the ambassador and her colleagues are my words, but they are sincerely and strongly spoken.  This House, representing the Irish people, is overwhelmingly supportive of the right of Ukrainian people to self-determination and territorial sovereignty.  We repudiate the idea that any state, through force of arms or cyberattacks, can attempt to extend its sphere of influence beyond its borders.  We will not accept that powerful states can attempt to control their smaller neighbours.<\/p>  <p>  The current situation has come about because those who sees themselves as strong men or hard men want to reverse the historical change that has taken place over the past 100 years, especially the historical changes in Ukraine leading up to 2013, culminating in Euromaidan in 2014.  I must admit that it was only when, as an MEP, I visited Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland that I got some sense of their legitimate security concerns and how aware they are of the lessons of history.

H.E. Larysa Gerasko and her colleagues are very welcome.  The ambassador represents the second largest country in Europe, which is often forgotten in the debates that we have.  It is a country of more than 40 million people and is second in size to Russia.  It has been heartening to hear the widespread support for Ukraine in the statements today.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney said, the support in the D&aacute;il and indeed in the Oireachtas is a reflection of the support for the Ukrainian people in Irish society.  I am conscious that people across the country are following the issue closely, learning more about Ukraine, and are looking closely at our statements.<\/p> <p>We in Ireland have a privilege that not everyone in the world enjoys, that is, the privilege to live in a free society and a democracy.  The Chamber in which we speak is the realisation and symbol of that free society.  The privilege comes with a duty too, that is, a duty to maintain democracy.  Every generation must recognise and meet that duty.  The continuance of democracy cannot be guaranteed passively or taken for granted.  In 2019, not so long ago, we in the D&aacute;il celebrated our House's centenary.  Many of the Members here will remember the sense of pride with which this institution marked the D&aacute;il100 commemoration.  It was a landmark moment for the nation and a reminder to us as Deputies, elected by the people, that we have a particular role as stewards of democracy.  Our freedom was hard-won.<\/p> <p> To those who say we should be doing more at the United Nations, I suggest they watch the speech of our ambassador to the United Nations, Geraldine Byrne Nason, who does us proud every day of the week on the United Nations Security Council, in which she reminded everybody around that table that we support the rights of Ukraine to its territorial integrity and an independent foreign policy because we fought hard for those rights.  That is why we have a seat on the Security Council.  This is not a question of military neutrality or a question of NATO; it is a very simple question of right or wrong, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.  As defenders of democracy, we cannot be concerned with only our own country.  Deputy O'Donoghue set out the interconnectedness of the world.  Democracy must be stood for as well.<\/p> <p> I have worked extensively with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach on relations with the EU's eastern neighbourhood.  We have seen the immense challenges Ukraine has faced due to external pressures.  These include cyberattacks, of which we have our own experience, and the attempted interference and threatening military posture of Russia.  Russia has an unprecedented number of troops completely encircling Ukraine, including in Belarus.  I urge those who blame NATO to go and look in the face of any of my colleagues or any politician from any of the Baltic states or from any of the countries neighbouring Russia.  Deputy Connolly mentioned men warmongering.  I urge her to listen to the Prime Minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas, an incredible woman who has spoken out not only for peace but also for the security of her country, which is threatened all the time.  Estonians live in fear of that threat because they have experienced it time and time again.<\/p> <p> Ukraine, like Ireland, has had a hard-won independence.  It has also had a hard-won path to establishing itself as a sovereign democracy free from foreign interference.  Yet it has stuck stubbornly to that choice, no matter what is thrown at it, and the people of Ukraine have increasingly supported democracy, the rule of law and possible membership of the European Union.  If you talk to the people of Ukraine and consider the relevant opinion polls, as we have seen reported in the press, you will find they support NATO.  Ireland has decided not to join NATO.  That is our sovereign choice.  Equally, it is the sovereign choice of the Ukrainians to join NATO if that is what they want to do.<\/p> <p> Last summer I participated virtually in the Ukraine Reform Conference, which analysed Ukraine's reform work in detail.  We have seen the incredible work to which Ukraine has committed itself in pursuing a reform process in recent years to establish stronger institutions and better societal resilience.  As envisaged in its association agreement with the EU, which was opposed by the main opposition group in the European Parliament and opposed in the D&aacute;il in a motion, real reforms have been made towards strengthening the rule of law, despite strong efforts on the part of vested interests to undermine it.  Despite external aggression that has been ongoing since 2014, the Ukrainian people have never backed down in their will to strengthen their democracy and to build strong institutions.  They have refused to be intimidated in the defence of their sovereignty, their democracy and their freedom.  They know that, like in Ireland, economic and social progress derive from our democracy and our commitments to the rule of law.<\/p> <p> I thank the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland and our ambassador in Ukraine.  Deputy Berry made a fair point that we should be very concerned for our people in Ukraine.  We have diplomats and other people working in Ukraine and in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  There are detailed plans to evacuate staff if that becomes necessary.  We are ensconced with the EU mission in Ukraine and we have had discussions as to how staff would be evacuated.  They need to be there today, however.  There is work to be done.  Many Irish citizens are still there.  They are urged to leave if they can.  Our diplomats, however, continue to work and to give service to the Irish people there and to further relations between Ukraine and Ireland.<\/p> <p> Belarus was mentioned.  Our Government and our Parliament have shown strong support for the cause of democracy there too.  The Government and the Oireachtas were proud to welcome Ms Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to Ireland last year to discuss Belarus's situation.  Developments in Belarus have been worrying.  More than 30,000 Russian troops are now stationed in Belarus.  They arrived ostensibly for joint military exercises, which do happen there from time to time, but they did not leave when the drills were completed.  Now the Belarusian defence ministry alleges that the increased military activity in the Donbas and near the borders of the so-called union state of Russia and Belarus justifies keeping forces in Belarus.  The people of Belarus did not ask for this and did not agree to any unification with Russia, and we certainly do not recognise such a union.  The Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, put out a recent statement that Belarus is being drawn into a foreign war and turned into an aggressor country.  Alexander Lukashenko is moving ahead with a constitutional referendum this Sunday, which will be profoundly anti-democratic and will show contempt for his own people and his disregard for peace and security.<\/p> <p> I had the opportunity to represent Ireland at last year's ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Stockholm.  That meeting was an eye-opener for me.  I was present at a meeting at which the Russian foreign minister had a long engagement with his Ukrainian and American counterparts and, strangely enough, his Norwegian counterpart.  Norway is a very strong country in support of peace as well.  The meeting certainly opened my eyes.  In conversations I had with the Ukrainian foreign minister back in early December, it was clear to me that Ukraine was very worried about this period in February.  The OSCE remains a unique and crucial platform for security co-operation in Europe, with the value-adding capability of maintaining dialogue on security issues between all parties in the region.  The OSCE special monitoring mission to Ukraine, the largest OSCE presence in the region, has made an important contribution in eastern Ukraine over the years.  The Government believes that the OSCE is the appropriate forum at which to discuss the European security architecture, inclusive of all 57 participating states of the OSCE.<\/p> <p> Peace is a choice.  War is a choice.  This D&aacute;il, I have no doubt, makes the choice for peace.  It is important we send a clear message from this Chamber that peace is always possible and that it is always possible to draw back from the brink and to choose peace.  Ireland has learnt the hard way the lesson of peace on this island.  The Irish Government and our European partners at EU level, at OSCE level and on the UN Security Council will continue to pursue the path of peace and to call on the leadership of the Russian Federation to do the same.

As I said on Committee Stage, we hear the commitments from the Minister to publish the Clinch report at the end of quarter 1.  There is a big question mark over that.  It is subject to approval by the Attorney General.  There is a further commitment to deliver the substantive legislation that has been called for across the political spectrum.  Again, there is a huge question mark over that in terms of its being subject to approval by Cabinet.<\/p> <p> There are clear weaknesses in marine casualty investigation in Ireland.  This was the legislation that could have resolved it.

I refer in particular to Michael Kingston, who is also a bereaved family member in relation to Whiddy Island. <\/p><p>The catalogue of repeated failures is disturbing.  The Whiddy Island disaster in 1979 should have focused minds.  The <i>Herald of Free Enterprise<\/i>disaster was in 1987, when the independent marine accident investigation unit was set up.  That template emerged there.  In 1998, the report of the investigation of marine casualties policy review group recommended international best practice.  It did not happen.<\/p><p>It is a serious matter that the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Lacey report of 2010 was revealed through a whistleblower when it should have been published by the Minister's Department long ago.  That recommended a multinodal accident investigation office to cover air, marine and rail, like the Swedish model.  It was not acted upon.  That has led to a complaint being sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by Michael Kingston.  This could not be more serious.  The complaint alleges that these failures have led unnecessarily to lives being lost at sea.<\/p><p>In 2020, there was a humiliating judgment in Europe.  There is huge expense again and again and failure by the Department to ensure a truly independent board.  The Captain Clinch report still has not been published.  Reports have repeatedly not been published or acted upon.  It is failure after failure.<\/p><p>The Minister is asking us to take a leap of faith and trust the Department responsible for that widespread catalogue of failure.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, said, our party cannot support this.  I am our fisheries and marine spokesperson and I tell the Minister that we believe this is disrespectful and represents part of the catalogue of examples I could give that demonstrate the lack of respect.<\/p><p>There are only two island states in the European Union, namely, Ireland and Cyprus.  We should have a proper process that protects families and provides training, support and protection to those at sea, whether involved in leisure or fisheries.  Michael Kingston has been assisting the families of Gerry Doherty and Thomas Weir, who died tragically in Donegal.  I have profound concerns about the findings in that regard.  Michael Kingston and others say that, had there been the necessary training and support for people who go to sea, those lives did not have to be lost.  I could give many other examples.<\/p><p>This was an opportunity for the Minister to do something comprehensive.  In the pre-legislative scrutiny provided, there was an offer to draft legislation using templates from international best practice.  As it happens, the Minister had draft legislation from the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Lacey report all those years ago.  That was just buried and not acted upon.  A complaint has gone to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I think rightly.  The Minister needs to oversee a review of how the hell that was not implemented at the time and why it did not appear among the other manifestations that come towards this legislation.<\/p><p>The Minister is asking people to take a leap of faith but people have lost faith in how the Department of Transport has handled this over the years.  It could not be more serious.  We will oppose this Bill.  We see it as a missed opportunity by the Minister to get this right with many people offering in good faith to assist.<\/p> <p>The Minister will have seen that from the transcript of the committee meeting and he will have seen the offers available there.  Whatever way he deals with this tonight, it is necessary for him to move towards a model based on what is in place in Sweden.  I refer to what was recommended all those years ago, in 2010, in the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Lacey report.  All these endeavours must come under the one roof and there must be total independence, which people can have faith in.  When tragedies happen, and sadly they do happen, we must learn lessons from them and try to not repeat those mistakes again.  Unfortunately, there is a catalogue and a chronology of failure here that the Minister must get his head around.  Whatever way he deals with this tonight, he needs to go away and then come back with proper legislation containing a completely independent system that will give people faith that mistakes will not be repeated when tragedies happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300062#QQQ01000","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645643520,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I am also greatly disappointed with what we are being asked to vote on tonight.  It is hard to believe that we are an island nation, because it would have been thought that this would have been one of the things we would have got right.  It was not that long ago that we had a debate here on the loss of marine helicopter R116.  That report was clear about its intention.  It set out not to apportion blame, but to learn lessons and to save lives in future.  Every investigation should be about that.<\/p>  <p>  Much of this context predates the Minister's time.  That is why there was a greater expectation that he would do things differently.  This legislation started out with an EU directive in 2009, which we were meant to transpose by 2011.  We were to have investigations that were independent.  It is not a big ask for them to be genuinely independent.  In 2015, the European Commission sought clarity.  We had the audacity to challenge that in 2016, and to more or less say that we were not infringing in this regard.  The European Commission argued that the make-up of the board did not constitute it being independent.<\/p>  <p>  Many things missing from this legislation have been identified in those two reports.  It is astonishing that reports which do chart the way have not been made available.  What was the point of compiling those reports if we are not going to learn from the information contained in them?  The Minister needs to tell us whether the report is going to be published at the end of the month.  What would preclude it from being published?  We should be looking at best international practice in the context of this legislation, but that is not what we are getting.  We are getting a tick-box approach.  We are just about in compliance, in theory, but we must be in compliance in practice, because that will make the difference in respect of learning lessons when accidents happen and in preventing them from happening in future.<\/p>  <p>  We do regulation poorly.  We do it in a fragmented and disjointed way.  We think we save money by not having good regulatory organisations in place.  In fact, we end up paying a price in the end.  In this case, it may well be seafarers who end up paying the price.  Often, though, we end up paying the price, in the context of compensation and things like that, because we have not done regulation well.  I do not know when the penny will drop in this respect.  It is not a situation unique to this aspect or this legislation.  It is a general feature of how we do things.  We must start learning lessons, take the bull by the horns and do this right.  We should do this once and do it right.  I would have thought that is what we would have been aiming to do here.  It is disappointing that what we are doing instead is pushing into the future something that could be done now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300063#RRR00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1645643520,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I do not agree with this legislation.  I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board with this half-baked Bill in order to try to get it right.  The Whiddy Island disaster happened 42 years ago.  I suppose I am the only Deputy who was unfortunate enough to see what happened that night.  I was 11 years old and standing on our doorstep 20 miles away, west of Schull, and looking at the ball of fire in the sky.  It was a ball of fire in the sky that could not be described.  There were no mobile phones and poor contact at times.  Visitors were at our house with my father.  A gentleman with them went as far north as was possible to see where the fire was coming from.  No matter how far north they travelled, it still was ahead of them.  That was 42 years ago, when a massive explosion occurred on the French oil tanker and took the lives of 51 people.<\/p>  <p>  We recently heard a radio documentary called \"Fire in the Sky\", which caused many people to relive that night.  It is well known now that no rescue took place because of the catastrophic safety failures and the regulatory system in place in the run-up to the disaster was appalling.  The Irish, French and British families concerned have had to live with this, together with the fallout afterwards.  There has been no resolution.  Throughout this horrendous ordeal for the families over the last 42 years, the State has never apologised to them for the appalling failures in the administration of justice and in implementing regulation.<\/p>  <p>  We are back to this topic again tonight.  Some 42 or 43 years on, we are still going to make the same mistakes.  The only thing the Minister might be able to do, seeing as he is not going to put the legislation right, is to talk to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and perhaps consider apologising to the families affected by the Whiddy Island tragedy.  Perhaps the Minister might meet members of the French-Irish Association of Relatives and Friends of the Betelgeuse group to help them in their goal to have the High Court change the victims' death certificates to a finding of unlawful deaths.  Michael Kingston has been mentioned several times tonight.  It is no wonder.  Not only has he fought a major battle regarding the Whiddy Island disaster to rectify the wrongs done there, but he has also fought bravely for other people in a voluntary capacity.  That must be commended.<\/p>  <p>  I will apologise to those families if the members of the Government fail in their duty to do so as the leaders of this country.  I refer to the Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach.  I will apologise to the families.  Perhaps the biggest apology needed is in the context of sitting down with the families and myself and have a meaningful conversation.  Perhaps we could all do the same thing and apologise to Mr. Kingston and the families.  I had family who died that night in the Whiddy Island disaster.  It is a tragic story that can be told, as are the stories of the other 50 people who died that night.  It is sad to think that 42 years later these people can still find no justice, as I see it, in this legislation as it is.  I plead with the Minister to take a step back, if for no other reason than out of respect for these people and to try to see if we can right the wrong here.  I have no doubt that Michael Kingston, with his expert knowledge in this field, would certainly help the Government with this legislation, if it were to go through later.  I refer to ensuring that proper investigations can take place and proper legislation is in place for that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know if the Minister is going to withdraw the Bill.  I do not think he will, but I certainly ask him to do so.  Equally, I ask him to talk to the T&aacute;naiste and to the Taoiseach - and I raised this issue here some months back as well - and issue an apology to these families.  That is the least the State can do after this much time.  Many of these people have been waiting for this apology.  Agonisingly, they lost loved ones that night off Bantry Bay.  It is a disaster that will never be forgotten in the memories of the people of west Cork<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300063#RRR00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1645643520,"counter":596,"content":"<p>As nobody else is indicating, I call the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300063#RRR00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1645643520,"counter":597,"content":"<p>It is important tonight that we remember all the families of those who died in the Whiddy Island disaster, which I remember, and in every disaster since when people have lost their lives at sea.  It is such an acute loss that never fades or goes away.  Our thoughts must be centred on those families.  We must serve them by ensuring that we learn lessons from disasters and avoid the same terrible fate befalling other families.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to what the Deputies said and to the extensive debate we had on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and at various meetings during the lengthy pre-legislative scrutiny by the Department.  I have heard and listened with respect to other Deputies and their views.<\/p> <p>I want to get across my one view as we conclude and, I hope, pass the Bill.  While we all make mistakes in public life and in public service, my experience has been that officials and board members, the vast majority of people I deal with on a daily basis, in this area and in others, are people who are motivated by the very best of intentions and are independent rather than partisan in their approach.  They put civility into public service.  They are professional, competent and committed, and attempt to do their duty which is to care for the public good.  That has been my experience.  There may be cases in which we fail in that high standard but that is what I see in the Department and on the board for which I have responsibility.  I have to stand up for them because I believe it is important that that perspective is also heard.<\/p> <p> In conversations with my officials, they will know this is true, we are looking at all options.  As we said at various stages right the way through this that our systems are not perfect - far from it.  They are in need of reform, modernising and improvement.  We acknowledge and agree with that and I am committed, during the lifetime of this Government, to deliver the sort of marine casualty investigation unit that we would all prefer to see, that is, a unit that is independent and physically located outside.  We will look at perhaps locating it with our air and rail investigation units, so that they can pull together and get some of the benefits of such a co-ordinated approach.<\/p> <p> However, I am conscious that to fully step in that direction, to completely provide the full suite of legislation that we want or need in order to get the most perfect system, brings with it one risk that we cannot accept.  That is that in the time period between the start and finish of such an important legislative organisational process, we risk having a board that would not be able to carry out its functions.  We would leave ourselves and our public exposed.  That is what the Bill is about.  It would quickly ensure that we have a functioning board under the existing system.  We accept the European court judgment and recognise that it has required us to act very quickly and to give us the capability to have a larger board so that it is fully capable of doing the important public work.  That is what the Bill attempts to do.  It does not seek to address all the valid concerns that I listened to - I am perfectly up-front and honest about that - because I want to be quick.  I want to get these people in place as soon as possible.  That is why I call on everyone in the House to support the Bill, because failing to be quick risks leaving us exposed.<\/p> <p> We will, subject to the legal advice from the Attorney General, publish the Clinch report.  We will go to Government with proposals for a new and better organised structure, which we expect and have committed to have by the end of the year.  I look forward to that debate and bringing it through the legislative process, but tonight we need to pass this Bill because we are at risk.  That is the very essence of this whole area.
